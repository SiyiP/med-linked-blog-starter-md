#summary #sensorimotor #anatomy 

- femur = will articulate with tibia, this is the weight bearing bone of the body; no articulation of this with fibula 


gluteal region 
deep group 
- piriformis - sciatic nerve L4-S3
- superior gemellus - nerve to obturator internus 
- obturator internus - nerve to obturator internus 
- inf gemellus -  nerve to quadratus femoris  
- quadratus femoris - nerve to quadratus femoris 
all for **lateral rotation of femur at hip joint** 

superficial groups
- gluteus max - inf gluteal n, superior AND inferior gluteal arteries 
- med - sup + inf gluteal arteries + sup gluteal n 
- minimus - sup + inf gluteal arteries + sup gluteal n 
- tensor fascia lata 
for abduction + extension at hip joint 

**lateral intermuscular septum** - strongest intermuscular septa of THIGH; gonna be pinned, and immediately deep would be vastus lateralis, next to the biceps femoris (both long and short head) 

anterior thigh compartment
- flexion of thigh at hip 
- **extension of leg at knee joint**
- femoral nerve innervation, which enters thigh deep to inguinal ligament
	- cutaneous: anterior thigh, medial knee, leg, ankle, foot
	- motor for anterior compartment 
	- 2 br of femoral thru adductor/subsartorial canal
		- vastus medialis nerve 
		- saphenous nerve (behind vastoadductor membrane, not the adductor hiatus), then goes to popliteal fossa + splits 
		- The adductor canal (subsartorial canal or Hunter’s canal) is a musculofascial canal on the **medial** side of the distal two thirds of the thigh. starts at the inferior angle of the femoral triangle, at the **intersection of the adductor longus and sartorius muscles**. Ends at the musculotendinous opening in the **adductor magnus muscl**e, the **adductor hiatus** (Wong et al., 2017). 
			- —The anterior wall = vastus medialis muscle.
			- The posterior wall (or floor) adductor longus and magnus muscles. 
			- The medial wall (or roof) is formed by a fibrous fascia (called the subsartorial fascia or vastoadductor membrane). 
		- this place also turns the femoral a into the popliteal artery in the back, which is inf to popliteus muscle and just deep to the soleus, giving off the ant/post tibial a. 
- deep femoral a supply 
	- first br of it in the femoral triangle from the dorsal region is this, going to the medial circumflex femoral for retinacular aa 
	- and lateral circumflex femoral 
	- in addition to the 4 perforating brs, **which go into the adductor magnus**
hip joint
- iliacus
- psoas major
- pectineus (does adduction like muscles in the medial place but bc of innervation by the femoral nerve it's anterior compartment)
hip and knee joint - long boys 
- sartorius 
- rectus femoris 
knee joint only 
- vastus medialis
- vastus intermedius
- vastus lateralis 

medial thigh 
- adduction of thigh at hip 
- gracilis 
- adductor longus 
- adductor brevis 
	-  more medial portion = hamstring part , has a tendon
	- with a more muscular adductor part 
- obturator externus = near the top of the compartment 
- innervation by : obturator nerve which also has cutaneous action 
	- **but hamstrings are innervated by the tibial nerve, from the sciatic and keeps going down**
- arteries: obturator a + **deep femoral a as well because of medial circumflex femoral a making anastamoses with the lateral circumflex femoral a on neck + head of femur**

posterior compartment of thigh 
- **rotation** and flexion of leg at knee joint 
- extension of thigh at hip joint 
- - biceps femoris = long head + short head
- semitendoninosus 
- semimembranosus 
- innervation by **sciatic n,-> TIBIAL n except COMMON FIBULAR on the short head of biceps**
	- tibial n also covers the hamstrings of adductor brevis 


leg
anterior 
- dorsiflex + toe extension 
- tibialis anterior 
- extensor hallucis longus 
-  extensor digitorum longus 
- fibularis TERTIUS (also everter)
- innervated by deep fibular nerve of common fibular 
- blood from anterior tibial a (from popliteal a as it becomes a real artery)
