#summary #sensorimotor #anatomy 

- femur = will articulate with tibia, this is the weight bearing bone of the body; no articulation of this with fibula 


gluteal region 
deep group 
- piriformis - sciatic nerve L4-S3
- superior gemellus - nerve to obturator internus 
- obturator internus - nerve to obturator internus 
- inf gemellus -  nerve to quadratus femoris  
- quadratus femoris - nerve to quadratus femoris 
all for **lateral rotation of femur at hip joint** 

superficial groups
- gluteus max - inf gluteal n, superior AND inferior gluteal arteries 
- med - sup + inf gluteal arteries + sup gluteal n 
- minimus - sup + inf gluteal arteries + sup gluteal n 
- tensor fascia lata 
for abduction + extension at hip joint 

**lateral intermuscular septum** - strongest intermuscular septa of THIGH; gonna be pinned, and immediately deep would be vastus lateralis, next to the biceps femoris (both long and short head) 

anterior thigh compartment
- flexion of thigh at hip 
- **extension of leg at knee joint**
- femoral nerve innervation, which enters thigh deep to inguinal ligament
	- cutaneous: anterior thigh, medial knee, leg, ankle, foot
	- motor for anterior compartment 
	- 2 br of femoral thru adductor/subsartorial canal
		- vastus medialis nerve 
		- saphenous nerve (behind vastoadductor membrane, not the adductor hiatus), then goes to popliteal fossa + splits 
		- The adductor canal (subsartorial canal or Hunter’s canal) is a musculofascial canal on the **medial** side of the distal two thirds of the thigh. starts at the inferior angle of the femoral triangle, at the **intersection of the adductor longus and sartorius muscles**. Ends at the musculotendinous opening in the **adductor magnus muscl**e, the **adductor hiatus** (Wong et al., 2017). 
			- —The anterior wall = vastus medialis muscle.
			- The posterior wall (or floor) adductor longus and magnus muscles. 
			- The medial wall (or roof) is formed by a fibrous fascia (called the subsartorial fascia or vastoadductor membrane). 
		- this place also turns the femoral a into the popliteal artery in the back, which is inf to popliteus muscle and just deep to the soleus, giving off the ant/post tibial a. 
- deep femoral a supply 
	- first br of it in the femoral triangle from the dorsal region is this, going to the medial circumflex femoral for retinacular aa 
	- and lateral circumflex femoral 
	- in addition to the 4 perforating brs, **which go into the adductor magnus**
hip joint
- iliacus
- psoas major
- pectineus (does adduction like muscles in the medial place but bc of innervation by the femoral nerve it's anterior compartment)
hip and knee joint - long boys 
- sartorius 
- rectus femoris 
knee joint only 
- vastus medialis
- vastus intermedius
- vastus lateralis 

medial thigh 
- adduction of thigh at hip 
- gracilis 
- adductor longus 
- adductor brevis 
	-  more medial portion = hamstring part , has a tendon
	- with a more muscular adductor part 
- obturator externus = near the top of the compartment 
- innervation by : obturator nerve which also has cutaneous action 
	- **but hamstrings are innervated by the tibial nerve, from the sciatic and keeps going down**
- arteries: obturator a + **deep femoral a as well because of medial circumflex femoral a making anastamoses with the lateral circumflex femoral a on neck + head of femur**

posterior compartment of thigh 
- **rotation** and flexion of leg at knee joint 
- extension of thigh at hip joint 
- - biceps femoris = long head + short head
- semitendoninosus 
- semimembranosus 
- innervation by **sciatic n,-> TIBIAL n except COMMON FIBULAR on the short head of biceps**
	- tibial n also covers the hamstrings of adductor brevis 

leg
anterior 
- dorsiflex + toe extension 
- tibialis anterior 
- extensor hallucis longus 
-  extensor digitorum longus 
- **fibularis TERTIUS (also everter)** 
- innervated by deep fibular nerve of common fibular 
- blood from anterior tibial a (from popliteal a as it becomes a real artery), and then the anterior tibial a will turn into the dorsalis pedis at ankle joint 

lateral = foot everters, helps with some **plantarflexion**
- fibularis longus = headed to the **medial cuneiform at the 1st metatarsal, reinforcing that ARCH**
- fibularis brevis = headed to the **fifth metatarsal,** simiar to the fibularis tertius 
- **superficial fibular nerve, between the longus and brevis** 
	- from the sciatic n 
	- also from the sciatic nerve is the cutaneous supply of lateral sural cutaneous nerve from the popliteal fossa, branch off the common fibular. 
	- superficial fibular nerve = motor lateral, also 1/3 distal anterior surface of leg cutaneous, and cutaneously **majority of foot dorsum**
	- deep fibular nerve = br off common fibular , will be **anterior motor leg, and intrinsic dorsal muscles of foot motor... skin in first web space bt great toe + 2nd.... motor for extensor hallucis brevis + extensor digitorum brevis**
- blood supply = branch of the **fibular artery**

posterior leg
- **nerve for all: tibial n** and all the intrinsic foot muscles **except extensor hallucis brevis + extensor digitorum brevis**
	- will eventually give off medial sural cutaneous nerve 
	- then sural n travels down with small saphenous v, passing thru the soleus and then thru the **tarsal tunnel posterior to medial malleolus to enter plantar foot** 
	- then gives rise to med + lat plantar n , supplying sensory + motor 
		- calcaneal br = of heel, cutaneous 
		- saphenous n innervate most medial of feet on plantar 
		- very lateral of feet on plantar is sural n 
- **blood; posterior tibial a** 
- plantarflexion, flex toes
- gastrocnemius with medial. + lateral head
-  soleus 
- plantaris = little baby up top 
deep
	- popliteus
	- flexor hallucis longus 
	- flexor digitorum longus 
	- tibialis posterior 

"tarsal tunnel" = **deep posterior passage of tendons**
- behind medial malleolus 
- anterior to posterior at tunnel: 
- tom  - tibialis posterior 
- dicked =- flexor digitorum longus 
- a - posterior tibial Artery 
- very - posterior tibial Vein 
- nervous - tibial N (sometimes it'll divide before getting to that space)
- harry - flexor hallucis longus 

knee joint 
-  2 femoral condyles - articulation, flat with full extension with tibial condyles and flexed and curved in flexion 
- 2 tibial condyles
- menisci =  c shaped cartilages = medial and lateral, responsible for accomodating any changes
	-  medial = attached around margin to joint capsule , and to **tibial/medial collateral ligament so any dmg here would dmg this medial meniscus**
	- lateral meniscus = no attachment to capsule so more mobile 
- collateral ligaments = help hinge movements of knee
	- fibular collateral ligament/lateral collateral ligament of knee =  cord like, superior to lateral femoral epicondyle and attach inferior to lateral surface of fibular head, not the lateral meniscus
	- Medial/tibial collateral lig = broad flat, attach to medial femoral epicondyle and then the medial condyle of tibia + tibial shaft and the medial meniscus 
	- - **crossed by the sartorius, gracilis and semitendonis tendons** = the pes ancerinus
- cruciate = **intracapsular ligaments around femur+tibia**
	- anterior cruciate = attaches on ant part of intercondylar area of tibia, ascending posteriorly to attach to posterior part of medial surface of lateral femoral condyele
	- - posterior cruciate lig = posterior aspect of intercondylar area of tibia, like a cross... and will ascend anteriorly to attach to lateral side of medial ffemoral contdyle

pathology 
1. avascular necrosis to femoral head + neck 
	- affected leg shorteend + laterally rotated 
	- thinking of aa disrupted: **medial circumflex a which gives rise to the retinaculars**
	- recall that this is a br of deep femoral a 
	- the acetabular br of obturator a also supplies here but realistically not enough to provide blood alone 
2. lateral strike to right leg during motor collision = **foot drop**
	- **common fibular nerve severance**
	- can't dorsiflex the affected foot 
		- loss of anterior compartment, because it's the loss of **deep fibular nerve** 
		- toes drag on ground, you have to get knee higher than usual
	- decreased dorsum sensation 
		- loss of the **superficial fibular n too**
	- can't evert the foot = loss of lateral compartment
		- **superficial fibular n loss** 
3. small saphenous v harvested from r leg for grafting, post-op tingling in posterolateral aspect of leg + lateral of foot
	- dec cutaneous sensation, but motor nerve chill 
	- **sural nerve dmg'd, posterolateral aspect of leg is sural, a br off the tibial nerve**
