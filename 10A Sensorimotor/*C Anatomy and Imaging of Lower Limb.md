#summary #sensorimotor #anatomy 

in general huge diff of upper vs lower - lower has more impact on the other side if nonpathological, mainly via compensation 

- femur = will articulate with tibia, this is the weight bearing bone of the body; no articulation of this with fibula 

gluteal region 
deep group 
- piriformis - sciatic nerve L4-S3
- superior gemellus - nerve to obturator internus 
- obturator internus - nerve to obturator internus 
- inf gemellus -  nerve to quadratus femoris  
- quadratus femoris - nerve to quadratus femoris 
all for **lateral rotation of femur at hip joint** 

superficial groups
- gluteus max - inf gluteal n (L4-S3), superior AND inferior gluteal arteries 
- med - sup + inf gluteal arteries + sup gluteal n 
- minimus - sup + inf gluteal arteries + sup gluteal n 
- tensor fascia lata 
for abduction + extension at hip joint 

**lateral intermuscular septum** - strongest intermuscular septa of THIGH; gonna be pinned, and immediately deep would be vastus lateralis, next to the biceps femoris (both long and short head) 

anterior thigh compartment
- flexion of thigh at hip 
- **extension of leg at knee joint**
- femoral nerve innervation, which enters thigh deep to inguinal ligament
	- cutaneous: anterior thigh, medial knee, leg, ankle, foot
	- motor for anterior compartment 
	- 2 br of femoral thru adductor/subsartorial canal
		- vastus medialis nerve 
		- saphenous nerve (behind vastoadductor membrane, not the adductor hiatus), then goes to popliteal fossa + splits 
		- The adductor canal (subsartorial canal or Hunter’s canal) is a musculofascial canal on the **medial** side of the distal two thirds of the thigh. starts at the inferior angle of the femoral triangle, at the **intersection of the adductor longus and sartorius muscles**. Ends at the musculotendinous opening in the **adductor magnus muscl**e, the **adductor hiatus** (Wong et al., 2017). 
			- —The anterior wall = vastus medialis muscle.
			- The posterior wall (or floor) adductor longus and magnus muscles. 
			- The medial wall (or roof) is formed by a fibrous fascia (called the subsartorial fascia or vastoadductor membrane). 
		- this place also turns the femoral a into the popliteal artery in the back, which is inf to popliteus muscle and just deep to the soleus, giving off the ant/post tibial a. 
- deep femoral a supply 
	- first br of it in the femoral triangle from the dorsal region is this, going to the medial circumflex femoral for retinacular aa 
	- and lateral circumflex femoral 
	- in addition to the 4 perforating brs, **which go into the adductor magnus**
hip joint
- iliacus
- psoas major
- pectineus (does adduction like muscles in the medial place but bc of innervation by the femoral nerve it's anterior compartment)
hip and knee joint - long boys 
- sartorius 
- rectus femoris 
knee joint only 
- vastus medialis
- vastus intermedius
- vastus lateralis 

thigh's CT
- fascia lata tight af 
- great saphenous v goes thru the saphenous opening to femoral v 
	- falciform margin on lat edge of this opening 
- ilitotibial tract - will thicken on lateral side - **usually this this tightened when our knees and bodies tighten up!**
- insert on tibia, head of fibula, lateral patella with **gluteaus maximus + tensor fasciae latie**
thigh has medial, lateral (very prominent) and posterior intermuscular septa 
- all have cutaneous nerves L1-4 
medial thigh - br of obturator internus 
- adduction of thigh at hip 
- gracilis 
- adductor longus 
- adductor brevis 
	-  more medial portion = hamstring part , has a tendon
	- with a more muscular adductor part 
- obturator externus = near the top of the compartment 
- innervation by : obturator nerve which also has cutaneous action 
	- **but hamstrings are innervated by the tibial nerve, from the sciatic and keeps going down**
- arteries: obturator a + **deep femoral a as well because of medial circumflex femoral a making anastamoses with the lateral circumflex femoral a on neck + head of femur**
posterior compartment of thigh 
- **rotation** and flexion of leg at knee joint 
- extension of thigh at hip joint 
- - biceps femoris = long head + short head
- semitendoninosus 
- semimembranosus 
- innervation by **sciatic n,-> TIBIAL n except COMMON FIBULAR on the short head of biceps**
	- tibial n also covers the hamstrings of adductor brevis 
	- **cutaneously innervated by the *posterior femoral cutaneous nerve*, from the sacral plexus** ( L4-5, S1-4 )
lateral compartment of thigh 
- innervation by the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 
anterior thigh compartment
- anterior femoral cutaneous n of femoral n 
- **femoral nerve**
in the thigh: femoral triangle 
- inguinal ligament
- medial border of sartorius M 
- medial border of adductor longus m 
- this is covereed by fascia lata 
has (lateral to medial is NAV)
- femoral N
- femoral A 
	- goes to deep femoral a br 
	- medial circumflex femoral a comes from here 
	- 		- lateral circumflex femoral a - **pass bt iliacus and rectus femoris**
	- 		- perforating br = for tremendous collateral circulation, esp when the vessels wrap around the bone. 
		- these supply + pierce the adductor brevis and magnus muscles to eventually reach posterior thigh 
	- femoral A becomes popliteal A going thru adductor hiatus 
- femoral v 

femoral sheath = continues posterior to inguinal ligament into the femoral triangle. note that the femoral n is not in the sheath but still behind the iliacus fascia. 
- inside the sheath = femoral a + v 
- femoral ring = thickened medial edge of the femoral canal itself , the ring (lymphatics, medial)

neck + head of femur
- retinacular aa , lat + med circumflex aas 
- - the acitabular br of the obturator artery also supplies the head and neck 

leg -> crural fascia, very tight . 
- has anterior, posterior, and transverse intermuscular septae, making anterior, lateral, and posterior superficial + deep posterior compartments 
anterior 
- dorsiflex + toe extension 
- tibialis anterior 
- extensor hallucis longus 
-  extensor digitorum longus 
- **fibularis TERTIUS (also everter)** 
- innervated by deep fibular nerve of common fibular
	- this will supply dorsum of foot, closer to the big toe and the area bt 1st and 2nd toe. 
- blood from anterior tibial a (from popliteal a as it becomes a real artery), and then the anterior tibial a will turn into the dorsalis pedis at ankle joint 
- anteriorly is the great saphenous vein, continuing down to the **dorsal venous arch medial side**
- in the leg, we also have that prominent saphenous nerve emerging down to the medial knee ... drains to the **femoral vein at the saphenous opening**
medial 
- innervated by the medial cutaneous br of the saphenous n will innervate, along with the infrapatellar br of saphenous n 
lateral = foot everters, helps with some **plantarflexion**
- fibularis longus = headed to the **medial cuneiform at the 1st metatarsal, reinforcing that ARCH**
- fibularis brevis = headed to the **fifth metatarsal,** simiar to the fibularis tertius 
- **superficial fibular nerve, between the longus and brevis** 
	- from the sciatic n 
	- also from the sciatic nerve is the cutaneous supply of lateral sural cutaneous nerve from the popliteal fossa, branch off the common fibular. 
		- like under the calf sensation 
	- superficial fibular nerve = motor lateral, also 1/3 distal anterior surface of leg cutaneous, and cutaneously **majority of foot dorsum**
	- deep fibular nerve = br off common fibular , will be **anterior motor leg, and intrinsic dorsal muscles of foot motor... skin in first web space bt great toe + 2nd.... motor for extensor hallucis brevis + extensor digitorum brevis**
- blood supply = branch of the **fibular artery**
posterior leg
- **nerve for all: tibial n** and all the intrinsic foot muscles **except extensor hallucis brevis + extensor digitorum brevis**
	- will eventually give off medial **sural cutaneous nerve** 
	- then **sural n** travels down with small saphenous v, passing thru the soleus and then thru the **tarsal tunnel posterior to medial malleolus to enter plantar foot** 
	- then gives rise to med + lat plantar n , supplying sensory + motor 
		- calcaneal br = of heel, cutaneous 
		- saphenous n innervate most medial of feet on plantar 
		- very lateral of feet on plantar is sural n 
- **blood; posterior tibial a** 
- small saphenous v = posterior and will **pierce into the popliteal vein eventually, from the lateral side of dorsal venous arch**
- plantarflexion, flex toes
- gastrocnemius with medial. + lateral head
-  soleus 
- plantaris = little baby up top 
deep
	- popliteus
	- flexor hallucis longus 
	- flexor digitorum longus 
	- tibialis posterior 

"tarsal tunnel" = **deep posterior passage of tendons**
- behind medial malleolus 
- anterior to posterior at tunnel: 
- tom  - tibialis posterior 
- dicked =- flexor digitorum longus 
- a - posterior tibial Artery 
- very - posterior tibial Vein 
- nervous - tibial N (sometimes it'll divide before getting to that space)
- harry - flexor hallucis longus 

knee joint 
-  2 femoral condyles - articulation, flat with full extension with tibial condyles and flexed and curved in flexion 
- 2 tibial condyles
- menisci =  c shaped cartilages = medial and lateral, responsible for accomodating any changes
	-  medial = attached around margin to joint capsule , and to **tibial/medial collateral ligament so any dmg here would dmg this medial meniscus**
	- lateral meniscus = no attachment to capsule so more mobile 
- collateral ligaments = help hinge movements of knee
	- fibular collateral ligament/lateral collateral ligament of knee =  cord like, superior to lateral femoral epicondyle and attach inferior to lateral surface of fibular head, not the lateral meniscus
	- Medial/tibial collateral lig = broad flat, attach to medial femoral epicondyle and then the medial condyle of tibia + tibial shaft and the medial meniscus 
	- - **crossed by the sartorius, gracilis and semitendonis tendons** = the pes ancerinus
- cruciate = **intracapsular ligaments around femur+tibia**
	- anterior cruciate = attaches on ant part of intercondylar area of tibia, ascending posteriorly to attach to posterior part of medial surface of lateral femoral condyele
	- - posterior cruciate lig = posterior aspect of intercondylar area of tibia, like a cross... and will ascend anteriorly to attach to lateral side of medial ffemoral contdyle 

ankle 
- crural fascia thickened at the ankle = will become the retinacula = allows for movement to take place by holding the tendons. 
- flexor = medial 
- extensor = anterior + dorsum 

foot
on the dorsum nerves : all from sciatic
- superficial fibular nerve which would innervate lateral compartment of leg will become s**uperficial to dorsum of foot**
- deep fibular nerve which would pass into the foot becomes **cutaneous to the web space in between first and 2nd digits**
plantar nerves
- p much all from innervation of tibial nn 
- common nerves vs when it bifurcates for toes, naming very simillar to palmar hands. 
- entrance of **medial plantar and lateral plantar from tibial n**
![[dermatomes of lower limb.png]]


***gluteal region*** = these are medial rotators 
- the region between iliac crest and gluteal fold 
hip bones 
- acetabulum = middle divot on lateral side of ilium made of 3 parts
	- ilium (iac tubercle where ligaments attach to, gluteal lines = attachments for muscles, ASIS and AIIS , PSIS and PIIS , with **greater sciatic notch**)
	- ischium = what we sit on - ischial spine, etc... 
	- pubis 
- femur - has head with fovea capitis, artery attached to it 
	- has an **intertrochanteric crest** instead of a bicipital groove bt the greater + lesser trochanters 
	- gluteal tuberosity = where gluteus maximus attaches to 
- sacroiliac joint - strong synovial joints bt auricular surfaces of iliac and sacrum 
	- - strong posterior + interosseus sacroiliac ligaments
	- anterior sacroiliac ligament on anterior aspect of joint give rise to sacrotuberous + sacrospinous ligaments, which make the notches become foramina 
- greater sciatic foramen: superior + inf gluteal aa and nns. and the n to quadratus femoris 
- lesser sciatic foramen: sacrotuberous ligament passing thru 
- but **passing thru poth - out the greater into the lesser: pudendal n, internal pudendal a , and n to obturator internus** (L5-S1)
	- recall: PIN is from medial to lateral 

gluteus maximus = - entire reason we walk upright 
- inserts onto the iliotibial tract + gluteal tuberosity of femur!!!
-  **inferior** gluteal nerve 
	- extends and laterally rotates hip joint (entire lower limb)
	- extends trunk at hip when lower extremity is fixed (helps straighten core when you're fixed)
	- can contribute to knee joint extension **(note that the iliotibial tract runs below the knee), so when it's connected to this tract it can help**
gluteus medius 
- - innervation by superior gluteal nerve (L4,5,S1)
- will insert into the **lateral upper surface of greater trochanter** 
	- note how it's high and lateral
	- meaning - **will do abduction of thigh at hip joint, and medially rotates the thigh (medial rotation bc it's the anterior lateral surface insertion, it pulls up when contracting)**
gluteus minimus
- - inserts onto anterior + upper surface of greater trochanter 
- - innervation superior gluteal nerve 
- - will abduct thigh at hip jjoint
- - prevents down tilt of pelvis on the opposite side when foot's anchored.  + medial rotator like all the other gluetus muscles 

tensor fasciae lata - smaller muscle - 
-  outermost edge of iliac crest, going from the anterior superior iliac spine to the iliac tubercle... 
- inserts onto anterior aspect of iliotibial tract ... near the front 
- - innervation by the superior gluteal nerve 
- - thigh abductor... medial rotation bc insertion near front, and contributes to knee extension 

deep muscles
- piriformis - 	- from antero-lateral border of sacrum, thru the greater sciatic foramen 
	- 	- insertion onto the upper medial aspect of greater trochanter, so you pull it forwards, making thigh laterally rotate. 
	- innervated by the **anterior rami of 1st/2nd S1-2 sacral spinal nerves**
- - superior gemellus 0 below piriformis **n of obturator internus**
- obturator internus - between, **n of obturator internus**
- inferior femellus  - **n of the quadratus femorus**
- quadratus femoris  - **n of the quadratus femoris **, (L5-S1)
	- pretty prominent, between greater and lessr trochanters
- all other short lateral rotators o hip joint which counteract their medial rotators of the butt muscles 

blood supply: 
common iliac -> internal iliac 
	- posterior division/trunk -> superior gluteal = 
	- anterior trunk -> inf gluteal 
	- anterior trunk -> internal pudendal 

try to give injections and shots into the upper lateral quadrant, bc the nerve to the **sciatic is like in the lower medial quadrant of gluteal region...**

cutaneous nn of gluteal - 4 quadrants
1. upper medial = superior + middle cluneal nn (ez to id),
2. upper lateral = lateral cutaneous br of iliohypogastric + ventral ramus of t12_
3. lower lateral/**femoral** = lat cutaneus nn of thigh , ventral rami L2-3
4. lower medial = posterior cutaneous nn of thigh = inferior cluneal nn, ventral rami s1-3 
cruciate anastamoses 
- on the posterior aspect of thigh, where internal iliac. + femoral aa can connect 


-
*thigh and popliteal fossa*
- fascia lata: - at the most superior aspect, there's the **saphenous opening , allowing the great saphenous vein to drain the leg anteriorly**  
intermuscular septa:
- lateral (strongest, should see it in lab, going from the iliotibial tract to the linea aspera of the femur)
- medial
- posterior 
compartments
anterior - **femoral nerve innervation**, **profunda femoris a**
- sartorius - ASIS to upper medial surface of tibia , flexes knee + weakly abducts + laterally rotates thigh 
- iliacus - iliacus + psoas. 
	- 	- more distal aspect of muscle: smaller, teardropped shape called "iliopsoas" - **this will flex thigh + stabilize hip joint**
- psoas - medial , insert on lesser trochanter , combine to make iliopsoas 
- pectineus - from sup ramus of pubis insertion to just inf of lesser trochanter at **linea aspera**, crossing hip joint 
	- flex + adducts thigh 
- quadriceps:
	- rectus femoris - flex hip at thigh, extend leg at knee by common insertion of quads tendon on patella via patellar ligament , which goes into tibial tuberosity 
	- vastus lateralis - 
	- vastus medialis 
		- lower fibrs = almost horizontal to prevent lateral sliding of patella during forceful contraction 
	- vastus intermedius - **articularis genus = lowest fibers on the knee to elevate synovium during extension**
innervation is - **medial + intermediate anterior cutaneous nerves to thigh** + sartorius and pectineus muscular branches
- the saphenous nerve = goes thru subsartorius cannel thru the knee to the medial foot+leg 
	- **this adductors cannal is covered by the vastoadductor membrane, which covers the hiatus**
	- this canal is going from the apex of femoral triangle to the hiatus in the adductor magnus 
**patellar reflex = L2-4**
femoral artery = from external iliac
- profunda femoris - first branch out immediately 
	- medial circumflex femoral = portion of medial aspect of thigh AND head/neck of femur
	-  lateral  circumflex femoral= 
	- 4 perforating br = bc they **perforate the adductor magnus to supply mm of the posterior compartment
- descending genicular to knee joint
- popliteal a = thru the adductor hiatus this becomes this, and then provides 5 genicular br to knee joionts. 
	- later splits into ant/post tibial aa 
at point of the femoral triangle, lowest point = we see stacked femoral + profunda femoral vessels
- femoral artery 
- femoral v 
- profunda femoris a
- profunda femoris v 
basically from top to bottom those are listed 
-> somewhere below the apex of the triangle, likely in the adductor canal, they are oriented to see the 
- femoral artery 
- femoral v 
- **adductus longus muscle, which will separate the stack**
- profunda femoris a
- - profunda femoris v 

medial compartment of thigh - innervation by obturator nerve except for half o fthe adductor magnus 
	- anterior br (in relation to adductor brevis) = gracilis, adductor brevis + longus, skin of medial thigh 
	- posterior br - bt adductor brevis + magnus , obturator externus, adductor magnus except hamstring , and brevis + skin to medial knee 
artery is still the deep formal a and obturator aa
	- medial circumflex femoral br and muscular br 
	- obtturatoor a gives rise to acetabular br for the femoral head 
	- internal iliac nodes + deep inguinal 
- gracilis - very weak adductor can be used for transplant and insert to superior part of medial tibia 
- adductor longus - only superficial layer muscle - into middle 1/3 of linea aspera 
	- "riders strain" = commnly ossified in riders 
- adductor brevis - inf pubic ramus to insert onto upper part of linea aspera superior to adductor longus insertion 
- adductor magnus - 
	- origin= ischiopubic ramus + ischial tuberosity 
	- 2 parts 
		- adductor part = bigger, insertion of shaft of femur, linea aspera
		- hamstring part = by rounded tendon into adductor **tubercle** , more posterior? and going into more lower space 
		- **the gap bt these inserting fibers = adductor hiatus transmitting femoral vessels into popliteal fossa
- obturator externus - **only deep layer muscle, reflect adductor brevis + pectineus to see this** = this only laterally rotates the thigh 

-
foot + ankle
foot arches: 3 of these
- medial longitudinal arch = calcaneus - like the ball of the foot in the back, talus (keystone, connects the fibula/tibia with foot), navicular- squishy and medial, 3 cuneiforms- medial, intermediate, lateral + medial 3 metatarsal bones 
- lateral longitudinal arch = calcaneus, cuboid (keystone, large and rectangular and latera), and 4/5th metatarsal bones 
- transverse arch = bases of metatarsal bones, cuboid + 3 cuneiforms = mid point of foot , down the middle 
arches allow us to walk on uneven surfaces and round surfaces!!!! 

anterior + posterior crural intermuscular septa + interosseous memb divide into compartments: 
	- anterior - ant tibial a , some from ant tibial recurrent a or medial malleolar aa ... and all innervated by deep fibular 
	- lateral - fibular a , posterior tibial a branch is here and will split into this. nerve is superficial ibua
	- posterior 
		- also a deep transverse septum that splits posterior into posterior deep and superficial 

---
pathology 
1. avascular necrosis to femoral head + neck 
	- affected leg shorteend + laterally rotated 
	- thinking of aa disrupted: **medial circumflex a which gives rise to the retinaculars**
	- recall that this is a br of deep femoral a 
	- the acetabular br of obturator a also supplies here but realistically not enough to provide blood alone 
2. lateral strike to right leg during motor collision = **foot drop**
	- **common fibular nerve severance**
	- can't dorsiflex the affected foot 
		- loss of anterior compartment, because it's the loss of **deep fibular nerve** 
		- toes drag on ground, you have to get knee higher than usual
	- decreased dorsum sensation 
		- loss of the **superficial fibular n too**
	- can't evert the foot = loss of lateral compartment
		- **superficial fibular n loss** 
3. small saphenous v harvested from r leg for grafting, post-op tingling in posterolateral aspect of leg + lateral of foot
	- dec cutaneous sensation, but motor nerve chill 
	- **sural nerve dmg'd, posterolateral aspect of leg is sural, a br off the tibial nerve**
![[cutaneous innervation of lower limb.png]]
memorize cutaneous innervation of lower limb^^
4. compartment syndrome
	- very high risk in nondistendable tight fascia like crural fascia, where it's super strong in the leg. 
	- 6 Ps of this: Pain, Pallor (paleness), Paresthesia (numbness/tingling), Paralysis, Pulselessness, and Poikilothermia (abnormal temperature, often coolness) 
5. varicose veins 
	- with incompetent valves, they can't push the blood flow to heart well, making them swell and bulge with flow reversal
	- many superficial veins will distend, and these superficial veins will connect to the deep veins so that wont't work 
6. positive trendelenburg's sign
	- decr strength oof gluteus medius + minimus due to trauma/dz on one side = "dropped pelvis"
	- therefore dmg to the superior gluteal nns 
7. piriformis syndrome
	- can happen as a result of early division too above the piriformis bc it can be squished by this 
	- pain in butt, seen in 15-20% of population where the sciatic nerve crosses below the piriformis, but the muscle splits .... so it presses on your sciatic nerve 
	- pain down posterior leg 
	- foot orthotic, biomech issue, examine sacroiliac joint/hip joint, typially mssage , ice
8. sacroiliac joint dysfunction
	- - excessive movement in the joint, maybe trauma caused. 
	- can eventually lead to piriformis syndrom as a degenerative arthritis 
	- pregnancy can see this 
	- pain in lower back, back of hips + lessor exent groin+thigh
	- get them anti-inflammatories and physical therapy 
9. adductor longus ossificaiton = "riders strain"
10.
