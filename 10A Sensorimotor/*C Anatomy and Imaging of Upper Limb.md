#summary #sensorimotor #anatomy 
no overview to launch off of, simply start w/ superficia back and shoulders with special section for pathology all throughout 

superficial back muscles are all innervated by ==ventral primary rami/nerves from ventral primary rami, which comes from the ventral root== 
the true/deep back muscles are innervated by dorsal primary rami

usually origins are vertebral spinous process except levator scapulae from transverse. 

the insertion is usually on scapula, except for latissimus dorsi (on the humerus's floor of bicipital groove)

humerus has the greater + lesser tubercles, with the intertubercular sulcus/bicipital groove in between and inferior to it = for latissimus dorsi insertion 
radial groove = large groove on the posterior side, for the proximal brachialis m to attach 

trapezius 
- originates from skull, ligamentum nuchae, spinous processes of C7 and all 12 thoracic vertebrae 
- unusual attachments to lat 1/3 superior clavicle 
- will elevate scapula, middle fibers retract it. and lower ones pull medial border of scapula, making glenoid fossa pull up 
- innervation: **spinal accessory n (motor) and br of ventral primary rami C3-4 (sensory)**
- blood supply - **superficial br transverse cervical a**

latissimus dorsi 
- from iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia + spinous processes etc, insertion into bicipital groove
- adduction, and on shoulders, **extension + internal rotation** and arm depression. 
- **when arms are straight up, it'll stabilize the trunk, moving upwards**
- innervation: **thoracodorsal n... from ULTRA posterior BP cord, between upper/lower subscapular nn**

deep layer
levator scapulae 
- from transverse processes of C1-4 
- insertion at superior angle @ superior portion of medial border of scapula 
- elevate scapula + rotates inferiorly , similar to trapezius. 
- innervation: **dorsal scapular n and ventral primary rami of C3/4**
rhomboid major
- from spine of 2-5 thoracic insertions
- innervation: **dorsal scapular n** , for both major + minor 
- holds scapula onto ribcage + abducts it + elevates medial border of scapula , downward rotation 
- **deep br transverse cervical artery**
rhomboid minor
- from ligamentum nuchae + spines of 7C and 1T vertebrae
- innervation also the **dorsal scapular n**
- insertion immediately medial to root of scapular spine 

shoulders - SITS rootator cuff
superficial 
deltoid mms 
- from spine of scapula/clavicle, inserting on humerus, crossing only one joint glenohumeral joint
- 	- stabilizes and produces movements at shoulder joint
- to deloid tuberosity duh 
- abduction (up and down flap of arm), flexion, extension 
- **axillary n C5-6**
supraspinatus m 
- from supraspinous fossa of scapula, inserts on greater tubercle of humerus + CAPSULE of shoulder joint
	- ==abducts to about 60%, note that it's mainly on the INSIDE. if you abduct more, that's gonna be the delts.== 
- INNERVATION: C5-6 suprascapular nerve runs underneath 
- also the suprascapular artery 
- most commonly torn in rotator cufs
infraspinatous muscles 
- from infraspinatus fossa, insert on **greater tubercle** of humerus + capsule of shoulder joint 
- retraction, pulling things back, external rotation.... in 2 muscles
- - INNERVATION: C5-6 **suprascapular nerve r**uns underneath 
subscapularis mm
- the subscapular fossa of scapula, inserting on the **lesser tuberosity of the humerus
- contract your arms inward
- C5-6 l**ower subscapular nn and upper subscapular nn** 
	- these are both from the posterior cord of the BP 
teres **minor**  = part of rotator cuff
- lateral border of scapula 
- minor on the top 2/3 , inserts onto greater tubercle of humerus + capsule of shoulder joint 
- lateral rotation 
- medial rotation + abduction
- **axillary n C5-6** from ULTRA posterior cord
major - anterior, insertion on medial lip of bicipital cord
- medial rotation + abduction 
- C5-6 **lower subscapular nerves only**

anatomical spaces
- quadrangular space 
	- superior = teres minor
	- inferior = teres major
	- lateral = surg neck of humerus 
	- medially long head of triceps 
	- **contents = axillary nerve + posterior circumflex humeral vessels** 
	- this looks like a shortish small rectangle , or a trapezoid 
- triangular space = medial to that = teres minor/major
	- lateral = long head of triceps = contents of the **circumflex scapular vessels** 
note about the suprascapular nerve = this is from lateral br of superior TRUNK of BP, but sometimes the arteries run on top of these, army above the navy. 


***Deep back, vert column + spinal cord***
33 verte, 24 true ones bc there are remaining 9 fused 5 sacral and 4 coccygeal 
- 12 t, 7 C, 5 L 

2 primary concavities / curvatures = **thoracic + sacral**
2ndary = convexities = Cervical + lumbar 

typically - vertebral arch (made of 2 pedicles), then posterior to those 2 laminae (connection to the spinous process)
- each facet = 	- will be covered with hyaline cartilage, allows for smooth articulation with intervertebral disk 
parts of intervertebral disc 
- nucleus pulposus = gel cushion , water, proteoglycans
- annulus fibrosis = surrounds it, fibrocartilage, rich in collagen T1 , orthagonally arranged around nucleus, oriented in many directions = allows for **shock absorption**

CERVICAL vertebrae - **foramen seen in transverse process , foramen transversarium**, bifid spinous process except C1/7 
- ==passage of vertebral vein thru all 7 C vertebrae, and artery passes thru upper 6== 
- ==groove seen on very sides anterior for a spinal nerve; rests in the groove upon exit thru intervretebral foramen== 
- ==uncinate process = associated with surface of disk (recall uncinate process of pancreas, looks like HOOK esp on the side)
	- on the sideview, the intervertebral joints look like a smiley face 
	- articulate the superior articular facets with infrior articular facets to make facet joints 
- triangular large foramen 
C1 = no vertebral body nor spinous process = **has anterior and posterior arch with superior articular surfaces covered with hyaline cartilage to occipital condyles 
C2 = odontoid process, at superior processs / dens
note: ==cruciate ligament of 3 parts , for movement of head shaking "no"== 
		- ==transverse ligament of atlas==
		- ==superior + inferior longitudinal bands (stabilizes association of dens of axis w/ anterior arch of atlas)==
thoracic verte
- heart shaped, smaller foramen, on each side has costal artciular facets to articulate with the **matching rib head**
- costal facet on transverse processes to articulate with the **tubercle of matching rib**
	- none on the t11-12 bc ribs foating tho 
lumbar
- large and bean shaped 
- very thick pedicles 
- mammalarry processes - which are diagonal and next to spinous processes at end of articular facets + accessory processes on posterior of transverse processes **for the muscular connections to the deep back....**

lumbar vertebral **ligaments**
	- ==anterior longitudinal ligament will run thru length of anterior vertebral body== 
		- what's directly on top, anterior and running straight down on the spine itself
	- ==posterior longitudinal ligament on the posterior part of vertebral body = smaller than the broad anterior one , at **midline of posterior body** with horizontal portions that **incompletely** covers intervertebral space.== 
		- this is right on the back of the lumbar body, yes posterior but not quite the most posterior. 
		==- so if you get a HERNIATION of the disc, its more likely to be a posterior lateral==  
	- ==ligamentum flavum = extends **between** adjacent laminae along the length of spinal cord and bc of this connection, this will prevent hyperflexion of spinal cord!!==
		- very nice and yellow , between adjacent laminae AKA parts leading up to the spinous processes 
	- ==interspinous ligament = between spinal processes==
		- very broad and well-spread out 
	- ==posterior surface of the spinous processes = **supraspinous ligamen**t, which will expand into the ***ligamentum nucae* in the cervical region!==
		- right on the most posterior, they are literally on the TIPs of the spinous processes, on the very back.**

sacral 
- superior articulation L5-S1, with intervertebral disk 
- fused 5 sacral 
- S1 = sacral promontory 

spinal cord
- 2 enlargements: C5-T1 and lumbosacral L2-3 
- 31 pairs spinal segmental nerves
-  Cervical - leaves in horizontal trajectory, with C8 exiting below C7, right above the T1 
- all others have their corresponding nerve exit below numbered vertebrae... 
- like T12 all below numbered vertebrae 
- S1-4 yes but 
- **S5-1C = pass thru sacral ccanal**
- white matter = axons, gray = bodies
each spinal nerve = attached to spinal cord by ==ventral root = motor==
	- and ==dorsal root = sensory== 
	- length of root inc from C-L 
spinal cord = enclosed in these meninges
- dura mater 
- arachnoid - ==separated from internal layer, pia mater, by subarachnoid space filled with CSF==
- pia mater - deep vascularized, **ends at L1 with filum terminale, which are CT extening into sacral vertebrae in the dural sack. then continue beyond that to the coccyx**
- denticulate ligaments -  extend laterally from dura, which will separate ventral from dorsal roots and anchor pia mater to dura mater

blood supply to the spinal cord
- 	- ==2 posterior spinal aa and anterior spinal a==
- 	- ==radicular arteries from segmental spinal artery will enter thru intervertebral foramina to anastomose with anterior/posterior spinal aa== 
- 	- ==paired vertebral aa from *aorta*: intercostal + lumbar arteries!!! ==
venous drainage
- - ==valveless veins, internal vertebral plexus + external vertebral venous plexus==
-  ==internal vertebral venous plexus is in the foramen but OUTSIDE dura mater!== 

deep back muscles/true back muscles
- erector spinae 
- all innervation by **dorsal primary rami of spinal nerves, all postural**
- spinus medial 
- longissimus - lateral more
- iliocostalis - the most lateral
- "SLI from the midline"

transversospinalis - also all postural, helps us rotate our trunk 
- semispinalis
- multifidus
- rotatores - most lateral 

intertransversali and interspinales = hardest to see but all postural and helps allow rotation 
- bt adjacent transverse processes
- bt adjacent spinal processes?? 
for **lumbar punctures, safest place to prick is L3/4 or L4/5 bc cord terminatest with L1**
	position: go from 
	==ligaments (supraspinatous, interspinatis, and ligamentum flavum) -> the extradural space, then puncture the dura, then the filum terminale to harvest fluid==

pathology
1. rotator cuff tears - most commonly the supraspinatus tear
	- more dmg at older age
	- shoulder instability, limt ROM, trouble elevating arm 
	- reduction in space for supraspinatus muscle, with more acromion peaking thru over time in older ppl 
2. herniations or protrusions of lubmar disc... 
	- L4-5 injuyry, L5 is irritated.... 
	- in C4-5 injuries, C5 compressed horizontally going out. 
	- in sacral ones L5-S1 = the **S1 sacral root is being punished**
3.
