no overview to launch off of, simply start w/ superficia back and shoulders with special section for pathology all throughout 

superficial back muscles are all innervated by ==ventral primary rami/nerves from ventral primary rami, which comes from the ventral root== 
the true/deep back muscles are innervated by dorsal primary rami

usually origins are vertebral spinous process except levator scapulae from transverse. 

the insertion is usually on scapula, except for latissimus dorsi (on the humerus's floor of bicipital groove)

humerus has the greater + lesser tubercles, with the intertubercular sulcus/bicipital groove in between and inferior to it = for latissimus dorsi insertion 
radial groove = large groove on the posterior side, for the proximal brachialis m to attach 

trapezius 
- originates from skull, ligamentum nuchae, spinous processes of C7 and all 12 thoracic vertebrae 
- unusual attachments to lat 1/3 superior clavicle 
- will elevate scapula, middle fibers retract it. and lower ones pull medial border of scapula, making glenoid fossa pull up
