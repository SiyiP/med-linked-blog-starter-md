#summary #sensorimotor #anatomy 
no overview to launch off of, simply start w/ superficia back and shoulders with special section for pathology all throughout 

superficial back muscles are all innervated by ==ventral primary rami/nerves from ventral primary rami, which comes from the ventral root== 
the true/deep back muscles are innervated by dorsal primary rami

usually origins are vertebral spinous process except levator scapulae from transverse. 

the insertion is usually on scapula, except for latissimus dorsi (on the humerus's floor of bicipital groove)

humerus has the greater + lesser tubercles, with the intertubercular sulcus/bicipital groove in between and inferior to it = for latissimus dorsi insertion 
radial groove = large groove on the posterior side, for the proximal brachialis m to attach 

trapezius 
- originates from skull, ligamentum nuchae, spinous processes of C7 and all 12 thoracic vertebrae 
- unusual attachments to lat 1/3 superior clavicle 
- will elevate scapula, middle fibers retract it. and lower ones pull medial border of scapula, making glenoid fossa pull up 
- innervation: **spinal accessory n (motor) and br of ventral primary rami C3-4 (sensory)**
- blood supply - **superficial br transverse cervical a**

latissimus dorsi 
- from iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia + spinous processes etc, insertion into bicipital groove
- adduction, and on shoulders, **extension + internal rotation** and arm depression. 
- **when arms are straight up, it'll stabilize the trunk, moving upwards**
- innervation: **thoracodorsal n... from ULTRA posterior BP cord, between upper/lower subscapular nn**

deep layer
levator scapulae 
- from transverse processes of C1-4 
- insertion at superior angle @ superior portion of medial border of scapula 
- elevate scapula + rotates inferiorly , similar to trapezius. 
- innervation: **dorsal scapular n and ventral primary rami of C3/4**
rhomboid major
- from spine of 2-5 thoracic insertions
- innervation: **dorsal scapular n** , for both major + minor 
- holds scapula onto ribcage + abducts it + elevates medial border of scapula , downward rotation 
- **deep br transverse cervical artery**
rhomboid minor
- from ligamentum nuchae + spines of 7C and 1T vertebrae
- innervation also the **dorsal scapular n**
- insertion immediately medial to root of scapular spine 

shoulders - SITS rootator cuff
superficial 
deltoid mms 
- from spine of scapula/clavicle, inserting on humerus, crossing only one joint glenohumeral joint
- 	- stabilizes and produces movements at shoulder joint
- to deloid tuberosity duh 
- abduction (up and down flap of arm), flexion, extension 
- **axillary n C5-6**
supraspinatus m 
- from supraspinous fossa of scapula, inserts on greater tubercle of humerus + CAPSULE of shoulder joint
	- ==abducts to about 60%, note that it's mainly on the INSIDE. if you abduct more, that's gonna be the delts.== 
- INNERVATION: C5-6 suprascapular nerve runs underneath 
- also the suprascapular artery 
- most commonly torn in rotator cufs
infraspinatous muscles 
- from infraspinatus fossa, insert on **greater tubercle** of humerus + capsule of shoulder joint 
- retraction, pulling things back, external rotation.... in 2 muscles
- - INNERVATION: C5-6 **suprascapular nerve r**uns underneath 
subscapularis mm
- the subscapular fossa of scapula, inserting on the **lesser tuberosity of the humerus
- contract your arms inward
- C5-6 l**ower subscapular nn and upper subscapular nn** 
	- these are both from the posterior cord of the BP 
teres **minor**  = part of rotator cuff
- lateral border of scapula 
- minor on the top 2/3 , inserts onto greater tubercle of humerus + capsule of shoulder joint 
- lateral rotation 
- medial rotation + abduction
- **axillary n C5-6** from ULTRA posterior cord
major - anterior, insertion on medial lip of bicipital cord
- medial rotation + abduction 
- C5-6 **lower subscapular nerves only**

anatomical spaces
- quadrangular space 
	- superior = teres minor
	- inferior = teres major
	- lateral = surg neck of humerus 
	- medially long head of triceps 
	- **contents = axillary nerve + posterior circumflex humeral vessels** 
	- this looks like a shortish small rectangle , or a trapezoid 
- triangular space = medial to that = teres minor/major
	- lateral = long head of triceps = contents of the **circumflex scapular vessels** 
note about the suprascapular nerve = this is from lateral br of superior TRUNK of BP, but sometimes the arteries run on top of these, army above the navy. 


***Deep back, vert column + spinal cord***
33 verte, 24 true ones bc there are remaining 9 fused 5 sacral and 4 coccygeal 
- 12 t, 7 C, 5 L 

2 primary concavities / curvatures = **thoracic + sacral**
2ndary = convexities = Cervical + lumbar 

typically - vertebral arch (made of 2 pedicles), then posterior to those 2 laminae (connection to the spinous process)
- each facet = 	- will be covered with hyaline cartilage, allows for smooth articulation with intervertebral disk 
parts of intervertebral disc 
- nucleus pulposus = gel cushion , water, proteoglycans
- annulus fibrosis = surrounds it, fibrocartilage, rich in collagen T1 , orthagonally arranged around nucleus, oriented in many directions = allows for **shock absorption**

CERVICAL vertebrae - **foramen seen in transverse process , foramen transversarium**, bifid spinous process except C1/7 
- ==passage of vertebral vein thru all 7 C vertebrae, and artery passes thru upper 6== 
- ==groove seen on very sides anterior for a spinal nerve; rests in the groove upon exit thru intervretebral foramen== 
- ==uncinate process = associated with surface of disk (recall uncinate process of pancreas, looks like HOOK esp on the side)
	- on the sideview, the intervertebral joints look like a smiley face 
	- articulate the superior articular facets with infrior articular facets to make facet joints 
- triangular large foramen 
C1 = no vertebral body nor spinous process = **has anterior and posterior arch with superior articular surfaces covered with hyaline cartilage to occipital condyles 
C2 = odontoid process, at superior processs / dens
note: ==cruciate ligament of 3 parts , for movement of head shaking "no"== 
		- ==transverse ligament of atlas==
		- ==superior + inferior longitudinal bands (stabilizes association of dens of axis w/ anterior arch of atlas)==
thoracic verte
- heart shaped, smaller foramen, on each side has costal artciular facets to articulate with the **matching rib head**
- costal facet on transverse processes to articulate with the **tubercle of matching rib**
	- none on the t11-12 bc ribs foating tho 
lumbar
- large and bean shaped 
- very thick pedicles 
- mammalarry processes - which are diagonal and next to spinous processes at end of articular facets + accessory processes on posterior of transverse processes **for the muscular connections to the deep back....**

lumbar vertebral **ligaments**
	- ==anterior longitudinal ligament will run thru length of anterior vertebral body== 
		- what's directly on top, anterior and running straight down on the spine itself
	- ==posterior longitudinal ligament on the posterior part of vertebral body = smaller than the broad anterior one , at **midline of posterior body** with horizontal portions that **incompletely** covers intervertebral space.== 
		- this is right on the back of the lumbar body, yes posterior but not quite the most posterior. 
		==- so if you get a HERNIATION of the disc, its more likely to be a posterior lateral==  
	- ==ligamentum flavum = extends **between** adjacent laminae along the length of spinal cord and bc of this connection, this will prevent hyperflexion of spinal cord!!==
		- very nice and yellow , between adjacent laminae AKA parts leading up to the spinous processes 
	- ==interspinous ligament = between spinal processes==
		- very broad and well-spread out 
	- ==posterior surface of the spinous processes = **supraspinous ligamen**t, which will expand into the ***ligamentum nucae* in the cervical region!==
		- right on the most posterior, they are literally on the TIPs of the spinous processes, on the very back.**

sacral 
- superior articulation L5-S1, with intervertebral disk 
- fused 5 sacral 
- S1 = sacral promontory 

spinal cord
- 2 enlargements: C5-T1 and lumbosacral L2-3 
- 31 pairs spinal segmental nerves
-  Cervical - leaves in horizontal trajectory, with C8 exiting below C7, right above the T1 
- all others have their corresponding nerve exit below numbered vertebrae... 
- like T12 all below numbered vertebrae 
- S1-4 yes but 
- **S5-1C = pass thru sacral ccanal**
- white matter = axons, gray = bodies
each spinal nerve = attached to spinal cord by ==ventral root = motor==
	- and ==dorsal root = sensory== 
	- length of root inc from C-L 
spinal cord = enclosed in these meninges
- dura mater 
- arachnoid - ==separated from internal layer, pia mater, by subarachnoid space filled with CSF==
- pia mater - deep vascularized, **ends at L1 with filum terminale, which are CT extening into sacral vertebrae in the dural sack. then continue beyond that to the coccyx**
- denticulate ligaments -  extend laterally from dura, which will separate ventral from dorsal roots and anchor pia mater to dura mater

blood supply to the spinal cord
- 	- ==2 posterior spinal aa and anterior spinal a==
- 	- ==radicular arteries from segmental spinal artery will enter thru intervertebral foramina to anastomose with anterior/posterior spinal aa== 
- 	- ==paired vertebral aa from *aorta*: intercostal + lumbar arteries!!! ==
venous drainage
- - ==valveless veins, internal vertebral plexus + external vertebral venous plexus==
-  ==internal vertebral venous plexus is in the foramen but OUTSIDE dura mater!== 

deep back muscles/true back muscles
- erector spinae 
- all innervation by **dorsal primary rami of spinal nerves, all postural**
- spinus medial 
- longissimus - lateral more
- iliocostalis - the most lateral
- "SLI from the midline"

transversospinalis - also all postural, helps us rotate our trunk 
- semispinalis
- multifidus
- rotatores - most lateral 

intertransversali and interspinales = hardest to see but all postural and helps allow rotation 
- bt adjacent transverse processes
- bt adjacent spinal processes?? 
for **lumbar punctures, safest place to prick is L3/4 or L4/5 bc cord terminatest with L1**
	position: go from 
	==ligaments (supraspinatous, interspinatis, and ligamentum flavum) -> the extradural space, then puncture the dura, then the filum terminale to harvest fluid== 


deep brachii artery = supplies postrior compartment of arm, parallelling the radial n inside the radial grooove and eventually giving ascnding br to shoulder joint 
- understand = collateral descend, recurrent ascend!!! 
collaterals: 
	- profundal brachii artery gives rise to radial and middle collateral a
	- from brachial a, we give superior + inferior ulnar collateral, which are on medial aspect
recurrrents: 
	- radial a -> radial recurrent a
	- ulnar a -> anterior + posterior ulcer recurrent a 
inside the cubital fossa
TAN lateral to medial 
	- biceps brachii tendon 
	- brachial artery 
	- median nerve 

lymphatics 
- lateral = empties into infraclavicular nodes which then drain to apical nodes of axilla 
- medial = empty into lateral axillary nodes 
	- also hands/forearms can also drain into the cubital nodes or straight into lateral axillary nodes

- subclavian artery above the rib -> axillary artery 
		- part 1 = first branch is **superior thoracic artery** , extends to outer border of the first rib 
			- supplies intercostal regions from outside in 
		- part 2 = thoraco-acromial trunk, lateral thoracic artery, covered by pec minor 
			- thoraco-aromial trunk (branches supply many structures on the thoracic wall)
			- distal border will have the lateral thoracic artery - **most importantly supplying the breast/ribcage**
		- 3rd part - subscapular artery, anterior/posterior humeral circumflex arteries , travels to the humerus , which is the lower border of teres major, which means the axillary artery below this -> brachial artery 
			- subscapular artery down the lateral border of scapula, then at triangular space gives rise to circumflex scapular artery emerging posteriorly 
			- thoracodorsal artery is the continuation of this as it descends, joins thoracodorsal nerve and supplies latissimus dorsi 
			- posterior aspect of the artery: 2 arties the anterior (small) and the larger posterior humeral circumflex artery - will make a circle around the surgecal neck of the humerus 
				- posterior circumflex leaves thru the quadrangular space, along w the axillary nerve. 

BP
		- how is it formed? proximal to distal: Roots (2 branches coming from here) -> trunks(2 branches coming from upper trunk) -> divisions (in first rib/axilla) -> cords -> branches
- ![[brachial plexus.png]]

draingage poitns = in the brachiocephalic veins! 
- all lymphatic drainage in lower = to the lumbar trunks -> thoracic duct -> brachiomedialstinal trunks etc. 
- **head and neck, left side of thorax, all get drained in the left thoracic duct** 
- right upper quarter drained in right jugular trunk, right subclavian etc 
axillary nodes - sets where limbs join the trunk , in the axilla. 
	- PLASCA
	- pectoral = anterior thorax lymph node collection, along the lateral border of pectoralis major 
	- Lateral- along the formation of the axillary vessels of the lower border of teres major 
	- Subscapular - on the anterior surface of subscapularis ; collect lymph from the back 
	- these all drain into Central, tucked under the pectoralis minor
	- then these will train to the apical nodes, which is in deltapentral triangle, then to the cephalic lymph back to vascular system. 
	- start getting involved in immune reactions, seeing edema infection, cancer metastasizes thru lymphatics = see the lymph nodes getting too big. 
	- mammary gland - most breast cancers will drain into the pectoralis nodes 
note - clinically in breast cancer: 
- medial quadrants of breast go to parasternal nodes 
- lateral quadrants to the pectoral nodes
- level one = distal to edge of pec minor 
- all go to central group = level 2 deep to pec minor 
-  apical group = deeper!! seen as level 3 , worst prognosis 

- traditional removal of axillary nodes in these => axillary **dissection causes** **pitting edema** 
- sentinel node biopsy - honor natural flow of lymph to leave more normal lymphatic drainage

radical mascectomy removes everything including muscles of retromammary
- modded radical mascectomy, doing an axillary dissection, leaving muscle intact 


 in the cubital fossa, the connector median cubicle vein is where we draw blood 
		- bicep aponeurosis will blend over the fascia , keeps the needle from going deeper into the artery which you don't wanna do!

pathology
1. rotator cuff tears - most commonly the supraspinatus tear
	- more dmg at older age
	- shoulder instability, limt ROM, trouble elevating arm 
	- reduction in space for supraspinatus muscle, with more acromion peaking thru over time in older ppl 
2. herniations or protrusions of lubmar disc... 
	- L4-5 injuyry, L5 is irritated.... 
	- in C4-5 injuries, C5 compressed horizontally going out. 
	- in sacral ones L5-S1 = the **S1 sacral root is being punished**
3. Clinicians look for a break in the neck of the dog of an oblique view of the lumbar X-ray to indicate a fracture in the region of the pars interarticularis, which is specific for spondylolysis
4. biceps tendinitis = 
	1. - long head of biceps travelling thru intertubercular sulcus of humerus, this tendon is a common issue 0: 
	2. bicep tendon deep to the **transverse humeral ligament, so excessive repetitive movements get it inflamed**
5. rupture of long head of biceps brachii - tendon torn, **popeye defromity**
	1. - "displaced muscle, popeye demformity" = leads to distally displaced belly of biceps is loose and more near forearms
	2.  torn from attachment of the supraglenoid tubercle
	3. snap or pop 
	4. long head can be displaced from the intertubercular sulcus too. 
	5. - can test = **yergason's test** - they flex to 90 degrees , with forearm pronated, externally rotating while supenating, turning out while external rotation 
6. injury to the long thoracic nerve 
	1. innervation of serratus anterior disrupted, so winged sacpula occurs
	2. paralysis of serratus anterior, 
	3. happens with blow to the lateral thoracic wall 
7. upper BP injury ==C5-6== - can happen due to prolonged birth where head is pulled away from shoulder at one side, 
	1. supplies ==nerves to the shoulders, which will droop on that side.== no bicep flexion, thrown hand 
	2. "Erb duchenne palsy" 
8. lower BP injury - when kid falls off cliff but hangs on to a branch, ==C8/T1 affected==
	1. ==ulnar nerve== majorly impacted, bc you get ==claw hand==, which means intrinsic muslces and forearms highly limited 
9. brachial plexus + peripheral nerve injury 
	1. radial nerve impacted, then everything downstream 
	2. shatter on groove of humerus - think of which branches are before that are still intact 
	3. lesion at elbow, think olecranon broken, brachioradilais muscle impacted 
10. compartment syndrome - where strong fascia can have a problem bc when compartment is injured, blood fills inside, making things high pressure
	1.  soft tissue injury -> edema
	- antebrahial fascia 
	- compression of vessels + nerves
	- pain
	- paresthesia,  - numbness/altered sensory 
	- pressure- measureable 
	- pallor/poikilothermia - paleness + loss of temp 
	- paresis = paralysis of that nerve 
	- pulse loss = bc bloods not moving 
	- basically irreversible dmg after 4+ hrs
11. "trigger finger" = any tendon that will arch over the phalanges has a synovial sheath . cyst can occur with infection like tenosynoviits
	have to forciblely push that finger to resist the cyst, 
	- this pops the cyst with a click, so **distal movement of flexor tendon temporarily stopped during extension**
