#summary 
upper limb pathology
1. rotator cuff tears - most commonly the supraspinatus tear
	- more dmg at older age
	- shoulder instability, limt ROM, trouble elevating arm 
	- reduction in space for supraspinatus muscle, with more acromion peaking thru over time in older ppl 
2. herniations or protrusions of lubmar disc... 
	- L4-5 injuyry, L5 is irritated.... 
	- in C4-5 injuries, C5 compressed horizontally going out. 
	- in sacral ones L5-S1 = the **S1 sacral root is being punished**
3. Clinicians look for a break in the neck of the dog of an oblique view of the lumbar X-ray to indicate a fracture in the region of the pars interarticularis, which is specific for spondylolysis
	1. pars interarticularis = mass of bone between superior + inf artiular processes, the neck of boney mass. 
	2. break in the neck of the scotty dog. 
4. biceps tendinitis = 
	1. - long head of biceps travelling thru intertubercular sulcus of humerus, this tendon is a common issue 0: 
	2. bicep tendon deep to the **transverse humeral ligament, so excessive repetitive movements get it inflamed**
5. rupture of long head of biceps brachii - tendon torn, **popeye defromity**
	1. - "displaced muscle, popeye demformity" = leads to distally displaced belly of biceps is loose and more near forearms
	2.  torn from attachment of the supraglenoid tubercle
	3. snap or pop 
	4. long head can be displaced from the intertubercular sulcus too. 
	5. - can test = **yergason's test** - they flex to 90 degrees , with forearm pronated, externally rotating while supenating, turning out while external rotation 
6. injury to the long thoracic nerve 
	1. innervation of serratus anterior disrupted, so winged sacpula occurs
	2. paralysis of serratus anterior, 
	3. happens with blow to the lateral thoracic wall 
7. upper BP injury ==C5-6== - can happen due to prolonged birth where head is pulled away from shoulder at one side, 
	1. supplies ==nerves to the shoulders, which will droop on that side.== no bicep flexion, thrown hand 
	2. "Erb duchenne palsy" 
8. lower BP injury - when kid falls off cliff but hangs on to a branch, ==C8/T1 affected==
	1. ==ulnar nerve== majorly impacted, bc you get ==claw hand==, which means intrinsic muslces and forearms highly limited 
9. brachial plexus + peripheral nerve injury 
	1. radial nerve impacted, then everything downstream 
	2. shatter on groove of humerus - think of which branches are before that are still intact 
	3. lesion at elbow, think olecranon broken, brachioradilais muscle impacted 
10. compartment syndrome - where strong fascia can have a problem bc when compartment is injured, blood fills inside, making things high pressure
	1.  soft tissue injury -> edema
	- antebrahial fascia 
	- compression of vessels + nerves
	- pain
	- paresthesia,  - numbness/altered sensory 
	- pressure- measureable 
	- pallor/poikilothermia - paleness + loss of temp 
	- paresis = paralysis of that nerve 
	- pulse loss = bc bloods not moving 
	- basically irreversible dmg after 4+ hrs
11. "trigger finger" = any tendon that will arch over the phalanges has a synovial sheath . cyst can occur with infection like tenosynoviits
	have to forciblely push that finger to resist the cyst, 
	- this pops the cyst with a click, so **distal movement of flexor tendon temporarily stopped during extension**

lower limb path
4. compartment syndrome
	- very high risk in nondistendable tight fascia like crural fascia, where it's super strong in the leg. 
	- 6 Ps of this: Pain, Pallor (paleness), Paresthesia (numbness/tingling), Paralysis, Pulselessness, and Poikilothermia (abnormal temperature, often coolness) 
5. varicose veins 
	- with incompetent valves, they can't push the blood flow to heart well, making them swell and bulge with flow reversal
	- many superficial veins will distend, and these superficial veins will connect to the deep veins so that wont't work 
6. positive trendelenburg's sign
	- decr strength oof gluteus medius + minimus due to trauma/dz on one side = "dropped pelvis"
	- therefore dmg to the superior gluteal nns 
7. piriformis syndrome
	- can happen as a result of early division too above the piriformis bc it can be squished by this 
	- pain in butt, seen in 15-20% of population where the sciatic nerve crosses below the piriformis, but the muscle splits .... so it presses on your sciatic nerve 
	- pain down posterior leg 
	- foot orthotic, biomech issue, examine sacroiliac joint/hip joint, typially mssage , ice
8. sacroiliac joint dysfunction
	- - excessive movement in the joint, maybe trauma caused. 
	- can eventually lead to piriformis syndrom as a degenerative arthritis 
	- pregnancy can see this 
	- pain in lower back, back of hips + lessor exent groin+thigh
	- get them anti-inflammatories and physical therapy 
9. adductor longus ossificaiton = "riders strain"
10. fibular nerve injuries
	1. common fibular n injury = can't do extension (deep fibular nerve) => **footdrop** and can't flex the fooot either with the superfibular nerve
11. pes planus
	1. flat foot arch - dislocation of talus 
	2. overuse injury 
12. plantar fascitis 
	1. **pain due to inferior calcaneal nerve**
	2. rec with RICE
13. stress facutres - running + stroke or land improper 
14. achilles tendonitis - tught conv? 
15. turf toe = sprain of greate toe from football, resulting from **excessive upward bending/jamming**
16. heel spur = ca depo that makes things worse fr plantar fascia reactions 
17. morton's neuroma/intrmetatarsal neuroma 
	1. compressnerve like 3rd and 4th one between that time. 
	2. their shoes are too covered
18. lifrank/midfoot injury = bifurcate ligaments wher ppl go at eeath 
19. - - coxa valga = greater trocanter abnormally low, angle is more than 125 - inability to adduct 
		- greater trchanter abnormally ihgh = less than 125 degrees, coxa vara = inability to abduct 
20. prepatellar bursitis =  **housemaid's knee - friction bt skin + patella. fluid with inflamatory cells lead to swelling, spreads to other bursa very fast, like subq infrapatellar bursa + deep infrapetellar bursa too**
21. - anterior talofibular ligament = these are most often torn  = most often torn in the foot as a tendon 
22. trochanteric bursitis - bc the gluteus max will get bumped and then can spread this inflammation up commonly associated  = very persistent 
23. iliotibial band syndrome - with runining, etc continual rubbing of band over lat femoral epicondyle => inflammation 
24. unhappy triad
	- tackle made to lateral collateral portion 
	- anterior cruciate ligament
	- medial collateral ligament 
	- meniscus too 
	- lateral colalteral not impacted in spite of impact here, but the otehr side the medial collateral would open up 
25. - chondromalacia patella - runniers knee. kneecap pain , - due to kneecap rubbing against 1 side of knee joint + irritation 
26. high ankle sprain = - foot forced to rotate to outside, can be put in cast or screw can be put in if injury unstable to hold tibia + fibula in place... 

dz of peripheral nerve + muscle 
1. peripheral neuropathy... caused by diabetes, vitamin def, alc, drugs / supplements, toxins, heavy metals, vasculitis, amyloid, paraneoplastic, etc.... motor + sensory: slow progression + symmetrical mostly with stocking/glove distrib - most common , some effect on **longest nerves of body first before other effects, which goes to fingers/toes first**
	1. loss of **deep tendon reflexes, lesion anywhere in reflex arc**
	2. dx
	- ==usually biopsy of **sural nerve, a sensory nerve but we get motor types of insertions**==
	- ==- **vasculitis = muscle biopsy useful
	- - granulomatous dz - very seldom impacts nerves, leprosy tho maybe 
	- - confirm inflammatory process - any time it's inflammatory, it's **patchy, you can miss it. so that's why u get the muscle biopsy**
2. wallerian degeneration of peripheral nerve - nerve dying back due to being severed or cut externally 
3. secondary demyelination - having myelin all disappear and more of being secondary, to a general event like nutrition or intoxication. 
	1. areas with secondary myelin degeneration has a dark circle filled, but no axon in the middle 
4. segmental demyelination = primary demyelination - where you get the bit of myelin hurt or injury to myelin sheath / loss **schwann cells wrap the myelins**
5. axonal degeneration - acutely has big thick myelin fibers, but already lost the small myelinated ones which are sensory autonomic mixture usually. 
	- you'll get more of the big thick axons again, but the myelin layers aren't that thick in comparison to the normal ones. basically thick axons but myelin thin in comparison 
6. diabetic nerve specifically shows loss of more small thinly myelinated/senosry fibers... so you also see thick-walled nerve and vessels!!
7. vasculitis - - basically occlusion of bv, fibrinoid necrosis, perivasc inflammation , polyarteritis, sle, etc... - *painful* **asymmetric mixed sensory (usually) + motor**
	1. we see **patchyness** too - so we have to biopsy **both peroneal nerve and muscle gastrocnemius** 
8. amyloid - mix of  **sensory + autonomic dysfunction**; start DISTALLY, then carpel tunnel type syndromes
	1. - disorders of peirpheral n are the most common with systemic amyloidosis 
	2. - **AL amyloidosis most common type of acquired amyloidosis polyneuropathy** = from plasma cells that make congo red stain apple green. 
	3. smudgey and gray/light bluish 
9. guillian barre syndrome GBS  - - acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy , rapidly prog, ascending motor issue, death by not breathing 
	1. happen in resp to vaccine or disease .
	2. **CSF has inc protein , but no inc in cellularity**
	3. no axons affected usually, **just demylinating**  
	4. - treat: supportive: autoimmune syndromes to get to the point where they start remodeling their myelins 
	- plasmapheresis 
	- immunoglobulins 
10. **chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy**  -  ***segmental demyelination,* inflammation of nerves with many mostly macrophages**- they are wiggling themselves into the myelin sheath and trying to unwrap the myelins 
	 - more common
	 - worsening **muscle weakness, more pain/sensory problems like numbness, loss of reflexes**
	- autoimmune + acquired
	- old men 
	- **slowly progressing long term symptomes**
	- **ONION BULBS**
	- - TREAT: steroids, IVIG, plasma ex, other immuontherapy 
11. hereditary sensory neuropathy 
	1. sensory symptoms: numbness, tingling, pain in feet/hands
12. hereditary motor neuropathy =  weakness/atrophy
13. hereditary sensory + autonomic neuro = 	- autonomic syndromes: **sweating, bp like postural hypotension, insensitivity to pain** 
14. hypertrophic neuropathy 
	1. **onion bulbs = redundant schwann cells around axons, in this type of *palpable* nerves** 
15. *neurogenic* = CNS/PNC issues... no pain, no muscle fasciculations, **enzymes normal but the EMG shows fib, angular atrophy + type grouping**
 16. **amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/lou gehrig dz = ALS** 
	 1. CNS dz for adults,=  distal weakness, **no pain, fasciculations, enzymes might be fairly normal**
	 2. EMG shows fibrillations (EMG form of fasciculations), sharp waves 
	 3. TREAT: ==some cases are genetic with SOD1 or C9orf72== ... but there's an **antisense oligonucleotide to stop some symptoms and slow down progression. not a cure**
17. spinal muscular atrophy in KIDS = weakness, tremors, dev developmental delays, contractures in joint, bone deformities 
	1. TREAT: insufficient survival motor neuron ==SMN protein due to loss of function gene==, so they use adeno-associated virus vector based therapy or some SMN2 directed antisense oligonucleotide 
18. LEMS/lambert eaton  = NMJ disease
	1. **small cell cancer surface antigens - small cell cancer of LUNG making things, paraneoplastic syndrome is common**
	2. 		- producing ==voltage gated Ca channel antibodies== , reacting with normal channels in nicotinic + muscarinic presynaptic nerve terminals
	- begins in large muscles, move to resp... 
	- weakness on exam disproportionally mild to symptomalogy 
	- **areflexic!!!!!**
19. - myasthenia gravis - ==**anti-acetylcholine receptor**/anti-muscle-specific tyr kinase antibody== being made 
	1. **small muscles tire easily, worse later in the day = droopy eyelids/ptosis, diplopia/blurry/double vision**, fatigue, facial changes as exam goes on, problems talking, etc, weakness in **fingers**
	2.  **thymus is abnormal with thymoma or hyperplasia
	3. - **EMG = progressive decrmeents in AP potentials** 
	4. TREAT: pyridostigmine, steroids, immunosuppressants 
myopathic dz =  suspect these if **weak + PAIN in upper arms, shoulders, thighs** - maybe a long hx or not progressive. most have **CK elevations** due to necrosis and dead myocytes... and huge is **degeneration/necrosis**
20. dermatomyosis - CK elevations, pink necrotic fibers, regeneration, and round atrophy , many biopsies seen here,
	1. painful rash, in fasE + joints , might see vasculitis
	2. associateion cancer 
	3. TREAT: steroids 
	4. - angular atrophic fibers are instead **around the periphery of the muscle fascicle = perifascicular atrophy**
21. inclusion body myositis - **distal upper extremities + quads, elevated CK, no steroids, RIMMED VAcuoles**
	1. more **distal upper extremity + quadriceps** = so wrist and hand issues not typical of other myopathies 
	2. little inflammation once they occur + **steroid unresponsive**
22. - immune mediated necrotizing - many fibers are necrotic so very high CK
	1. **proximal msucle weaknes,s more of the quads**
	2. association with Statins used to manage, look for ==anti-hmgcr or other anti-SRP==
	3. cancer + viral infections + dz possible. but rejecting steroids is huge or this peron 
23. T2 atropy =  groups of small angular fibers which are all type 2 
		- causes by **disuse, CT disease, PREDNISONE,** arthritis, uremia, pregnancy 
dystrophies -  **progressive, long hx, and elevated CK = fibrosis + hypertrophy**
24. endomysial fibrosis -  round atrophy being buried in collaggen. 
25. duchenne's - cataracts can be given, cardiac issues happen etc
		- **duchennes = most common = this is x-linked with dystrophin mutation** 
		- - enlarged calves, waddling gait, lumbar lordosis 
		- **dense fibers = dark glob seen, purple
		- 		- TREAT: exon skipping genetic therapies , changes it to a more becker's type of look.... - more usable muscle protein avaliable, but less than 1/4 patients potentiallly respond not a cure. 
26. becker-dystrophin stains - if the dystrophin stain's done for duchennes, it would be negative 
27. mitochondrial myopathy
	1. - **prox muscle weakness, EXERCISE intol, cramping and excretion of myoglobin in urine**
		- **ocular findings, neurologic symptomes, cardiomyopathy
		- impairment of ox phos on mt membrane
		- they have **RAGGED bLUE fibers = NADH subsarcolemmal aggregates**
28. metabolic myopathies - like enzyme deficiencies. these are  **cramps, exercise intol, helped by rest, and elevated CK, vacuoles too
	1. 	- storage diseases liek glycogen  dz = all have **fatigue + exercise intolerance, but get better with rest. cramping of muscles, <3 issues, to respiratory issues too**
	2. diet should be high in carbs 
	3. very common to see: vacuoles 
29. lipid myopathies - many types to ACQUIRE
	1. **can acquire with alc, HIV, and other drugs**
	2. diet should be me... 
	3.  **oil red O= huge red droplets, too much lipids in fibers** or image it with sudan black which is too much black in each fiber. 
	4.  DIET therapy - avoid prolonged fasting + excessive muscular effort - give rich in complex carbs + low in fat 
	5. **riboflavin + carnitine therapy** 
30. channelopathies
	1. - **episodic** + **fluctuating** nature of symptoms, exacerbation by environment and **freq autosomal dom inheritance**; stops ppl from going thru, **periodic weakness is hypokalemia** 
	- can be **sodium, cl, calcium, potassius
	- ==Andersen tawil syndrome - ATS = mutation in KCNJ2 which encodes kir2.1 K+ channel== 
31. myotonia = nondystrophic, muscles hard to relax post-contraction 
	1. mytonia congenital = ==AR/AD; ClCN1 mutation==
	2. paramyotonia congenita - see if they can let go after shaking hand, sodium channel genes 
	3. **sodium channel myotonia = cold sensitivity and pain**
32. Central core dz - congenital myopathes = mild, non-progressive weakness/pain
	1. **strabismus = eye misalignment/crossing** , **scoliosis, joint contractures**
	2. malignant hyperthermia!!!! = **ca regulation and channels of your body is shot, so when exposed to anaesthesia, ca skyrockets and makes a lot of heat, sustained muscle contractions and necrosis**
	3. NSAIDs 
33. nemaline rod myopathy - weakness
		- **face, neck, trunk, proximal extremities = weakness most severe here**
	- variable in severity and prog , associated scoliosis + joint contractures
	- pictures: **rods / red on the trichrome stain... but EM shows ENLARGED Z BANDS!!!!**
34. centronuclear myopathy 
	1. x linked myotubular = breathing + swallowing issues, osteopenia, weakness + droopy eyelids
			- ==mutation in mTM1 gene==
		- you don't hit that developmental milestone , **you still get a central nucelus in all your muscle fibers,** meaning they don't work that well
		- give: **adenoassociated virus AAV vector to give functional copy of mtm1**
	2. congenital fiber type disproprotion 
		1. small fibers = ATPase stain = many small type 1 fibers = leads to hypotonia, weakness, breathing difficulties
		2. Treat with just symptom management 

---
bone path
1. achondroplasia -  most common cause of skeletal dysplasia
	1. dwarfism, ==FGFR3 mutation== inhibits endochondral/long bone growth 
	2. inc with parental age de novo 
	3. thanatophoric dysplasia = lethal variant, frontal bossing, small chst, BELLSHAPED abdomen, short limbs, AD, fetal resp failure
2. osteogenesis imperfecta = common inherited CT dz, **"brittle bone disease"**
	1. autosomal dom, ==alpha1/alpha 2 *type 1 c*ollagen== 
	2. most common - ==mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2== AD -> decreased prod of structureally normal collagen 
	3. less common: **problem in ==hydroxylase enzyme== forming via hydrogen and di-sulfide bonds, we cannot make the triple helix of 3 collagen alpha chains.**
	4. suspect childabuse
	5. subtypes 1-4 
		1. mild, blue sclerae, freq fractures. **1A = without dentinogenesis imperfecta, and then 1B is WITH....** minimal deformity, hearing loss too, but normal cogniftive development. **we might see wormian bones = cracks in skull as the skull is formed.**
		2. most severe, perinatal lethality + severe bone deformity too - in utero you see fractures with callus formation, and intrauterine growth restriction. skull large for body size w/ wormian bones, 			- **dark blue sclerae, frog leg posture with short bowed limbs**, cause of death is usually pulm hypoplasia and rib fractures
		3. severe but non-lethal **progressive** : short, **dark sclerae**, de novo but sometimes AR, **DI common,** variable life expectancy but with **respiratory failure.**  
		4. moderate, bone deformities, **normal sclerae.** short stature, normal life 
	6. TREAT: *bisphosphonates, orthopedics early, mobility aids, monitor hearing + dental + pulm, get multidisciplinary care*
3. osteopetrosis - marble bone disease
	1. due to acidification of osteoclast resorption pit = reduced bone resorption and symmetrical skeletal sclerosis, so **osteoclast impairement**, can't resorb spongey bone properly , no space inside bone for blood making = anemia 
	2. erlenmeyer flask deformity = long bones are hard and stonelike but brittle bc they lack the medullary canal and are bubous/misshapen
	3. cranial nerve deficits, anemia, hydrocephalus and renal tubular acidosis
metabolic bone dz
4. rickets/osteomalacia
	1.  vitamin d deficiency, bones too soft
	2. osteomalacia in adults = constant undermineralized remodding = risk of fracture up
	3. rickets in peds = abnormal bone depo in growth plates
		1. harrison groove ((lateral grooves of ribs seen)) /rachitic rosary , pigeon breast deformiting
		2. bowing + frontal bossing
5. osteopenia/osteoporosis -**pay attention to the 1/3 score, total score for vertebrae, and the femoral neck/total** and pay attention to the worst of the scores too 
	- please test DXA IF:
		- ==65+ woman==
		- ==70+ man== 
		- ==women with hx of fragility fractures,== 
		- ==all postmenopausal women with 1 RF,== 
		- ==adults with dz or med hx associated with bone loss== 
	1. osteopenia dec bone mass, 1-2.5 sdevs below mean peak bone mass DXA; which is a method to get the bone mineral desnity , gold standard by measuring hip and spine. then getting the T score. 
		1. score is ==-1 to -2.5== 
		2. ==1+ is normal== 
	2. ==**on the other hand, the z-score = SD that the BMD is of an age, sex, and ethnicity matched reference**==
		1. more than -2.0 = normal bone mass for age
		2. ==<-2.0 = low bone mass for age.== which is a suggestion of 2ndary cause for osteoporosis 
	3. osteoporosis = more severe more than 2.5 stdevs below peak bone mass; silent dz until **fragility fracture (from standing height or less, NOT TRAUMA)** occurs. most common in vertebrae, hips, wrists
		1. ==score is <-2.5 for osteoporosis== 
	4. trabecular, spongelike bone gets turned over by more osteoclasts, making it thinner like in vertebrae. and cortical/compact bones which will get low turnover, like longbones still get lost by endocortical resorption and tunneling, inc porosity and making it more spongey. 
		1. trabecular bone score = TBS - texture indx.. 
		2. high TBS = strong fracture resistat microarchitecture
		3. low = weak 
		4. ==1.35+ normal TBS== 
	5. cause is senile(after your 50s, resorption is more than formation) or postmenopausal or due to hyperthyroidism, GI issue,s malnutrition, steroids etc. 
		1. rankl activation of osteoclasts 
		2.  inc resorption, dec bone mass, inc cortical porosity, trabecular disruption, reduced mineralization
		3. medications which cause this:  glucocorticoids(**rapid loss and at higher bone mineral desity than expected too**, osteoblast apoptosis and decrease in viability, dec in androgens, and then PTH inc, causing losss), heparin, thyroid supp, **aromatase inhib, depo-provera, seizure meds, ppi, ssris** = secondary osteoporosis 
	6.  clincally = vertebral compression fractures, lordosis/kyphoscoliosis, traumatic fractures
		1. hip fract = DVT mortality 
		2. vertebrae - height loss, kyphosis which turns into restrictive lung dz, pain, **predictor for future fractures**... 
		3. pain with sitting? vertebral pt tenderness, acute onset back pain, DX img, loss of height of **2 cm or reported loss of 4+ cm**
	7. treat; weight bearing and loading exercise with your body weight, ca/vita d, bisphosphonates(osteoclast activity is down, binds to your bone), denosumab (post-menopausal osteo, binds rankl) , zoledronic acid (prevent + treat glucocorticoid osteo), calcitonin (treat postmenopausal osteo but inc in malignancy)... or anabolic agents like PTH teriparatide (best for ppl with **multiple RFs for fracture , this is a 2nd line thing*)
		1. follow up the DXA every 6-23 mon , and document response on any treatment. success is when BMD is STABLE. 
		2. fracture risk = **FRAX - risk assessment tool, specific for calculating this to monitor**
			1. takes in account age, sex, weight, height etc... in addition to BMD to determine the risk . 
			2. biggest addition to the score = prior fracture 
		3. give drug holiday after 3-5 yrs of success in bisphosphonate therapy... then re-eval BMD every 1-2 years to look at risk 
6. hyperparathyroidism- too much PTH = osteoclast more, bone resorption more. 
	1. losss of serum ca feedback - 
	2. due to either tumor or secondary due to underlying renal dz, where ca and vita d decrese bc no conversion properly 
	3. brown tumors = not real tumors but microfracture reparative rxn which makes bloody mass (histiocytes, blood, fibrous tissue
	4. ==osteitis fibrosa cystica = cystic brown tumor in severe longstanding cases== 
nonneopastic bone dz 
7. pagets dz
	1. ==genetic SQSTM1 mutation, environmental, or viral==
	2. monostotic or polyostotic 
	3. leontiasis ossea , platybasia( invagination of skull base + posterior fossa compression)
	4. femoral/tibial anterior bowing -> osteoarthritis
	5. chalk like stick fractures; inc in alk phos, ca, but normal phosphate labs
	6. TREAT: calcitoin + bisphosphonates
	7. osteosarcoma risk up 
			1. ==lytic phases = osteoclast making thinner trabeculae with making resorption pits==
			2. mixed phase = ==osteoblast puts down new bones,== but instead of lamellar rearrangement like normal... ==we have mosaic cement line pattern = osteosclerotic phase== 
			3. 4th stage = quiescent - minimal osteoblast/clast acitivty 
8. fractures = loss of bone integrity due to injury / loss
	1. inhibits healing: deformity, inadequae mobilization, infecition, malnut, osteoporosis, etc. 
	2. nonunion. = think of it as a false joint, pseudoarthrosis might be made 
9. osteonecrosis - infarction/ischemic necrosis , cmmon in femoral head
	1. due to vasc injury, steroids, sicklle cell, radioation 
	2.  infarction of trabecular bone + marrow , cortex spared due to periosteum blood flow 
	3. subchondral = wedge shaped necrosis and collapse with cartilage sloughing off
10. osteomyelitis - common bone infection, hematogenous spr with kids, ulcers in adults with fracture, surg, diabetes. mainly s auereus, gbs/ecoli in kids, and salmonaella in sickle cell 
bone tumor
11. osteoma - skull, jaw, **facial bones**; head and neck
	1. associated = gardner syndrome (so many polyps in colon and rectum, inc risk of getting colorectal cancer, a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis FAP caused by the APC gene mutation)
	2. circumscribed as hell with mature lamellar cortical bone ; benign
12. osteoid osteoma -  appears in diaphysis of long bones, immature woven bones, relieved at nigt by nsaids, but localized night pain 
	1.  **radiolucent = central nidus, a white area, with a sclerotic ring reaction, which is more gray**
	2. TREAT: ablation 
13. osteoblastoma. - also benign, **mainly in vertebrae**
	1.  more on the ==metaphysis medulla rather than cortex==
	2. 	3. ==well-defined radiolucent lesion without sclerosis much, which is radiolucent bone== 
14. non-ossifying fibroma - non-bone forming fibrous tumor of the bone
	1. in kids 
	2. eccentric distal femur/proximal tibia metaphysis
	3.  **very thin rim of sclerosis/cortex, usually kids playing soccer then injured randomly, basically tumor's thin cortex popped
	4. storiform fibrosis, osteoclass, foamy macrophages of hemosidierin 
15. osteosarcoma - more malignant now, mainly in knee
	1. bimodal age
	2. presidsoion - ask your doctor if you have risk 
	3. painful enlarging mass +/-pathologic fracture
	4. **codman's triangle** = like a bite mark taken out of the bone on xray
	5. histo is **pink, lace-like osteoid production, pleomorphic, highly cellular and atypical mitoses** or sunburst appearance on the xray
16. ewing sarcoma - 
	1. diaphysis of long bones 
	2. ==EWSR1 translocation 22==
	3. destructive lytic tumor extending into soft tissue, shows a **onion skin tumor**
	4. small blue round cells +/- homr wright. 
17. metastatic - lesions
	1.  ==lytic lesions = hole, breast, renal, myeloma==
	2.  ==sclerotic/blastic = bone forming, **prostate**==
	3.  ==mixed too , not all straightforward
18. osteochondroma - bone, cartilage, benign
	1. kids to young adult
	2. cortical bone with overlying cap, treat with excision
19. chondroma/enchondroma - benign, young dult
20. enchondroma = from medullary, bony central small bones of hand/foot. 
	1. maffucci syndrome = many enchndromas + hemangiomas. 
	2. ollier dz =  90% of the cases with multiple enchondromas, preferencia for one side of body
	chondroma = speicifcally coming out of bone surface, humerus, hand/foot- cartilage can be coming out of bone surfaces, look at small circumscribed radio incision i saw... 
21. chondrosarcoma = only malignant one in adults
	1. radiolucent lesion with **calcification** or flocculent densities = usually th gray location - blown thru it and more necrotic
22. radial head subluxation- immature annular ligament to slip over head of radius and slide onto radiohumeral joint, not a funny moment
23. tibial tuberosity avulsion / asgoo--shcholatter dz = 
	1. overuse injury putting stress on tibial tubercle via repetitive contraction of quad muscles
	2. athelete thing 
	3. get an xray too 
24. palletofemoral pain syndrome PFPS- 
	1. oft tissue swelling; overuse disorder  and ignore disorder ... which jake approves. f
check kids with ortolani barlow maneuver
typically for hip dysplasia, the pavlic harness is givn to them. 
25. legg calve perthes disease= **avascular necrosis of femoral head**
	1. obese, insidious onset
	2. limited internal rotation + abduction f hip t
	3. trendelen burg gait 
	4. assymetrical subtle xrays 
26. slipped capital femoral epiphysis - non symmetric, looks like golf ball vs melted golf ball
	1. looks like epiphysis slips = lim and impaird rotatin ... makes fun of other country
27. axial force = causes buckle/torus fracture 
28. bending force = at an angle -> greenstick fracture an insecure immature one. 
29. ==salter harris = **fracture at the growth plate**==

physical injury 
- ecchymosis can contain contusion as a meaning. but more general 
- contusion = stays flat
- hematoma = is a space filling lesion with swelling skin 
1. deceleration injury -  an immediate stop, 	- ligamentum arteriosum will be tethering these organs as they move forward, then transcects. abrasions seen with seatbelt marks too 
2. angulated cuts on side of face from the tempered side windows 
3. - adults are hit below center o gravity  = flipped onto hood and then off = **head and neck truauma**
	1. common fatal H+N injury = atlanto-occipital separation , decapitation 
4. - kids hit above center of gravity = run over ) : 
5. burns = full thickness is 3-4th degree so **destroys dermal appendages so you need skin grafting** = white/charred + anesthetic bc nerve destroyed. 
	1. esp with 20% TBSA burns, you get edema, due to inc in local osmotic pressure + mediator induced vasc permeability... you get hypovolemic shock. 
	2. **fasciotomies** - where blood can't get to these areas down our bodies, whiteish part of ischemic necrosis 
	3. secondary burn infections - sepsis is leading cause of death with pseudomonas aeruginosa most common = we debride tho to the healthy tissue to stop as much cultures 
6. inhalation injury - delayed death , from breathing in water-souble gases = upper airway dmg and lipid soluble ones = deeper airways + pneumonitis 
7. CO poisoning - soot and black deposits in airways , but die more acutely 
8. heat stroke = **peripheral vasodilation with peripheral pooling of blood**, - red, hot dry skin (**no sweating**), throbbing , higher body temp
	1. blood shunted away from core, muscle necrosis, arrhythmias, DIC. 
9. heat cramps - - loss of electrolytes from sweating + cramps post-exercise 
10. heat exhaustion -  sudden onset collapse, - hypovolemia due to water depletion 
11. v-fib = cause of death via electricution injury, with a crater surrounded by white rim and then hyperremia. 
	1. burn with high energy,a nd you don't even have to make direct contact. 
	2. medullary center paralysis + extensive 
	3. in household AC... smaller injury+no burn, but **induction of muscle tetany, can't let go, resp paralysis, might yell and collapse**
	4. to go into v-fib you need ==100 miliamps....==
		1. amps = volts/ohms, and with dry skin, ohms are highr. wet skin , ohms drop 
---
path of joints 
arthritis/joint inflammation 
1. osteoarthritis- technically just a degenerative joint diseaese not inflammatory 
	1. articular catilage = **becomes** fibular
	2. in hips, knees, lumbar/cerv vertebrae, PIP,dip, mcp
	3. slow onsets, **worse w use, morning stiff, crepitus + ROM lims**
	4. TREAT: manage w NSAID/replacement/steroids 
	5. **chondrocytes prolif bc of less water...** then cleave type 2 collagen fibers from wear + tear. **we get soft and granular cartilage... which then we get cytokines + macrophage to try and compensate.**
		1. our body makes osteophytes in response, getting a ton of bone spurs + subchondreal cyst!!!
	6. we see erosion of that cartilage cap **+ loose bodies of fragments** 
2. rheumatoid arthritis - autoimmune t helper cell resp
	1. non-suppurative (no neutrophils) , proliferative and inflammatory synovitis, **destruction of artiular cartilage and then ankylosis or joint fusion
	2. polyarticular, symmetric, MCP+PIP, wrist, ankles, elbows, knees
	3. swollen warm painful, 3-5th decade women 
	4. skin nodules, CV and interstitial lung dz

	4. ligament attachment inflammation = ENTHESITIS 
	5. can progress to this from **reactive arthritis, from a disease or infections...** going into knee + dactylitis is coommon 
	6. dermatitis common too 
4. septic arthritis - 	- infectious, typically caused by bacteria 
	1.  kids = h flu, s. aureus, GBS, common is hematogenous spread
	- adults = gonococcus - like septic arthritis, etc. 
	- 	- **fever, leukocytosis, swelling/pain in joint**
	- monoarticular typically 
	- do joint asp , confirm dx + this spreads either by direct traumatic inoculation or hematogenous spread. very fast. 

crystalline arthropathies
1. gout whatever chronically we see  **bone erosion, loss of joint space, tophi which are rhematoid nodules similar**
	   	1. secondary cause =**meds like thiazides or conditions like tumor lysis syndrome + CKD**
	   	2.  crystals are **long slender PARALLEL, feathery and will see yellow when polarized and suspended in alc**

	5. seconary caused by hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism DM
	6.  ==**rhomboid blue in parallel crystals** in cartilage + meniscus, causing a phagocytic response and potential inflammation = purple calcified aggregates==
tumor like 
3. ganglion cyst - 
	1. 1-1.5 cm fluctuant mass near joint.... 
	2. cystic or myxoid degen - a hole which contains the synovial fluid material, but does not communicate with joint, like it's. a fibrous THIN CAPSULE full of synovial fluid, doesn't really have an epithelial lining so it's a **pseudocyst**
	3. surgically excise 
4. diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor 
	1.  shrub or sea anemonae
	2.  3-5 decade with large joint = knee
	3. pain, lim ROM + swelling 
	4. destructive + recurrent tumors.... synovium covered by  ==finger like projections and nodules that are pigmented wiht hemosiderin==
		1. pigment laden macrophages and the synovial surface is finger like projections on the side. , foamy macrophages,a nd epitheliod cells that are cancer cells
	5. caused by ==t(1;2) fusion of type VI colagen a-3 gene promoter with CSF1 = monocyte colony stimulating factor==
5. localized tenoxynovial giant cell tumor
	1. discrete and palpable nodule on **fingers attached to tendon sheath **
	2. tREAT: excision. =not as destructive or persistent as the other type 
	3.  ==t(1;2) fusion of type VI collagen with a-3 gene promoter with CSF. = **the same mutation**==
	4. , a small little marble instead of big glob with finger things, has most commonly giant cells.

soft tissue path 
recall that mesenchymal tumors would metastasis to lungs via bvs and not to lymph nodes. 
FNCLCC - grading system 
		- differentiation score 1-3 (like if it still looks like tissue of origin it's 1)
		- mitotic activity 1-3 
		- necrosis 0-2 
	- grade 1 = 2-3 total score
	- grade 2 = 4-5 score
	- grade 4 = 6-8 score 
smooth muscle
1. leiomyomas = fibroids, middle aged ppl in skin, deep cutaneous, uterus, retorperitoneum, viscera
	1. ==recall: **reed syndrome HLRCC - fumarate hydratase mutation**==
	2. surveillance or excise 
	3. ==grossly, whorled, circumscribed, and fascicles of smooth muscle cells in 90 degree angles - **perpendicular intersection, bland spindled and CIGAR SHAPED** with pointy/blunt end==
2. leiomyosarcoma 
	1. looks way diff, no bulging surface, is soft, hemorrhagic, and shows necrosis  
	2. will show **symptoms secondary to compression/invasion**, looks like leomyoma just with **necrosis, pleomorphisms**
skeletal msucle
3. rhabdomyoma 
	1.  head, neck, heart, and GU tract
	2. fetal type <2 yo, adult type in 30-80 yo

	4. pleomorphic - deep soft tissue, **lower extremity and in older ppl**
fat
5. lipoma - 5-7th decade, in trunk, prox extremities  
	1. intramuscular, parosteal (on top of bone), visceral
	2. painless, if you have multiple, look into  ==PTEN hamartoma syndrome, madelung dz==
	3. kids don't get this only adults, excise or observe it 
	4. looks like normal fat!! well circumscribed and completely white. 
		1. ==angiolipoma - more capillary lines and symptomatic painfulness with fibrin thrombi==
		2. ==pleomorphic lipoma - scattered  pleomorphic cells on the inside, not completely just fat.==
6. liposarcoma - 4-5 th decade
	1. **well-differentiated when inside our body's ==visceral== area- > retroperitoneum, paratesticular, mediastinum** = these get way bigger bc we dn't know it's growing until it presses on it!!
	2. atypical lipomatous tumor = tumor in our extremities instead 
		1. myxoid liposarcoma - **on deep extremity like inner thigh** = ==these pts have t(12;16) FUS-DDIT3, usually younger too== - blue-gray myxoid infiltrate, **gray cickenwire appearance as capillaries**
	3. has browning grossly with necrosis and hema
	4. - ==molecular = MDM2 amplification for diagnosese==
	5. ==dedifferentiated liposarcoma -  **basically it can just change into any soft tissue sarcoma... low or high grade dediff of only the well-diffeerentiated variety==
		1. you see the fat cells and a dedifferentiated weird component in the bgd 
fibrous tissue
7. nodular fasciitis - in YA< superifical location like subq or superficial trauma
	1. rapidly growign mass, sometimes a hx f trauma 
	2. ==USP6 rearrangement
	3.  plump spindle cells in **tissue culture pattern, swirly storibform , plump spindle forms without pleomorphism and RBC extravasation**!!! RBC poools into this 
		1. white parts have edema, but otherwise, it's just bland spindle cells. 
8. fibromatosis/desmoid tumors - young middle aged adults mostly men 
	1. extremities, retroperitoneum, abdomen, chest wall
	2.  fixed, painless mass - scary bc infiltraitive appearance + fixed on imging

CT disorders, might combine some with above 
1. osteogenesis imperfecta above
2. ehlers danlos syndrome - hyperflex + easy bruising
	1. classic types I+II ^^, along with **velvety hyperextensible skin with cigarette paper scarS**
		1. **type 5 collagen defect**- fibrillar, in skin and hair junctions 
		2. ==these have COL5A2 and COL5A2== AD
	2. type 3 = hypermobility type
		1. hypermbility joint pain and mitral valve prolapse and easy bruising  - **most common but least severe**
		2. joint instability and bc joints are just moving all the time, cause **chronic pain**
	 	3. type 4 = vascular type , 
		 	1. thin skin, visible veins, distinctive face... , rupture of large vessels/viscera
		 	2. **type 3 collagen, reticular collagen impacted**
		 	3.  ==COL3A and COL1A1, think of the 3 and <3 heart vascular focus. AD associated with arterial fragility with aneurysms and rupture ): ==
		 	4. high risk in pregnancy, need to do genetic testing to rule this out 
	4. genetic testing - rec if any major or minor criteria present... several minors criteria esp in pts less than 40 y/o 
	5.  beighton scoring system - measure joint hypermobility - this is huge for seeing hyperextension  - doens't necssarily mean EDS, but just hypermobility 
3. marfan's 
	1. tall, scoliosis, costochondral concave wall of chest - loss of straight form, putting stress on ankle joints
	2. concerns w blood vessels; **aortic dilation + dissection
	3. distinguishing point can be **intraocular lens SUPERIOR and TEMPORAL dislocation + ocular hypertension and flat feet**
	4. caused by **==fibrillin-1 FBN1 defects, which is huge in microfibrils of the ECM, supposed to make a scaffolding to make elastic fibers.**
	5. the fibrillin-1 is in **aorta, ligaments, ciliary zonules of lens, skin** hence the symptoms. 
	6. differential would be homocystinuria, which can also make ectopia lentis, but this is inferior lens dislocation. and also intellectual disability 
	7. other sign of marfans = wrist + thumb sign. 
	8. TEST: ==revisted ghent criteria + genetic testing of FBN1 for risk stratification + confirm dx== if there are features but not fam hx  + to set off cascade testing in family members 
	9. **MASS phenotyp**e = myopia, mitral valve prolaspe, borderline + prog aortic enlargment **but this is with nonspecific skin/skeletal feat**- all the BV effects but not the most specific skin and skeletal stuff = the aortic aneurysm an just happen on its own. 
4. loey-dietz syndrome - mutations in ==TGF-beta receptor or SMAD3== .... AD
	1. **arterial aneurysms** with **smaller sizes rupture**, arterior tortuosity . 
	2.  **bifid uvula / cleft palate**
	3. similar to marfan's also has long limbs, pectus, scoliosis, translucent velvety easily bruised skin 
	4. lens dislocation is uncommon though. 
5. Menkes disease  = poor collagen formation, after exocytosis, the collagen fibril tries to crosslink hydroxylysines but can't bc copper is required as a cofactor!!!! very end step
	1.  **x-linked defect in ==copper transport ATP7a, leading to bad crosslinking==**
	2. brittle hair, growth failure, neurodegeneration
6. alports syndrome  - (hereditary nephritis, deafness, ocular disturbance), kidney, ear, and eye issues
	1. basement membrane in kidney, ear, eyes, skin are all disrupted - **type 4 collagen is stopped.**
	2. **goodpastures syndrome makes antibodies to these glomerular capillaries.**

clinical LBP red flags
review this slide!
- trauma
- unexplained weight loss 
- age 50+ 
- fever/infection 
- immunosuppression like with IVDU and or steroid use too 
- ==syncope== 
- hx of cancr
- ==weakness/bowel or bladder dysfunction==
- pain at night/at rest
- pain lasting 1+ mon or not responsive to treatment 
signs on physical exam
- weird vitals
- motor weakness
- ==saddle anesthesia - numbness/tingling in groin area== 
- urinary retention 
- loss f rectal tone
- abnormal reflexes,
- ==pain on percussion of spinous processes== 
1. compression fracture - compression/coollapse of vertebral body , classified by percent height loss
	1. height loss, acutely - back pain sudden axial load!!! 
	2.  more insidious due to osteoporosis 
	3. xray dx
2. herniated disc -  **radiculopathy, radiating nerve pain**
	1.  like back and leg pain!!! numbness, tingling or weakness.
	2. most commonly bt l4/5 is the nerve L5 compression 
	3. between L5 and S1, usually S1 bc L5 already exited before the disc. 
	4. non-op bc the disc will resorb back.rough 6 weeks. only surg for significant weakness/cauda equina 
3. lumbar strain/sprain/mechanical LBP
	1. nonspecific no specific pathology 
	2. worse w movement, no tenderness over midline, etc. , no imging necessary, conservative treatment
4. spinal stenosis - narrowing of spinal canal/**vertebral foramen due to bony/soft tissue structures being degenerated**
	1. older ppl, no injury associated
	2.  vague low back pain, butt, leg pain, generally better **leaning forward as it opens that canal space.** ppl get relief leaning forward onto the *==grocery cart==* 
	3. neurogenic claudication - **thigh and leg pain worse with walking improves with rest.**
	4. ==MRI needed!!!==
5. spondylolysis/spondylolithesis - a continuum 
	1. getting spondylolysis and THEN getting spondylolisthesis
	2.  spondylolysis = **fracture of pars interarticularis**
	3. spondylolithesis = progression to **slippage and sliding** of one vertebral body anterior to the adjacent one below it!!! slipping forward. this is **most common in pars of L5 and anterolisthesis of L5 relative to s1
	4.  ==**low back pain in adolescent or older kid==, overuse injury mainly in extensive excercises. 
	5. Xray is go-**to scotty dog sign**, oblique view, CT, MRI 
6. cauda equina syndrome - look into treatment specifically, not quite important for the rest 
	1. severe compression of **nerve roots in thecal sac of lumbar spine... most commonly due to *acute lumbar disc herniation**
	2. sudden pain, worse than the ones they usually have
	3. acute back + leg pain with ==saddle paresthesias==
	4. ==**bowel + urinary retention/overflow incontinence... and bowel dysfunction / fecal incontinence
	5.  early dx is critical with mri is confirm is huge**==
	6. ==TREAT: urgent surgical dcompression to open that space up in 24 hours to show the nerves==

neuro exam
- upper motor neuron signs - hyperreflexia, spasticity/inc tone, cortical cerebral, cranial n 
	- **upper motor neurons typically have an inhibitory role, so if these ar lost, the lower motor neurons will become too sensitive to signals**
	- examples are trauma + spinal issues and CNS problems 
- lower motor neuron - peripheral NS - hyporeflexia, hypotonia, fasciculations = quivering of muscles bc muscles keep getting excited from losing something. and atrophy
	- examples are ALS, tic paralysis, b12 def, guillian barre syndrome, acute inflammatry demyelinating polyneuropathy 

tremors(rhythmic and going around a central point)
- resting vs postural (while holding something up) tremor 
fasciculations(watch their back for a few min)
rate on 0-5 scale, where 5/5 is normal. , 0 is no movement, and so on. 

get a feel on tone = muscle tone move around joints 
- spasticity(if you go slow, u can move, but if you move faster, it locks; ==this localizes to cortical spinal tract, like stroke/trauma)== 
- rigidity = ==localizes to basal ganglia, like parkingsons)==

coordination - checks cerebellum - 
- basal ganglia and corticospinal tract

gait - 
1. hemiparetic - stroke, arm flexed but the one leg extended ): one side affected, spastic
2. spastic - scissors - stroke/spinal injury  - can't bend either leg, both legs are spastic instead of just one 
3. steppage - footdrop - step high or trip on ur own foot like a fibular n injury  
4. parkinsonian - stooped posture, small steps - shuffling steps
5. ataxic - off balance, cerebelllar/sensory 

romberg -  shouler width apart, stand with your eyes closed, raised arms- do you know where your joints are in space? -  think cerebellar if thre's difference
pronator drift - test of weakness 

reflexes
- brachioradialis C5-6
- biceps C5-6
- tricepsC7-8
- patellar L3-4
- achilles S1 
- plantar reflex - babinski - scratch their foot up, normal response is flexion, abnormal = exenstion 
	- mute = neuropathy 

**recall - pain/temp - small fiber nerves, impact diabetes/alc**

---
things you can find on diabetes
- necrobiosis lipoidica diabecticorum - NLD - on lower leg: skin atrophy, yellow coloration, prominent BVs 
	- due to microangiopathy + vasc changes
- eruptive xanthomas - red dots
-  acanthosis nigricans - dark velvety skin, due to insulin insensitivity, in creased places 
- - for type 2 diabetes - **start foot care upon diagnosis + annually **
- type 1 = **5 years AFTER diagnosis + annually thereafter**
mechanisms which disrupt - 
- diabetic peripheral neuropathy - insensate/without proper sensation feet 
- osteoarthropathy = deformed foot,  changes to sensation + proprioception lead to microtrauma "neuropathic walking pattern" -> eventually flat foot/charcot foot 
- peripheral vascular disease - poorly perfused, ulcers and calluses scraped, and cramping with activity 

2 types of diabetic neuropathies 
1. peripheral neuropathy ,  common one is mononeuropathy like carpal tunnel syndrome 
	1. NOT a demyelinating process, it's an axon injury process, but spares the motor neurons early in the process though. 
	2. sorbitol -> mt dmg, and AGEs lead to microvascular dysunction + axonal injury 
2. autonomic neuropathies - sympathetic denervation in many organs - 
	1. cardiac autonomic neuropathy associated with mortality , heart not responding bc sympathetic Nervous system disrupted, 
		initially dec heart rate variability , then **resting tachycardia!!!** 	
		==orthostatic hypotension caused by tis denervation and **decreased vasoconstriction**==
		and Gastropareisis due to this same deal.
