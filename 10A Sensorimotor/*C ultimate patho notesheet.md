#summary 
upper limb pathology
1. rotator cuff tears - most commonly the supraspinatus tear
	- more dmg at older age
	- shoulder instability, limt ROM, trouble elevating arm 
	- reduction in space for supraspinatus muscle, with more acromion peaking thru over time in older ppl 
2. herniations or protrusions of lubmar disc... 
	- L4-5 injuyry, L5 is irritated.... 
	- in C4-5 injuries, C5 compressed horizontally going out. 
	- in sacral ones L5-S1 = the **S1 sacral root is being punished**
3. Clinicians look for a break in the neck of the dog of an oblique view of the lumbar X-ray to indicate a fracture in the region of the pars interarticularis, which is specific for spondylolysis
4. biceps tendinitis = 
	1. - long head of biceps travelling thru intertubercular sulcus of humerus, this tendon is a common issue 0: 
	2. bicep tendon deep to the **transverse humeral ligament, so excessive repetitive movements get it inflamed**
5. rupture of long head of biceps brachii - tendon torn, **popeye defromity**
	1. - "displaced muscle, popeye demformity" = leads to distally displaced belly of biceps is loose and more near forearms
	2.  torn from attachment of the supraglenoid tubercle
	3. snap or pop 
	4. long head can be displaced from the intertubercular sulcus too. 
	5. - can test = **yergason's test** - they flex to 90 degrees , with forearm pronated, externally rotating while supenating, turning out while external rotation 
6. injury to the long thoracic nerve 
	1. innervation of serratus anterior disrupted, so winged sacpula occurs
	2. paralysis of serratus anterior, 
	3. happens with blow to the lateral thoracic wall 
7. upper BP injury ==C5-6== - can happen due to prolonged birth where head is pulled away from shoulder at one side, 
	1. supplies ==nerves to the shoulders, which will droop on that side.== no bicep flexion, thrown hand 
	2. "Erb duchenne palsy" 
8. lower BP injury - when kid falls off cliff but hangs on to a branch, ==C8/T1 affected==
	1. ==ulnar nerve== majorly impacted, bc you get ==claw hand==, which means intrinsic muslces and forearms highly limited 
9. brachial plexus + peripheral nerve injury 
	1. radial nerve impacted, then everything downstream 
	2. shatter on groove of humerus - think of which branches are before that are still intact 
	3. lesion at elbow, think olecranon broken, brachioradilais muscle impacted 
10. compartment syndrome - where strong fascia can have a problem bc when compartment is injured, blood fills inside, making things high pressure
	1.  soft tissue injury -> edema
	- antebrahial fascia 
	- compression of vessels + nerves
	- pain
	- paresthesia,  - numbness/altered sensory 
	- pressure- measureable 
	- pallor/poikilothermia - paleness + loss of temp 
	- paresis = paralysis of that nerve 
	- pulse loss = bc bloods not moving 
	- basically irreversible dmg after 4+ hrs
11. "trigger finger" = any tendon that will arch over the phalanges has a synovial sheath . cyst can occur with infection like tenosynoviits
	have to forciblely push that finger to resist the cyst, 
	- this pops the cyst with a click, so **distal movement of flexor tendon temporarily stopped during extension**

lower limb path
4. compartment syndrome
	- very high risk in nondistendable tight fascia like crural fascia, where it's super strong in the leg. 
	- 6 Ps of this: Pain, Pallor (paleness), Paresthesia (numbness/tingling), Paralysis, Pulselessness, and Poikilothermia (abnormal temperature, often coolness) 
5. varicose veins 
	- with incompetent valves, they can't push the blood flow to heart well, making them swell and bulge with flow reversal
	- many superficial veins will distend, and these superficial veins will connect to the deep veins so that wont't work 
6. positive trendelenburg's sign
	- decr strength oof gluteus medius + minimus due to trauma/dz on one side = "dropped pelvis"
	- therefore dmg to the superior gluteal nns 
7. piriformis syndrome
	- can happen as a result of early division too above the piriformis bc it can be squished by this 
	- pain in butt, seen in 15-20% of population where the sciatic nerve crosses below the piriformis, but the muscle splits .... so it presses on your sciatic nerve 
	- pain down posterior leg 
	- foot orthotic, biomech issue, examine sacroiliac joint/hip joint, typially mssage , ice
8. sacroiliac joint dysfunction
	- - excessive movement in the joint, maybe trauma caused. 
	- can eventually lead to piriformis syndrom as a degenerative arthritis 
	- pregnancy can see this 
	- pain in lower back, back of hips + lessor exent groin+thigh
	- get them anti-inflammatories and physical therapy 
9. adductor longus ossificaiton = "riders strain"
10. fibular nerve injuries
	1. common fibular n injury = can't do extension (deep fibular nerve) => **footdrop** and can't flex the fooot either with the superfibular nerve
11. pes planus
	1. flat foot arch - dislocation of talus 
	2. overuse injury 
12. plantar fascitis 
	1. **pain due to inferior calcaneal nerve**
	2. rec with RICE
13. stress facutres - running + stroke or land improper 
14. achilles tendonitis - tught conv? 
15. turf toe = sprain of greate toe from football, resulting from **excessive upward bending/jamming**
16. heel spur = ca depo that makes things worse fr plantar fascia reactions 
17. morton's neuroma/intrmetatarsal neuroma 
	1. compressnerve like 3rd and 4th one between that time. 
	2. their shoes are too covered
18. lifrank/midfoot injury = bifurcate ligaments wher ppl go at eeath 
19. - - coxa valga = greater trocanter abnormally low, angle is more than 125 - inability to adduct 
		- greater trchanter abnormally ihgh = less than 125 degrees, coxa vara = inability to abduct 
20. prepatellar bursitis =  **housemaid's knee - friction bt skin + patella. fluid with inflamatory cells lead to swelling, spreads to other bursa very fast, like subq infrapatellar bursa + deep infrapetellar bursa too**
21. - anterior talofibular ligament = these are most often torn  = most often torn in the foot as a tendon 
22. trochanteric bursitis - bc the gluteus max will get bumped and then can spread this inflammation up commonly associated  = very persistent 
23. iliotibial band syndrome - with runining, etc continual rubbing of band over lat femoral epicondyle => inflammation 
24. unhappy triad
	- tackle made to lateral collateral portion 
	- anterior cruciate ligament
	- medial collateral ligament 
	- meniscus too 
	- lateral colalteral not impacted in spite of impact here, but the otehr side the medial collateral would open up 
25. - chondromalacia patella - runniers knee. kneecap pain , - due to kneecap rubbing against 1 side of knee joint + irritation 
26. high ankle sprain = - foot forced to rotate to outside, can be put in cast or screw can be put in if injury unstable to hold tibia + fibula in place... 

dz of peripheral nerve + muscle 
1. peripheral neuropathy... caused by diabetes, vitamin def, alc, drugs / supplements, toxins, heavy metals, vasculitis, amyloid, paraneoplastic, etc.... motor + sensory: slow progression + symmetrical mostly with stocking/glove distrib - most common , some effect on **longest nerves of body first before other effects, which goes to fingers/toes first**
	1. loss of **deep tendon reflexes, lesion anywhere in reflex arc**
	2. dx
	- ==usually biopsy of **sural nerve, a sensory nerve but we get motor types of insertions**==
	- ==- **vasculitis = muscle biopsy useful
	- - granulomatous dz - very seldom impacts nerves, leprosy tho maybe 
	- - confirm inflammatory process - any time it's inflammatory, it's **patchy, you can miss it. so that's why u get the muscle biopsy**
2. wallerian degeneration of peripheral nerve - nerve dying back due to being severed or cut externally 
3. secondary demyelination - having myelin all disappear and more of being secondary, to a general event like nutrition or intoxication. 
	1. areas with secondary myelin degeneration has a dark circle filled, but no axon in the middle 
4. segmental demyelination = primary demyelination - where you get the bit of myelin hurt or injury to myelin sheath / loss **schwann cells wrap the myelins**
5. axonal degeneration - acutely has big thick myelin fibers, but already lost the small myelinated ones which are sensory autonomic mixture usually. 
	- you'll get more of the big thick axons again, but the myelin layers aren't that thick in comparison to the normal ones. basically thick axons but myelin thin in comparison 
6. diabetic nerve specifically shows loss of more small thinly myelinated/senosry fibers... so you also see thick-walled nerve and vessels!!
7. vasculitis - - basically occlusion of bv, fibrinoid necrosis, perivasc inflammation , polyarteritis, sle, etc... - *painful* **asymmetric mixed sensory (usually) + motor**
	1. we see **patchyness** too - so we have to biopsy **both peroneal nerve and muscle gastrocnemius** 
8. amyloid - mix of  **sensory + autonomic dysfunction**; start DISTALLY, then carpel tunnel type syndromes
	1. - disorders of peirpheral n are the most common with systemic amyloidosis 
	2. - **AL amyloidosis most common type of acquired amyloidosis polyneuropathy** = from plasma cells that make congo red stain apple green. 
	3. smudgey and gray/light bluish 
9. guillian barre syndrome GBS  - - acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy , rapidly prog, ascending motor issue, death by not breathing 
	1. happen in resp to vaccine or disease .
	2. **CSF has inc protein , but no inc in cellularity**
	3. no axons affected usually, **just demylinating**  
	4. - treat: supportive: autoimmune syndromes to get to the point where they start remodeling their myelins 
	- plasmapheresis 
	- immunoglobulins 
10. **chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy**  -  ***segmental demyelination,* inflammation of nerves with many mostly macrophages**- they are wiggling themselves into the myelin sheath and trying to unwrap the myelins 
	 - more common
	 - worsening **muscle weakness, more pain/sensory problems like numbness, loss of reflexes**
	- autoimmune + acquired
	- old men 
	- **slowly progressing long term symptomes**
	- **ONION BULBS**
	- - TREAT: steroids, IVIG, plasma ex, other immuontherapy 
11. hereditary sensory neuropathy 
	1. sensory symptoms: numbness, tingling, pain in feet/hands
12. hereditary motor neuropathy =  weakness/atrophy
13. hereditary sensory + autonomic neuro = 	- autonomic syndromes: **sweating, bp like postural hypotension, insensitivity to pain** 
14. hypertrophic neuropathy 
	1. **onion bulbs = redundant schwann cells around axons, in this type of *palpable* nerves** 
15. *neurogenic* = CNS/PNC issues... no pain, no muscle fasciculations, **enzymes normal but the EMG shows fib, angular atrophy + type grouping**
 16. **amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/lou gehrig dz = ALS** 
	 1. CNS dz for adults,=  distal weakness, **no pain, fasciculations, enzymes might be fairly normal**
	 2. EMG shows fibrillations (EMG form of fasciculations), sharp waves 
	 3. TREAT: ==some cases are genetic with SOD1 or C9orf72== ... but there's an **antisense oligonucleotide to stop some symptoms and slow down progression. not a cure**
17. spinal muscular atrophy in KIDS = weakness, tremors, dev developmental delays, contractures in joint, bone deformities 
	1. TREAT: insufficient survival motor neuron ==SMN protein due to loss of function gene==, so they use adeno-associated virus vector based therapy or some SMN2 directed antisense oligonucleotide 
18. LEMS/lambert eaton  = NMJ disease
	1. **small cell cancer surface antigens - small cell cancer of LUNG making things, paraneoplastic syndrome is common**
	2. 		- producing ==voltage gated Ca channel antibodies== , reacting with normal channels in nicotinic + muscarinic presynaptic nerve terminals
	- begins in large muscles, move to resp... 
	- weakness on exam disproportionally mild to symptomalogy 
	- **areflexic!!!!!**
19. - myasthenia gravis - ==**anti-acetylcholine receptor**/anti-muscle-specific tyr kinase antibody== being made 
	1. **small muscles tire easily, worse later in the day = droopy eyelids/ptosis, diplopia/blurry/double vision**, fatigue, facial changes as exam goes on, problems talking, etc, weakness in **fingers**
	2.  **thymus is abnormal with thymoma or hyperplasia
	3. - **EMG = progressive decrmeents in AP potentials** 
	4. TREAT: pyridostigmine, steroids, immunosuppressants 
myopathic dz =  suspect these if **weak + PAIN in upper arms, shoulders, thighs** - maybe a long hx or not progressive. most have **CK elevations** due to necrosis and dead myocytes... and huge is **degeneration/necrosis**
20. dermatomyosis - CK elevations, pink necrotic fibers, regeneration, and round atrophy , many biopsies seen here,
	1. painful rash, in fasE + joints , might see vasculitis
	2. associateion cancer 
	3. TREAT: steroids 
	4. - angular atrophic fibers are instead **around the periphery of the muscle fascicle = perifascicular atrophy**
21. inclusion body myositis - **distal upper extremities + quads, elevated CK, no steroids, RIMMED VAcuoles**
	1. more **distal upper extremity + quadriceps** = so wrist and hand issues not typical of other myopathies 
	2. little inflammation once they occur + **steroid unresponsive**
22. - immune mediated necrotizing - many fibers are necrotic so very high CK
	1. **proximal msucle weaknes,s more of the quads**
	2. association with Statins used to manage, look for ==anti-hmgcr or other anti-SRP==
	3. cancer + viral infections + dz possible. but rejecting steroids is huge or this peron 
23. T2 atropy =  groups of small angular fibers which are all type 2 
		- causes by **disuse, CT disease, PREDNISONE,** arthritis, uremia, pregnancy 
dystrophies -  **progressive, long hx, and elevated CK = fibrosis + hypertrophy**
24. endomysial fibrosis -  round atrophy being buried in collaggen. 
25. duchenne's - cataracts can be given, cardiac issues happen etc
		- **duchennes = most common = this is x-linked with dystrophin mutation** 
		- - enlarged calves, waddling gait, lumbar lordosis 
		- **dense fibers = dark glob seen, purple
		- 		- TREAT: exon skipping genetic therapies , changes it to a more becker's type of look.... - more usable muscle protein avaliable, but less than 1/4 patients potentiallly respond not a cure. 
26. becker-dystrophin stains - if the dystrophin stain's done for duchennes, it would be negative 
27. mitochondrial myopathy
	1. - **prox muscle weakness, EXERCISE intol, cramping and excretion of myoglobin in urine**
		- **ocular findings, neurologic symptomes, cardiomyopathy
		- impairment of ox phos on mt membrane
		- they have **RAGGED bLUE fibers = NADH subsarcolemmal aggregates**
28. metabolic myopathies - like enzyme deficiencies. these are  **cramps, exercise intol, helped by rest, and elevated CK, vacuoles too
	1. 	- storage diseases liek glycogen  dz = all have **fatigue + exercise intolerance, but get better with rest. cramping of muscles, <3 issues, to respiratory issues too**
	2. diet should be high in carbs 
	3. very common to see: vacuoles 
29. lipid myopathies - many types to ACQUIRE
	1. **can acquire with alc, HIV, and other drugs**
	2. diet should be me... 
	3.  **oil red O= huge red droplets, too much lipids in fibers** or image it with sudan black which is too much black in each fiber. 
	4.  DIET therapy - avoid prolonged fasting + excessive muscular effort - give rich in complex carbs + low in fat 
	5. **riboflavin + carnitine therapy** 
30. channelopathies
	1. - **episodic** + **fluctuating** nature of symptoms, exacerbation by environment and **freq autosomal dom inheritance**; stops ppl from going thru, **periodic weakness is hypokalemia** 
	- can be **sodium, cl, calcium, potassius
	- ==Andersen tawil syndrome - ATS = mutation in KCNJ2 which encodes kir2.1 K+ channel== 
31. myotonia = nondystrophic, muscles hard to relax post-contraction 
	1. mytonia congenital = ==AR/AD; ClCN1 mutation==
	2. paramyotonia congenita - see if they can let go after shaking hand, sodium channel genes 
	3. **sodium channel myotonia = cold sensitivity and pain**
32. Central core dz - congenital myopathes = mild, non-progressive weakness/pain
	1. **strabismus = eye misalignment/crossing** , **scoliosis, joint contractures**
	2. malignant hyperthermia!!!!
	3. NSAIDs 
33. nemaline rod myopathy - weakness
		- **face, neck, trunk, proximal extremities = weakness most severe here**
	- variable in severity and prog , associated scoliosis + joint contractures
	- pictures: **rods / red on the trichrome stain... but EM shows ENLARGED Z BANDS!!!!**
34. centronuclear myopathy 
	1. x linked myotubular = breathing + swallowing issues, osteopenia, weakness + droopy eyelids
			- ==mutation in mTM1 gene==
		- you don't hit that developmental milestone , **you still get a central nucelus in all your muscle fibers,** meaning they don't work that well
		- give: **adenoassociated virus AAV vector to give functional copy of mtm1**
	2. congenital fiber type disproprotion 
		1. small fibers = ATPase stain = many small type 1 fibers = leads to hypotonia, weakness, breathing difficulties
		2. Treat with just symptom management

bone path
1. achondroplasia -  most common cause of skeletal dysplasia
	1. dwarfism, ==FGFR3 mutation== inhibits endochondral/long bone growth 
	2. inc with parental age de novo 
	3. thanatophoric dysplasia = lethal variant, frontal bossing, small chst, BELLSHAPED abdomen, short limbs, AD, fetal resp failure
2. osteogenesis imperfecta = common inherited CT dz 
	1. autosomal dom, ==alpha1/alpha 2 type 1 collagen== 
	2. blue sclerae, sensorineural hearing loss, small teeth + extreme fragility in skeleton 
	3. suspect childabuse
3. osteopetrosis - marble bone disease
	1. due to acidification of osteoclast resorption pit = reduced bone resorption and symmetrical skeletal sclerosis, so **osteoclast impairement**, can't resorb spongey bone properly , no space inside bone for blood making = anemia 
	2. erlenmeyer flask deformity = long bones are hard and stonelike but brittle bc they lack the medullary canal and are bubous/misshapen
	3. cranial nerve deficits, anemia, hydrocephalus and renal tubular acidosis
metabolic bone dz
4. rickets/osteomalacia
	1.  vitamin d deficiency, bones too soft
	2. osteomalacia in adults = constant undermineralized remodding = risk of fracture up
	3. rickets in peds = abnormal bone depo in growth plates
		1. harrison groove ((lateral grooves of ribs seen)) /rachitic rosary , pigeon breast deformiting
		2. bowing + frontal bossing
5. osteopenia/osteoporosis -**pay attention to the 1/3 score, total score for vertebrae, and the femoral neck/total** and pay attention to the worst of the scores too 
	- please test DXA IF:
		- ==65+ woman==
		- ==70+ man== 
		- ==women with hx of fragility fractures,== 
		- ==all postmenopausal women with 1 RF,== 
		- ==adults with dz or med hx associated with bone loss== 
	1. osteopenia dec bone mass, 1-2.5 sdevs below mean peak bone mass DXA; which is a method to get the bone mineral desnity , gold standard by measuring hip and spine. then getting the T score. 
		1. score is ==-1 to -2.5== 
		2. ==1+ is normal== 
	2. ==**on the other hand, the z-score = SD that the BMD is of an age, sex, and ethnicity matched reference**==
		1. more than -2.0 = normal bone mass for age
		2. ==<-2.0 = low bone mass for age.== which is a suggestion of 2ndary cause for osteoporosis 
	3. osteoporosis = more severe more than 2.5 stdevs below peak bone mass; silent dz until **fragility fracture (from standing height or less, NOT TRAUMA)** occurs. most common in vertebrae, hips, wrists
		1. ==score is <-2.5 for osteoporosis== 
	4. trabecular, spongelike bone gets turned over by more osteoclasts, making it thinner like in vertebrae. and cortical/compact bones which will get low turnover, like longbones still get lost by endocortical resorption and tunneling, inc porosity and making it more spongey. 
		1. trabecular bone score = TBS - texture indx.. 
		2. high TBS = strong fracture resistat microarchitecture
		3. low = weak 
		4. ==1.35+ normal TBS== 
	5. cause is senile(after your 50s, resorption is more than formation) or postmenopausal or due to hyperthyroidism, GI issue,s malnutrition, steroids etc. 
		1. rankl activation of osteoclasts 
		2.  inc resorption, dec bone mass, inc cortical porosity, trabecular disruption, reduced mineralization
		3. medications which cause this:  glucocorticoids(**rapid loss and at higher bone mineral desity than expected too**, osteoblast apoptosis and decrease in viability, dec in androgens, and then PTH inc, causing losss), heparin, thyroid supp, **aromatase inhib, depo-provera, seizure meds, ppi, ssris** = secondary osteoporosis 
	6.  clincally = vertebral compression fractures, lordosis/kyphoscoliosis, traumatic fractures
		1. hip fract = DVT mortality 
		2. vertebrae - height loss, kyphosis which turns into restrictive lung dz, pain, **predictor for future fractures**... 
		3. pain with sitting? vertebral pt tenderness, acute onset back pain, DX img, loss of height of **2 cm or reported loss of 4+ cm**
	7. treat; weight bearing and loading exercise with your body weight, ca/vita d, bisphosphonates(osteoclast activity is down, binds to your bone), denosumab (post-menopausal osteo, binds rankl) , zoledronic acid (prevent + treat glucocorticoid osteo), calcitonin (treat postmenopausal osteo but inc in malignancy)... or anabolic agents like PTH teriparatide (best for ppl with **multiple RFs for fracture , this is a 2nd line thing*)
		1. follow up the DXA every 6-23 mon , and document response on any treatment. success is when BMD is STABLE. 
		2. fracture risk = **FRAX - risk assessment tool, specific for calculating this to monitor**
			1. takes in account age, sex, weight, height etc... in addition to BMD to determine the risk . 
			2. biggest addition to the score = prior fracture 
		3. give drug holiday after 3-5 yrs of success in bisphosphonate therapy... then re-eval BMD every 1-2 years to look at risk 
6. hyperparathyroidism- too much PTH = osteoclast more, bone resorption more. 
	1. losss of serum ca feedback - 
	2. due to either tumor or secondary due to underlying renal dz, where ca and vita d decrese bc no conversion properly 
	3. brown tumors = not real tumors but microfracture reparative rxn which makes bloody mass (histiocytes, blood, fibrous tissue
	4. ==osteitis fibrosa cystica = cystic brown tumor in severe longstanding cases== 
nonneopastic bone dz 
7. pagets dz
	1. ==genetic SQSTM1 mutation, environmental, or viral==
	2. monostotic or polyostotic 
	3. leontiasis ossea , platybasia( invagination of skull base + posterior fossa compression)
	4. femoral/tibial anterior bowing -> osteoarthritis
	5. chalk like stick fractures; inc in alk phos, ca, but normal phosphate labs
	6. TREAT: calcitoin + bisphosphonates
	7. osteosarcoma risk up 
			1. ==lytic phases = osteoclast making thinner trabeculae with making resorption pits==
			2. mixed phase = ==osteoblast puts down new bones,== but instead of lamellar rearrangement like normal... ==we have mosaic cement line pattern = osteosclerotic phase== 
			3. 4th stage = quiescent - minimal osteoblast/clast acitivty 
8. fractures = loss of bone integrity due to injury / loss
	1. inhibits healing: deformity, inadequae mobilization, infecition, malnut, osteoporosis, etc. 
	2. nonunion. = think of it as a false joint, pseudoarthrosis might be made 
9. osteonecrosis - infarction/ischemic necrosis , cmmon in femoral head
	1. due to vasc injury, steroids, sicklle cell, radioation 
	2.  infarction of trabecular bone + marrow , cortex spared due to periosteum blood flow 
	3. subchondral = wedge shaped necrosis and collapse with cartilage sloughing off
10. osteomyelitis - common bone infection, hematogenous spr with kids, ulcers in adults with fracture, surg, diabetes. mainly s auereus, gbs/ecoli in kids, and salmonaella in sickle cell 
bone tumor

	1. associated = gardner syndrome (so many polyps in colon and rectum, inc risk of getting colorectal cancer, a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis FAP caused by the APC gene mutation)
	2. circumscribed as hell with mature lamellar cortical bone ; benign
12. osteoid osteoma -  appears in diaphysis of long bones, immature woven bones, relieved at nigt by nsaids, but localized night pain 
	1.  **radiolucent = central nidus, a white area, with a sclerotic ring reaction, which is more gray**
	2. TREAT: ablation 
13. osteoblastoma. - also benign, **mainly in vertebrae**
	1.  more on the ==metaphysis medulla rather than cortex==
	2. 	3. ==well-defined radiolucent lesion without sclerosis much, which is radiolucent bone== 
14. non-ossifying fibroma - non-bone forming fibrous tumor of the bone
	1. in kids 
	2. eccentric distal femur/proximal tibia metaphysis
	3.  **very thin rim of sclerosis/cortex, usually kids playing soccer then injured randomly, basically tumor's thin cortex popped
	4. storiform fibrosis, osteoclass, foamy macrophages of hemosidierin 
15. osteosarcoma - more malignant now, mainly in knee
	1. bimodal age
	2. presidsoion - ask your doctor if you have risk 
	3. painful enlarging mass +/-pathologic fracture
	4. **codman's triangle** = like a bite mark taken out of the bone on xray

18. osteochondroma - bone, cartilage, benign
	1. kids to young adult
	2. cortical bone with overlying cap, treat with excision
19. chondroma/enchondroma - benign, young dult
20. enchondroma = from medullary, bony central small bones of hand/foot. 
	1. maffucci syndrome = many enchndromas + hemangiomas. 
	2. ollier dz =  90% of the cases with multiple enchondromas, preferencia for one side of body
	chondroma = speicifcally coming out of bone surface, humerus, hand/foot- cartilage can be coming out of bone surfaces, look at small circumscribed radio incision i saw... 
21. chondrosarcoma = only malignant one in adults
	1. radiolucent lesion with **calcification** or flocculent densities = usually th gray location - blown thru it and more necrotic
22. radial head subluxation- immature annular ligament to slip over head of radius and slide onto radiohumeral joint, not a funny moment
23. tibial tuberosity avulsion / asgoo--shcholatter dz = 
	1. overuse injury putting stress on tibial tubercle via repetitive contraction of quad muscles
	2. athelete thing 
	3. get an xray too

27. axial force = causes buckle/torus fracture 
28. bending force = at an angle -> greenstick fracture an insecure immature one. 
29. ==salter harris = **fracture at the growth plate**==
---
physical injury 
- ecchymosis can contain contusion as a meaning. but more general
