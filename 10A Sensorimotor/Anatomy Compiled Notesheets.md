5 - 8 pgs
17 - 18 



8/26
Flexor Forearm; Cubital Fossa; Extensor Forearm; Dorsal Hand
COTEACH: 9/2, learn Palmar hand; finish upper limb dissections
Prosection/demo: Joints of the upper limb
- dissect one side of cadaver
- make shallow incisions on lat/med sides of arm from where the previous dissection eneded to 2-3 in below cubital fossa + elbow 
- make horizontal incision connecting the medial/ lateral incisions then remove skin 
- immediately locate : cephalic, basilic, v and cutaneous nerves 
	- review course of medial/lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves prior 
- use tweezers to lift brachial fascia off muscles + use scissors to make a longitudinal incision 
- blunt dissect to sparate from the underlying muscles + septa (medial + lateral)
- discard of tissue - ignore the cutting of biceps 
- working distal to proximal, trace tendons up to belly while separating them blunt dissection + separate long/short heads of biceps 
- clean coracobrachialis muscle (pierced by musculocutaneous n) without disrupting musculocutaneous n or any cutaneous branches 
- clean brachialis muscle, which would be under the long head of the biceps 
	- the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve will run on it 
- recall: cubital fossa bounded by antebrachial fascial and bicipital aponeurosis superficially 
	- review medial, lateral and superior and deep boundaries of cubital fossa
- id bicipital aponeuroses and separate with prube 
- cut the bicipital aponeurosis (where the biceps insert into the elbow region) as far distally as possible and reflect laterally 
- reflect pronator teres - using probe deep to muscle to separate from nerves... use scissors to transect at midpoint - careful don't dmg radial arteries or anything deep to it 
- reflect it 
- follow course of musculocutaneous, median ,and ulnar nerves from brachial plexus all the way down ... 
	- locate lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve emerging out the brachialis, comign off musculocutaneous 
	- continue tracing the medial antebrachial cutaneous n from previously 
	- follow brachial artery into cubital fossa, where it bisects into radial/ulnar arteries 
		- from the ulnar artery - common interosseous artery might come from here. 
	- major collagteral branches of brachial artery? (typically small and deep to musculature)
		- superior ulnar collateral a 
		- inferior ulnar collatral a 
		- radial recurrent a 
flexor compartment 
- remove skin of anterior surface of forearm 
- shallow incisions ending at the wrist 
- cut down to the wrist ??? 
- tweeser to get antebrachial fascia off muscles + scissors 
- work from dital to proximal, trace tendons of muscles up to the bellies while separating them with blunt dissection 
- clean and isolate: 
	- pronator teres - reflected in prev lab and cleaned
	- flexor carpi radialis - immediately medial to radial artery and insert into bases of 2nd and 3rd metacarpals 
	- palmaris longus m - 
	- flexor carpi ulnaris m - medial to the ulnar a + n, inserting at the pisiform bone and base of 5th metacarpal  
- then the intermediate layer
	- flexor digitorum superficialis m - 4 teendons thru carpal tunnel to insert on the middle phalanges 2-5 
		- 3+4 tendons are more superfiicial 
		- sandwiched between median nerve medially + ulnar a+n laterally 
- then the deep layer 
	- flexor digitorum profundus - immediately deep to digitorum superficialis, will go thru carpal tunnel + insert into 2-5 
	- flexor pollicis longus -  
	- pronator quadratus -  
- don't reflect any msucls actually , one side superficial, one side is deep. ? 
- id + clean: radial a + branches
	- radial recurrent a 
	- superficial palmar br of radial a  - careful as u dissect. + look for it at wrist 
- id + clean ulanar a 
	- ulnar recurrent a 
	- common interosseuous a (posterior and anterior later)
- id and clean median nerve - at wrist, medial to the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum superficialis - 
	- ant interosseous n - travels along the anterir interosseus a between flexor pollicis longus and digitalis profundus muscle 
	- palmar cutaneous br of median n - careful at wrist - 
- id and clean ulnar nerve as it continues - travels posterior to medial epicondyle and in forearm deep to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. , accompanied by ulnar a 

- note all dorsal structures are very thin and delicate 
- tweezers etc to remove all skin - make transverse incision along interphalangeal joint of thumb + one along metaarpophalangeal joints of digits. 
- then remove the remaining skin of posterior surface of forearm 
- don't remove skin from posterior surface of digits 
- separate and clean 
	- brachioradialis 
	- extensor carpi radialis longus 
	- extensor carpi radialis brevis
	- extensor digitorum 
	- extensor digiti minimi 
	- extensor carpi ulnaris 
	- isolate and clean aconeus m 
- isolate and clean lateral antebrachial cutaneous n 
- ID dorsla cutaneous br of ulnar nerve 
- superficial br of radial nerve on dorsum of hand? 
- id extensor retinaculum with attachments
- insert probe deep into it proximal to distal and use scalpel to transect superficial to it 
- id 6 osteofibrous canals lined with synovial sheaths that transmit the long tendons to hand 
- deeper layer of exnsor muscles
	- supinator
	- abductor pollicis longus 
	- extensor pollicis brevis
	- extensor pollicis longus 
	- extensor indicis 
- follow the posterior interosseus n+a bc they emerge from supinator 


9/3
Gluteal Region; Posterior Thigh; Popliteal Fossa
don't cut the sacrotuberous ligament 
place blocks under foot, ankle, knee
1. vertical incision from the previous median sacral crest cut , spare the anus + go along medial aspect of gluteal region ending 2-3 in down medial aspect of thigh 
2. vertical incision along lateral aspect of hip + thigh from previous midaxillary cut = go to halfway down thigh 
3. horizontal incisions from inf point of the cut to inferior pt of the other cut ... connect them 
4. continue both medial + lat incisions to just superior to the popliteal fossa - careful about cutaneous nerves 
5. horizontal incision connecting those points - careful of posterior femoral cutaneous n 
6. blunt dissect and skin removal!!!
7. start at the inf aspect of medial border of gluteus maximus - use **scissors to detach** muscle from gluteal aponeurosis without cutting sacrotuberous ligament
8. continue incision superior + laterally while LATERALLY reflecting the muscle 
	1. note = inferior gluteal vessels + nerve traveling thru belly 
9. cut the superior gluteal vessels as close to muscle as possible while keeping muscle intact 
10. follow incision pattern from superior to lateral to fully reflect down ... 
11. keep other gluteal vessels + nerves intact 
12. reflect the gluteus medius down and laterally from the proximal attachment 
	1. view the superior gluteal arteries and nerves that i
13. reflect gluteus max 
14. separate + clean muscles 
15. locate
