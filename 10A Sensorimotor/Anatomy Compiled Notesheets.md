Prosection/demo: Joints of the upper limb
- dissect one side of cadaver
- make shallow incisions on lat/med sides of arm from where the previous dissection eneded to 2-3 in below cubital fossa + elbow 
- make horizontal incision connecting the medial/ lateral incisions then remove skin 
- immediately locate : cephalic, basilic, v and cutaneous nerves 
	- review course of medial/lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves prior 
- use tweezers to lift brachial fascia off muscles + use scissors to make a longitudinal incision 
- blunt dissect to sparate from the underlying muscles + septa (medial + lateral)
- discard of tissue - ignore the cutting of biceps 
- working distal to proximal, trace tendons up to belly while separating them blunt dissection + separate long/short heads of biceps 
- clean coracobrachialis muscle (pierced by musculocutaneous n) without disrupting musculocutaneous n or any cutaneous branches 
- clean brachialis muscle, which would be under the long head of the biceps 
	- the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve will run on it 
- recall: cubital fossa bounded by antebrachial fascial and bicipital aponeurosis superficially 
	- review medial, lateral and superior and deep boundaries of cubital fossa
- id bicipital aponeuroses and separate with prube 
- cut the bicipital aponeurosis (where the biceps insert into the elbow region) as far distally as possible and reflect laterally 
- reflect pronator teres - using probe deep to muscle to separate from nerves... use scissors to transect at midpoint - careful don't dmg radial arteries or anything deep to it 
- reflect it 
- follow course of musculocutaneous, median ,and ulnar nerves from brachial plexus all the way down ... 
	- locate lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve emerging out the brachialis, comign off musculocutaneous 
	- continue tracing the medial antebrachial cutaneous n from previously 
	- follow brachial artery into cubital fossa, where it bisects into radial/ulnar arteries 
		- from the ulnar artery - common interosseous artery might come from here. 
	- major collagteral branches of brachial artery? (typically small and deep to musculature)

- then the intermediate layer
	- flexor digitorum superficialis m - 4 teendons thru carpal tunnel to insert on the middle phalanges 2-5 
		- 3+4 tendons are more superfiicial 
		- sandwiched between median nerve medially + ulnar a+n laterally 
- then the deep layer 
	- flexor digitorum profundus - immediately deep to digitorum superficialis, will go thru carpal tunnel + insert into 2-5 
	- flexor pollicis longus -  
	- pronator quadratus -  
- don't reflect any msucls actually , one side superficial, one side is deep. ?

	- superficial palmar br of radial a  - careful as u dissect. + look for it at wrist 
- id + clean ulanar a 
	- ulnar recurrent a 
	- common interosseuous a (posterior and anterior later)
- id and clean median nerve - at wrist, medial to the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum superficialis - 
	- ant interosseous n - travels along the anterir interosseus a between flexor pollicis longus and digitalis profundus muscle 
	- palmar cutaneous br of median n - careful at wrist - 
- id and clean ulnar nerve as it continues - travels posterior to medial epicondyle and in forearm deep to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. , accompanied by ulnar a 

- note all dorsal structures are very thin and delicate 
- tweezers etc to remove all skin - make transverse incision along interphalangeal joint of thumb + one along metaarpophalangeal joints of digits. 
- then remove the remaining skin of posterior surface of forearm 
- don't remove skin from posterior surface of digits 
- separate and clean 
	- brachioradialis

	- extensor carpi radialis brevis
	- extensor digitorum 
	- extensor digiti minimi 
	- extensor carpi ulnaris 
	- isolate and clean aconeus m 
- isolate and clean lateral antebrachial cutaneous n 
- ID dorsla cutaneous br of ulnar nerve 
- superficial br of radial nerve on dorsum of hand? 
- id extensor retinaculum with attachments
- insert probe deep into it proximal to distal and use scalpel to transect superficial to it 
- id 6 osteofibrous canals lined with synovial sheaths that transmit the long tendons to hand 
- deeper layer of exnsor muscles
	- supinator
	- abductor pollicis longus 
	- extensor pollicis brevis
	- extensor pollicis longus 
	- extensor indicis 
- follow the posterior interosseus n+a bc they emerge from supinator

20. free tibial nerve from CT and follow it inferiorly as it passes DEEP to the gastrocnemius + plantaris muscles at inferior apex of fossa
21. deep to tibial nerve that's funning thru middle of fossa = popliteal a + v within sheath of CT - open this and clean the artery + vein 
22. id - small saphenous vein following that popliteal v connection
