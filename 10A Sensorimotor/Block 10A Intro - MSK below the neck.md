mindset - much of the info from block 10-12 gets integrated + builds upon each other. 
final block 10 grade = 10A + 10B points combined 
10B = more of CNS sensorimotor systems 
- 10A = 3 tbls, some anatomy TBLS; anatomy too ; 60 points 
- 10B = we have a brain lab practical + written exam ... neuro tbl 
	- OSCE at beginning 

changes made = inclusion of IA 8 AM (bc it's 3 wks or longer)
content changes ; OSCE moved to 10B as well as neuromuscular diseases
FPC panel - caring for ppl living with disabilities is mandatory panel+module now 
new msk exam and neuro videos 
expand disease of peripheral nerves! 

10A - have muscle physiology + neuromsk, bone 
- Neuromuscular junction huge 
- med imaging is core here.

start on new cadaver, passing down dissections. "pass-off labs" = we **need to complete our disseciton before the next group gets in there, so we have time to review.**
coteach = very important we complete it. 
lab open except for 8-12 pm on tuesday mornings. 

superficial dissection on one side, deep dissection on the opposite side.
