![[Diabetes Foot Exam and Neuropathies AUG Kern 2025 (1).pdf]]

huge cost in non-traumatic lower extremity amputations - 
2x diabetes related hospitalizations, an entirely preventable complication - disproportionate effects to vulnerable populations. 

get a sense of their social context - talk abt their societal issues
- get info about food insecurity, one of the biggest things, financial barriers, health insurance and access, environment, 
- b level. - all other SDOH
- food insecurity is the biggest 
- biggest best outcome - provide ppl with additional self-managemnt support from lay health coaches, navigators, or community health workers 

ADA diabetes
ABCDDEEEF - 
- foot exam is annual, screen every visit for ulcers/infection = this is secondary prevention - 
- "always take off socks/shoes for me... so while we're talking about other things i can check your feet"
- how to blend this into patient care - lemme look at your feet. 
get patients to stop smoking!! they cannot heal if they keep smoking!!!
comprehensive foot exam: annual
- visual inspection - not every followup, but good for the student

3 mechanisms that disrupt function/structure of feet
- diabetic peripheral neuropathy - insensate/without proper sensation feet 
	- feels like foot was asleep. 
	- "you can injure yourself very badly if you can't feel pain - this is why it's dangerus"
- osteoarthropathy - deformed foot 
	- change in joint of architecture of foot 
- peripheral vascular dz - poorly perfused foot 
	- early tissue dmg -> clawing toes/callus/ulceration -> callus formation -> calluses scraped away, revealing serious ulcers. 

all cause ulceration -> infection -> amputation 

2 forms of diabetic neuropathies
1. peripheral neuropathy - 60% of all T2/T1 have this 
	- most commno: DPN , diabetic peripheral neuropathy , about 50% of neuropathies in diabetics. 
	- another common one is mononeuropathy like carpal tunnel syndrome 
2. autonomic neuropathies - sympathetic denervation in many organs - 
	- cardiac autonomic neuropathy associated with mortality 
	- sympathetic nervous system is disrupted, so your heart might be not responding .... 
	- initially dec heart rate variability , then **resting tachycardia!!!** 
	- orthostatic hypotension caused by tis denervation and **decreased vasoconstriction**
		- basically dec in systolic BP by 20+ and or in diastolic BP by 10+ , without an appropriate compensatory inc in HR. 
		- lie down 5 min, take bp, stand up, and be with them for 3 min , then recheck. 
	- also affect the GI tract, with GI neuropathies like gastroparesis is huge. do the gastric emptying test with scintigraphy of digestible solids at 15 min intervals for 4 hr after food intake. 

risk factors for DPN
- hyperglycemia
- smoking
- BMI - toxic adiposity 
- htn 
- secondary prevention - good glucose control, smoking cessation, BP control, etc. 
pathophys 
- PNS affected , like in the distal portions of the longest myelinatd/unmyelinated sensory axons... 
- DPN injuries nerves due to inury to sensory axons starting with the longest axons 
	- there's just more dmg to do with a huge long axon
	- NOT a demyelinating process, it's an axon injury process, 
	- **spares the motor axons early in the process though** 
1. excess glucose converted by aldose reductase to **sorbitol** -> mitochondrial dmg, dec NA/K+ ATP activity, depleting NADP, and making ROS, this will impair nerve function 
2. also this causes **advanced glycation end products and receptor bound AGEs , ROS, etc** - leads to *microvascular* dysfunction and axonal injury 

"stocking and glove distribution" = meaning distal to proximal sensory loss of feet before hands
differentials
- B12 def 
- alc neuropathy 
- hypothyroidism, renal,
