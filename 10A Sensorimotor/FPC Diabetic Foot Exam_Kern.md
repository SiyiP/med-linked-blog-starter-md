![[Diabetes Foot Exam and Neuropathies AUG Kern 2025 (1).pdf]]

huge cost in non-traumatic lower extremity amputations - 
2x diabetes related hospitalizations, an entirely preventable complication - disproportionate effects to vulnerable populations. 

get a sense of their social context - talk abt their societal issues
- get info about food insecurity, one of the biggest things, financial barriers, health insurance and access, environment, 
- b level. - all other SDOH
- food insecurity is the biggest 
- biggest best outcome - provide ppl with additional self-managemnt support from lay health coaches, navigators, or community health workers 

ADA diabetes
ABCDDEEEF - 
- foot exam is annual, screen every visit for ulcers/infection = this is secondary prevention - 
- "always take off socks/shoes for me... so while we're talking about other things i can check your feet"
- how to blend this into patient care - lemme look at your feet. 
get patients to stop smoking!! they cannot heal if they keep smoking!!!
comprehensive foot exam: annual
- visual inspection - not every followup, but good for the student
	- necrobiosis lipoidica diabecticorum - NLD - on lower leg: skin atrophy, yellow coloration, prominent BVs 
		- due to microangiopathy and vascular changes 
	- eruptive xanthomas - red dots
	- acanthosis nigricans - dark velvety skin, due to insulin insensitivity, in creased places 
- for type 2 diabetes - **start foot care upon diagnosis + annually **
- type 1 = **5 years AFTER diagnosis + annually thereafter**
1. inspect skin - look skin between toes; look inside their shoes too
2. assess for demormaties and function 
	1. plantarflexion 
	2. dorsiflexion of ankle + great toe 
	3. assess pulses ? DP/PT pulses - press lightly 
		1. dorsalis pedis, lateral to extensor hallucis longus tendon 
		2. posterior tibial, posterior and inf to medial malleolus 
	4. test sensation with 10-g monofilament test (large fiber function/protective sensation) - just apply it to any one of these, touch and see if it bends, and if they notice it when it bends in 5 spots **gold standard, pick just one below**
		1. ask them to close the eyes
		2. demonstrate on their hands, 
		3. test 5 areas of ventral surface of foot (palms of feet, big toe, and fourth toe)
		4. don't test over calluses 
	5. vibration sensory test with 128 hz tuning fork for large fiber function 
		1. strike it and place the stem on a bony surface of their wrist,,, and then to their big toe just proximal to nail bed. they'll tell yu when they can't feel anymore 
	6. pinprick sensory - small fiber function  - put to dorsal surface of hallux 
	7. ankle reflex - if you dorsiflex the foot to stretch tendon , and then see if you can hit the tendon... 
		1. know 0-4 , with absent is 0, normal is 2 and hyperreflexia with clonus is 4  

3 mechanisms that disrupt function/structure of feet
- diabetic peripheral neuropathy - insensate/without proper sensation feet 
	- feels like foot was asleep. 
	- "you can injure yourself very badly if you can't feel pain - this is why it's dangerus"
	- trauma goes undetected bc they don't feel pain appropriately, development of neuropathic walking patterns that lead to further injury 
- osteoarthropathy - deformed foot 
	- change in joint of architecture of foot 
	- changes to sensation + proprioception lead to microtrauma "neuropathic walking pattern"
	- **patients walk incorrectly -> flat foot**, or charcot foot. also you can get a rocker bottom foot with more collapse. 
- peripheral vascular dz - poorly perfused foot 
	- early tissue dmg -> clawing toes/callus/ulceration -> callus formation -> calluses scraped away, revealing serious ulcers. 
	- claudication - leg pain/cramping with **activity** due to poor perfusion of muscles 
	- skin cool to touch, thin shiny hairless skin of feet/legs, thick nails, ulcers, delayed healing 
why do infections happen so easily? hyperglycemia, bacteria loveeee sugars 
	also impaired white blood cell function too ): 

2 forms of diabetic neuropathies
1. peripheral neuropathy - 60% of all T2/T1 have this 
	- most commno: DPN , diabetic peripheral neuropathy , about 50% of neuropathies in diabetics. 
	- another common one is mononeuropathy like carpal tunnel syndrome 
2. autonomic neuropathies - sympathetic denervation in many organs - 
	- cardiac autonomic neuropathy associated with mortality 
	- sympathetic nervous system is disrupted, so your heart might be not responding .... 
	- initially dec heart rate variability , then **resting tachycardia!!!** 
	- orthostatic hypotension caused by tis denervation and **decreased vasoconstriction**
		- basically dec in systolic BP by 20+ and or in diastolic BP by 10+ , without an appropriate compensatory inc in HR. 
		- lie down 5 min, take bp, stand up, and be with them for 3 min , then recheck. 
	- also affect the GI tract, with GI neuropathies like gastroparesis is huge. do the gastric emptying test with scintigraphy of digestible solids at 15 min intervals for 4 hr after food intake. 

risk factors for DPN
- hyperglycemia
- smoking
- BMI - toxic adiposity 
- htn 
- secondary prevention - good glucose control, smoking cessation, BP control, etc. 
pathophys 
- PNS affected , like in the distal portions of the longest myelinatd/unmyelinated sensory axons... 
- DPN injuries nerves due to inury to sensory axons starting with the longest axons 
	- there's just more dmg to do with a huge long axon
	- NOT a demyelinating process, it's an axon injury process, 
	- **spares the motor axons early in the process though** 
1. excess glucose converted by aldose reductase to **sorbitol** -> mitochondrial dmg, dec NA/K+ ATP activity, depleting NADP, and making ROS, this will impair nerve function 
2. also this causes **advanced glycation end products and receptor bound AGEs , ROS, etc** - leads to *microvascular* dysfunction and axonal injury 

"stocking and glove distribution" = meaning distal to proximal sensory loss of feet before hands; symmetric too 
differentials
- B12 def 
- alc neuropathy 
- hypothyroidism, renal dz, malignancies, chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy 

signs vs symptoms
- symptom = subjective description , how they describe their dz 
	- pain with sharp jabbing 
	- toes are numb
- sign = objective, demonstrated on an exam, like diminished vibratory sensations, etc 

TREAT: good glucose + htn control +smoking cessation . some good things for treating pain 
- pregabalin, duloxtine 
- specially fitted shoes for the patient, helpful for them with ulcers/bony/soft tissue abnormalities, covered by insurance
- never go barefoot
- always check feet daily for sores/ulcers etc
- wear broad, flat shoes that fit properly 
- check shoes for foreign obj be4 putting in 
- trim nails straight not curved
- extreme caution when getting into tub water 
- feet dry and clean, dry between toes
- use lotion on legs/feet but not in between toes. 

always first assess their understanding of their disease. 
- cultural, gender, age, and literacy issues
- avoid jargon , individually tailor. 
- talk back method
