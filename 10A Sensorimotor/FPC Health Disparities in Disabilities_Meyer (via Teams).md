it's our responsibility to retain colleagues with disabilities, excellent care to everyone 
ADA 1990 = any long term mental or physical impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities such as day to day tasks, etc. 

WHO = any condition that is impairing, limits acitivity, and or restricts participation 
- this is the more inclusive one. 

onset of disability - at any age start, can be obvious or hidden, progressive, recurring, chronic or temp 
- mild to profound impact on someone's life 

25.6% of adults in us have disability, and 15.2 % of adults in SC 
- prevalence in iowa - are likely other factors in why certain factors prevelance in 
	- 50.2% of iowans w disabilities hvae income less than 35k 
	- 86.6 %of iowans w disabilities have high school diploma or less 
- one factor = do people qualify for medicaid or social security? there's an income limit you can't go over ): 
- 9.3% med students = disabled... 9.3 with residents. then practicing pysicians 3.1 % .. why did the number drop? 
	- there's greater acceptance of accomodations in training and stigma of asking for accomodations 
	- not wanting to report disability 
	- **largest reason - the income limit, once they make too much, they were making too much to qualify for many of the disability services and then had to weigh whether they wanna continue practice or not**
42% of ppl with disabilities report barriers/delays, 4x more likely to say they've been treated poorly 
3x denied healthcare 
- huge financial barriers. large amount of med bills - 
- patient will pause before choosing to go on another test, procedure, et. healthcare expenditures are huge ): 

hguge thing = quality of life is a big discussion 
- able bodied ppl assume ppl with disabilities have a lower quality of life than the self reported quality of life 

talk about challenges and opportunities to establish diff abilities - results in different type of fluorishing and community - be careful when delivering a dx. 
- just state the facts, natural hx and challenge,s and talk about the opportunities too and realistic expectations, and create relationships in their communities . 
- give a realistic and good mindful framing 

medical model of disability 
- perception - is to make them cured... seen as a condition, sick, pitied, undervalued, and treated like incapacitated. 
- frames impairment as cause for difficulties in this society 
- results in social exclusion or poor treatment 

social model - social construct due to barriers that ppl ith disabilities get in society 
- individua limits aren't the cause of disability , but society's failure to plan for their needs
educational model
- assessments must indicate the disability has a significant impact on their ability to learn in school 
- med dx don't guarantee an educatinal disability or iep - disability must make kid unable to get public edu 

misperceptions 
82% believe that quality of life was worse. only 27% say they welcomed ppl with disabilities into their practice, and only 41% were confident in their ability ot serve. 
- can you life a fulfilling life with severe physical or congiftive disability 
- intellectual disability is lower
- physical disability only 53%... 
this is answers by med students. 

ableism - normal is better, disability is abnormal 
- makes a world where we shape bodies to be normal and shape environments for those bodies alone. 
- blieve that ppl who use wheelchairs greatest wish is to walk

it's possible to have disability and be healthy 
- many aren't in pain or have illness/dz 

how to fix issues
- sensibility - with dignitiy + respect, talk to the disability and not caregiver
- patient has expertise, and always ask be4 you help - extra on mobility devices. 
- patients and families are part of the health team 

it's okay to ask if they prefer person first language or disability first language 
- ike person with down syndrome rather than downs person 
- or autistic 
- person who uses wheelchair vs wheelchair bound 
- intellectual disabiltiy vs other one 
- deaf/hard of hearing rather than haearing impaired
- age appropriateness is huge!!! = treat ppl their age 
- recognize individuality, avoid stereotypign + assumptions 

recognize our values might be diff so ask them what their goals are 
- power to my name and respond to disabilities, explore social determinants and other factors - relationships, employement, mood disorders

proactively ask if accomodations are needed as part of interview invitation 
- budget is not a reason to excuse it 
- serv as allies 
- make sure entire institiution is responsible for cost and not just the department alone 

accomodations
- white coat syndrome 
- understanding procedures
- compliance
- creating liens of sight + visual alarms / signals 
- know ur equipment - weight lims, approaches, maintenance 

parking- finding open accessible parking too and illegal use of ada spaces
