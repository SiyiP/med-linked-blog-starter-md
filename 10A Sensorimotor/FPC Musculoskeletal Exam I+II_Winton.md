![[1. Musculoskeletal Exam I and II_Winton_NOTES (1).pdf]]
MSK exam
we have a workshop later - recall our osce for this is start of 10B. 
hx and phys ex = 90% of tests, then we might do testing like imaging and lab test 

hx is essential 
- pain, swelling, warmth, redness? = inflammation? 
- particular injury ? = is there somthing in mind when the pain started
articular = joint disease
vs extra-articular dz 

age matters too = differential changes bc of it

physical exam 
1. inspection 
	1. i want to start by looking at your shoulders : symmetry, deformity 
2. palpation
	1. use 1-2 fingers and ask if they hurt where i'm touching
		1. clavicles
		2. AC joint
		3. subacromial space posteriorly 
		4. biceps tendon (proximal bicep)
3. range of motion testing 
	1. active- own ability to move joint 
		1. forward flexion - raise your arms in front of your + overhead 
			1. **anterior deltoid, pectoralis major(clavicular head), coracobrachialis, biceps brachii**
		2. extension - raise your arms behind you 
			1. **latissimus dorsi, teres major, posterior deltoid, triceps brachii**
		3. abduction - raise arms to your side
			1. **supraspinatus, middle deltoid, serratus anterior**
		4. adduction - cross your arm in front of your body 
			1. **pectoralis major, coracobrachialis, latissimus dorsi, teres major, subscapularis**
		5. internal rotation - place one hand behind ur back and touch your shoulder blade "see how far up your back you can reach"
			1. **subscapularis, anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, teres major, latissimus dorsi**
		6. external rotation - raise arm to shoulder level, bend your elbow + rotate your forearm towards the ceiling
			1. **infraspinatus, teres minor, posterior deltoid**
	2. passive - examiner moving that joint 
4. muscle strength tests - all that you've done above,  just "against my hand"
	1. 0-5 scale, where 5/5 is normal. 
	2. 4/5 = move against some resistance but gives away 
	3. 3/5 = active movement against gravity but not resistance
	4. 2/5 = can move with no gravity (like in bed)
	5. 1/5 brief flicker of motion 
5. special maneuvers/tests - on the shoulder
	1. for practice only, not on the OSCE
	2. crossover - path at the AC joint, from arthritis/AC separation
		1. adduct the patients arm against their chest
	3. ==empty can test - test the supraspinatus==
		1. elevate the arms 90 degrees and internally rotate their arms with thumbs pointed down 
		2. ask them to resist as you put downward pressure on their arms 
		3. they positive test if pain or inability to hold arm abducted as shoulder level 
	4. apley scratch test - ROM/rotator cuff
		1. ask them to touch the opposite scapula reaching from below/above 
	5. apprehension sign - issues based on joint, anterior stability 
		1. place arm in abduction then externally rotate arm 
		2. positive test - if they're worried that the shoulder would pop out of the socket, if they're uncomfy ): 
	6. hawkins impingement sign - rotator cuff impingement/pinching 
		1. flex shoulder 90 degrees with elbow, with palm down, then rotate arm internally 
	7. neer impingement sign - press on scapula with one hand to prevent motion and flex arm up wtih your other hand 
6. sensation  - peripheral nerve patterns/dermatomes, 
	1. LIGHT touch first:"close your eyes, and let me know which arm we're touching"
		1. lightly touch around the upper arm, and lower and maybe shoulder 
	2. PAIN: is this sharp or dull side we're touching 
		1. we do upper arm: C5/6 dermatomes 
		2. lower arm: C6/T1 dermatomes
7. reflexes ; has 0-4+ scale
	1. 5+ = sustained clonus (repetitive rhythmic motion 
	2. 4+ = short clonus 
	3. 3+ brisk reflex 
	4. 2+ = normal
	5. 1+ is trac/lss than normal 
	6. 0 = absent

		2. one side then the other side

			1. lay down, adn then bring that leg up straight 
		2. crossover straight leg raise tst - same deal with the other nonhurting leg. (additional adjunct test)
	6. observe gait - walking and watching for painful or limp or something  - not on the osce, but they'd walk in front of you.
