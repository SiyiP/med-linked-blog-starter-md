![[2. Neuro Exam I_Milano_Notes.pdf]]
really understand the concepts of this, 

focus on motor exam, sensory exam, reflexs 

first order o business when dx should be **anatomical diagnosis**
- many things can cause this presentation. 
- the exams help us narrow this down 

weakness - how to localize it? 
upper v. lower motor neuro signs
- upper = CNS , brain, spinal cord etc
	- hyperreflexia
	- spasticity/inc tone
	- cortical, cerebellar, cranial nerves 
	- we get inc stuff more bc **upper motor neurons typically have an inhibitory role, so if these ar lost, the lower motor neurons will become too sensitive to signals**
- lower = peripheral NS, or wherever those neurons form with the spinal cords 
	- hyporeflexia, 
	- hypotonia,
	- fasciculations - quivering of muscles, bc the muscls will lose it and quiver / get excite 
	- atrophy 
sensory loss may or may not be present for each but in a specific pattern 

motor exam  -
muscle bulk/tone/strength
first you need to observe - this is the bulk 
1. abnormal movements like tremors(rhythmic and going around a central point) + fasciculations(watch their back for a few min)
	1. resting tremor
	2. postural tremor, tremor while holding something up
2. atrophy? 

then you need to rate it on 5 point scale [[FPC Musculoskeletal Exam I+II_Winton]]
0-5 scale, where 5/5 is normal. 
4/5 = move against some resistance but gives away 
3/5 = active movement against gravity but not resistance (lightest force)
2/5 = can move with no gravity (like in bed)
1/5 brief flicker of motion 
0 = no movement 
note - we must take the patient's age/condition in account, bodybuilder vs 90 year old? 
also take effort/pain in account 
- get them to lift up against gravity first, then towards your applied force. 

muscle groups to check - joints, not muscles: 
- shoulder abduction SA 
- elbow extensionEE
- elbow flexionEF
- wrist extensionWE
- wrist flexion WF
- finger abductionFA
- grip strength
- hip flexionHF
- knee extensionKE
- knee flexion KF
- ankle dorsiflexionDF
- ankle plantar flexion PF
^quick and dirty general screening exam 
there's some additional osce stuff duh 

muscle TONE - do it on everyone - what is normal tone?
- move around their joints!! get a feel for it
- normal = loose
- inc = 
	- spasticity(if you go slow, u can move, but if you move faster, it locks; this localizes to cortical spinal tract, like stroke/trauma) / 
	- rigidity (like bending a pipe; localizes to basal ganglia, like parkingsons)
		- codwheel rigidity like bending a pipe that's liek a rachet???? you're actually feeling their tremor too while pushing down 
- dec = can be seen in lower motor neuron/cerebellar dz
	- floppy baby dz 

coordination -  
- function of cerebellum
	- finger to nose make them touch their nose then touch your finger. dno't get too close, get them to extend arm 
	- heel to shin - take heel, draw straight line down shin all while laying down . 
		- if positive, we might see them doing a back and forth motion 
		- "really try to draw a straight line"
	- rapid alternating movements - do a flapping rapid motion (if they have issues, they can't do it)
	- finger tapping - for osce, tap all 4 fingers. tap each finger , look for speed/ amplitude
- basal ganglia
- corticospinal tract (fine motor)

gait  - note symmetry , balance, posture
this is huge, great for your one test. walk normally , arm swings , stride. **look at their turns**
- tandem gait - toe to heel and straight line (stop once we get too old , 80+ bc balance off)
- toe walk - test strength testing for muscle weakness 
- heel walk -  test strength 
notable types of gait 
1. hemiparetic - stroke, arm flexed but the one leg extended ): one side affected, spastic
2. spastic - scissors - stroke/spinal injury 
	1. can't bend either leg, both legs are spastic instead of just one 
	2. so you have a scissor like walk 
3. steppage - footdrop - step high or trip on ur own food 
4. parkinsonian - stooped posture, small steps - shuffling steps
5. ataxic - off balance
	1. cerebellar or sensory, wide base, unsteady 

additional tests on osce
1. romberg - shouler width apart, stand with your eyes closed, raised arms
	1. poz if they lose balance
	2. testing if you know where the joints are in space. 
	3. if they unsteady with eyes open - think cerebellar 
	4. faal
