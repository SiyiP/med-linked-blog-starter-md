![[2. Neuro Exam I_Milano_Notes.pdf]]
really understand the concepts of this, 

focus on motor exam, sensory exam, reflexs 

first order o business when dx should be **anatomical diagnosis**
- many things can cause this presentation. 
- the exams help us narrow this down 

weakness - how to localize it? 
upper v. lower motor neuro signs
- upper = CNS , brain, spinal cord etc
	- hyperreflexia
	- spasticity/inc tone
	- cortical, cerebellar, cranial nerves 
	- we get inc stuff more bc **upper motor neurons typically have an inhibitory role, so if these ar lost, the lower motor neurons will become too sensitive to signals**
- lower = peripheral NS, or wherever those neurons form with the spinal cords 
	- hyporeflexia, 
	- hypotonia,
	- fasciculations - quivering of muscles, bc the muscls will lose it and quiver / get excite 
	- atrophy 
sensory loss may or may not be present for each but in a specific pattern 

motor exam  -
muscle bulk/tone/strength
first you need to observe - this is the bulk 
1. abnormal movements like tremors(rhythmic and going around a central point) + fasciculations(watch their back for a few min)
	1. resting tremor
	2. postural tremor, tremor while holding something up
2. atrophy? 

then you need to rate it on 5 point scale [[FPC Musculoskeletal Exam I+II_Winton]]
0-5 scale, where 5/5 is normal. 
4/5 = move against some resistance but gives away 
3/5 = active movement against gravity but not resistance (lightest force)
2/5 = can move with no gravity (like in bed)
1/5 brief flicker of motion 
0 = no movement 
note - we must take the patient's age/condition in account, bodybuilder vs 90 year old? 
also take effort/pain in account 
- get them to lift up against gravity first, then towards your applied force. 

muscle groups to check - joints, not muscles: 
- shoulder abduction SA 
- elbow extensionEE
- elbow flexionEF
- wrist extensionWE
- wrist flexion WF
- finger abductionFA
- grip strength
- hip flexionHF
- knee extensionKE
- knee flexion KF
- ankle dorsiflexionDF
- ankle plantar flexion PF
^quick and dirty general screening exam 
there's some additional osce stuff duh 

muscle TONE - do it on everyone - what is normal tone?
- move around their joints!! get a feel for it
- normal = loose
- inc = 
	- spasticity(if you go slow, u can move, but if you move faster, it locks; this localizes to cortical spinal tract, like stroke/trauma) / 
	- rigidity (like bending a pipe; localizes to basal ganglia, like parkingsons)
		- codwheel rigidity like bending a pipe that's liek a rachet???? you're actually feeling their tremor too while pushing down 
- dec = can be seen in lower motor neuron/cerebellar dz
	- floppy baby dz 

coordination -  
- function of cerebellum
	- finger to nose make them touch their nose then touch your finger. dno't get too close, get them to extend arm 
	- heel to shin - take heel, draw straight line down shin all while laying down . 
		- if positive, we might see them doing a back and forth motion 
		- "really try to draw a straight line"
	- rapid alternating movements - do a flapping rapid motion (if they have issues, they can't do it)
	- finger tapping - for osce, tap all 4 fingers. tap each finger , look for speed/ amplitude
- basal ganglia
- corticospinal tract (fine motor)

gait  - note symmetry , balance, posture
this is huge, great for your one test. walk normally , arm swings , stride. **look at their turns**
- tandem gait - toe to heel and straight line (stop once we get too old , 80+ bc balance off)
- toe walk - test strength testing for muscle weakness 
- heel walk -  test strength 
notable types of gait 
1. hemiparetic - stroke, arm flexed but the one leg extended ): one side affected, spastic
2. spastic - scissors - stroke/spinal injury 
	1. can't bend either leg, both legs are spastic instead of just one 
	2. so you have a scissor like walk 
3. steppage - footdrop - step high or trip on ur own food 
4. parkinsonian - stooped posture, small steps - shuffling steps
5. ataxic - off balance
	1. cerebellar or sensory, wide base, unsteady 

additional tests on osce
1. romberg - shouler width apart, stand with your eyes closed, raised arms
	1. poz if they lose balance
	2. testing if you know where the joints are in space. - sensory 
	3. if they unsteady with eyes open - think cerebellar 
	4. falling in shower is an example 
2. pronator drift, hold their arms like your holding a pizza box 
	1. poz if they close eyes and then arms drift down, 
	2. test of weakness , doing prior to strength test as a screener. 

reflexes
- brachioradialis C5-6
- biceps C5-6
- tricepsC7-8
- patellar L3-4
- achilles S1 
- plantar reflex - babinski - scratch their foot up, normal response is flexion, abnormal = exenstion 
	- mute = neuropathy 
5+ = sustained clonus (repetitive rhythmic motion) 
4+ = short clonus 
3+ brisk reflex  
2+ = normal only pluses! it's an artifact of when we used to do it 
1+ = less than normal - if you haave to get a distraction (make fist with other hand) to make the reflex 
0 = absent 

sensory exam - subjective carefullll - do all these irl, not in osce. 
- help with localization - start at feet and go up ... 
	- compare left v right 
	- hands and feet comparison = length dependent 
	- follow their complaints 
	- look for asymmetries and consider dermatomes (radiculopathy) v peripheral nerve territories (peripheral neuropathy) 
- light touch - q pick brush
- vibration 128 hz - tuning fork see if they feel it 
- proprioception - joint position, where you hold the sides of the toe
- temp anything metal's gonna feel old
- pain =- pinprick, sharp vs dull. in real life just use a pin 
**recall - pain/temp - small fiber nerves, impact diabetes/alc**
vibration/proprioception - large fiber B12 def/syphilis 

some examples of lower motor neuron 
- als
- tic paralysis 
- b12 def
- guillain barre syndrome/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy AIDP 

if inc - CNS
- trauma, spine
