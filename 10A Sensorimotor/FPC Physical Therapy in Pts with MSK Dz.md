#clinics 

- low back pain = leading cause of disabiity in the us 
- PT first = lower opiod use of 89.4% decrease and cost shifts help. 
- early PT access is huge to stop as much opiod uses. 
- primary care referral is huge. early utilization = lower odd ratio. 
- early pt timing is associated with reduced risk of everything. 
- **also adherence to PT doesn't matter as much as early referral to the PT**
- sending straight to PT - save healthcare cost. + returned sooner. early referral is the best thing, aside from the red flag syndromes. 
typical PT visit
- health bgd
- screen for red flags
- phys ex with ROM and then moving tthe patient. develop treatment plan - are you eligible and good for PT 
- getting exercises etc etc. ultimate plan to get them on self-home program 
- interprofessional team readyness - to see if there's any potential need for more examination and note the progress of patient 

low back pain - acute v chronic treatments
- acute back pain - based more on clinical signs instead of pathophys. within these classification systems there's clinical prediction rules 
	- mobilization group - to need mobiliity exercises
	- stabilization group 
	- attraction group 
- american physical therapy thing - support of the treatment based grouping syndrome = useful for acute
- for the chronic pain, support for stability and ==active treatment better than passive for healing== 
- don't give that image and pathopneumonic to the patients to make sure to not explain everything you find to them bc that may not be what's responsible to the pain
prevention of chronicity = **early treatment which adheres to guidelines**
- early refer to pt if there are NO red flags
- active treatment over passive 

chronic LBP
- leading cause dsiability, loss ooff oso much 
- most attacks settle but recurrences are common ... they might get these pain common 
- RF for chronicity - **job specific, emotiona stress, and hx of preivous lower back pain is strongest factor**
- recs influenenced getting PT... you need to refer them to the PT 
- overall transition to chronic LBP is much higher. avoid this!! bc hard to manage
- keele start back tool = can estimate risk of transition = there's low-high ... 
	- easy to give, helps aid in clinical dx 
	- 9 total questions 
	- low risk = 3 or less
		- **consider PT referral... support and enable self-management.** they might need the referral anyways to go more into what's going on an think about it 
	- 4+ = look at qs 5-9 
		- 3 or less = medium risk = def refer to PT, to restore function, minimize disability , provide them with best needs, but ultimately no psychological component to this 
		- 4+ high risk = high risk = focus on also improving on psychological functioning, getting more mental therapy. 
			- how are they reacting to their pain
			- patients have high concerns to everything etc. 

- poor outcome predictor with chronic LBP - fear avoidance belief quiestionnaire - this is **related to fear and avoidance towards doing activities and catastrophizing. higher score = higher ear with acitivty**
	- patients iwth out a support network and a high FABQ = the patients who showed little improvement. this is your most at risk population 

oswestry disability index = out of 50, low is better more PT specific survey 
- fear avoidance giving happens when they score high enough to ask bout that. 

start back tool = 2/9 low risk - 
TREAT: with manual therapy, and then heel hand rocking , prone press , open bood, quad bird dog, seated lumbar flexion 
- need 3-4 sessions 
- spend time on multiple positions and control of that. 
- 10 visits total? 

phys ex - 
- dec extension when walking, 
- growing pain with rotation, poor muscle control 
TREAT: transitions, breath thru diagphragm, practic laying down and staying up. 

what exercises are best
- **need to be patient speciic z= based on teir exam. consider having core exercises + aerobics.**
