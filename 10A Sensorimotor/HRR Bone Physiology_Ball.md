in terms of pharmacology, many of our hormones will regulate these things 

calcium homeostasis 
- ca 98% of it in bone 
- huge for muscle contractions, hormone release, etc 
- total plasma calcium is 10 mg/dl, can be bound mostly, mainly ionized form, 60% of it in plasma are useable. 
- **higher pH** = amt of calcium bound to protein inc, **reducing the amount of free useable ionized ca.**

intestines - take up ca 
	==facilitated diffusion throu the small intestine mostly== 
	==active **vitamin D -dependent transport** also happens in prox duodenum==
==bones - take up ca , and resorbed as osteoclasts take it== 
==kidney - reabsorb ca, with small amount put into the urine== 

==phosphate homeostasis== 
- ==80+% in the bone, key regulator of activity , ATP==
- role in urine acidification, with H+ and na+ in tubular urine ==converting Na2HPO4 to NAH2PO4 permits **excretion of acid without dropping urine pH so low that it that would block H+ transport**==
- ==2/3 of this abs in GI tract,== 
- ==transporters regulated by vitamin D inc absorption== 
- in kidneys, **this is the primary determinant of phosphate serum concentration**
	- ==90%+ of plasma phosphate filtered at glomerulus nad 80% actively resobd in prox tubule== 
	- ==low dietary phosphate/D upreg expression of Na-phosphate cotransporter *NPTB2*, **making renal reabsorption key when diet's bad**==
- PTH + fibroblast growth factor 23 are both **inc urinary phosphate excretion by blocking reabsorption** ![[calcium phosphate homeostasis.png]]
summary of the mechanisms 
PTH and vitamin D and calcitonin - there's feedback mechanisms
- ==PTH - makes sure Ca+ stays in bloodstream== - this is a peptide horhome, 31 N-term aa
- ==high level of Ca2+ in blood -> stimulation of **thyroid parafollicular cells** to release calcitonin ,== 
- ==calcitonin makes ca2+ deposition into bone, decreasing blood Ca2+== 
- ==low ca2+ in blood make parathyroid principal cells release PTH==
- ==PTH promotes **release of ca2+== from bone matrix into blood, also stops the Ca2+ loss in urine via the kidney**
- this will also make kidneys release more calcitriol or Vitamin D 
- Calcitriol stimulates inc absorption of Ca2+ in GI tract, **inc blood ca2+**

the PTH - halflife is in minutes
- ==PTH binds to PTH1R which is a GPCR that induces expression of RANKL in osteoblasts, and activates osteoclasts [[SFP Histology of Bone_McDermott]]==
- in kidneys, this inc resorption of Ca2+ , reducing the reabsorption of PO4-3, stimulating vitamin D production
- DOSE effect 
	- TOO much PTH = bone resorption, bone wasting diseases  
	- low and intermittent doses = inc bone formation, strong bone builder, but might cause resorption after given for too long  
- ==**helps to treat osteoporosis**==
- ==SEs: hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria, osteosarcoma in animals== 
- CI: open epiphysis, hypercalc, paget's dz, skeletal metastasis , children , pregnancy/lactation 


vitamin D metabolism 
- ==UV light made from *cholesterol* in skin provitamin D3 -> vitamin D3 cholecaciferol (also from diet)==
- ==in liver, 25-hydroxylase turns it into calcidiol 25(OH)D3... this is what's targeted by PTH==
	- can be further metabolized in the kidney by 1alpha - hydroxylase to make calcitriol !!! 
	- ==helped by PTH==
	- ==inhibited by FGF23 , which can make both calcidiol and calcitriol turn into 24,25(OH)D3, inactive compound via 24-hydroxylase.== 
note: receptor for Vitamin D = transcritpion factor
- VDR receptor, ligand activated
- calcitriol stimulates intestinal ca and phosphate transport by **induction of transporters**
- induce RANKL in osteoblasts 
- 24,25(OH)D3 and other are less potent than calcitriol 1,25(OH)2D3..... 
- note tho 25(OH)D3 more potent than calcitriol in stimulating renal reabsorption of ca and phosphate. 
pharmacokinetics - 
- they are highly bound to plasma proteins, like 42 days... sometimes hours for the tri form. 
- principal clearance via liver
therapeutic application - given for secondary hyperparathyroidism in pts with CKD, hypocalcemias too 
SE: hypercalcemia, hyperphosphemia 
- in cases of chronic kidney dz, just give the active compound already 

when PTH is released from parathyroid gland,the ca will rise and then bind to turn off the PTH gene . same deal with 1,25 vitamin d
in the GI tract, uptake of ca by vitamin d is based on transporter
- ==TRPV5 and TRPV6, which will bnid to calbindin D , maintaining a good role, in the GI tract uptake of ca by vitamin D increasing its expression== 
- inc expression by vitamin D 

==in the kidneys - the ca will interact with the receptors, inhibiting the 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme that converts things to the 1,25 D3 to reduce levels.== 
PTH has an oppostie effect. 

==FGF23 - helps inc phosphate excretion by reducing vitamin D in blood==
- ==this is made in osteoblasts and cytes== 
- ==stimulated by vitamin d, inhibited by DNP.== 
- ==receptor tyrosine kinase binding - in the presence of accessory receptor klotho (mutations in this can disrupt FGF23 singalling, resulting in too much phosphate + vitamin D)==
- ==inactivated by cleavage at RXXR site==

==calcitonin - just recall = **antagonist for effects of PTH**==
- ==parafollicular cells secrete it stimulated by hypercalcemia in the thyroid== 
- salmon calcitonin - ==long half life==, 40-50 min longer, better agent, ==but can **elicit an allergic rxn**==
- a==ctivates GPCR, lowering ca and phosphate by inhibiting osteoclast resorption + formation/resportion of bone reduced with time== 
- TREAT: paget's disease, hypercalcemia, osteoporosis (not first line)

==glucocorticoids - prednisone and stuff -== 
- ==lng term result in osteoperosis / stunted grwth== 
- ==**mainly with antagonizing vitamin D acitivty**== 

==ionized ca = inc with pth, vitamin d, bone resorption== 
plastma phosphate is 
- decreased in hyper PTH, vitamin D def, 
- inc in renal failure, hypo PTH, and vitamin D overload
