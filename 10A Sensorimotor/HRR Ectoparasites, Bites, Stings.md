4. Differentiate brown recluse from black widow spider bite presentations.
5. Describe general principals of treatment for jellyfish and scorpion stings.
6. Describe the clinical presentations of pediculosis (lice infestations), high risk groups for infestation, treatments, and potential complications.


- Scabies
	- sarcoptes scabei mite
	- transmission via sex or prolonged skin, very rarely via fomites 
		- - Fertilized female mite burrows into stratum corneum, lays eggs(3-6 week incubation period) + feces then dies. 
		- larvae hatch in your skin, itching as a T4 hypersensitivity rxn against mite 
	- RF: crowded living conditions 
	- very intense pruritus at night increasing
	- wrists, interdig folds of hands/feet, male genitalia, intertriginous areas. 
	- variable lesions often mistaken for eczema 
	- **crusted scabies**= seen in immunosuppressed/elderly etc.. 
		- **absent pruritis, but high mite load + contagious**
		- must treat aggressively with scabicide 
	- inside = we see dermoscopy skin bubble with a bunch of thin exoskeletin with spines inside, burrowed in 
	- FIRST LINE: permethrin 5% cream to **inhibit voltage gated na channels in mites, delaying repol of neurons + paralyzing them.**
	- complication of bacterial supeinfection of **skin lesions**, leading to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis 
- Lice - ectoparasite, obligate
	- lay nits/eggs on base o hair
	- larvae go thru 3 nypmh stages, 3-4 wk adult 
	- - Head lice - species Pediculus humanus capitis
			kids, direect contact, asymptomatic initially then scalp/neck  pruritis , detect + cnfirm with wood's lamp 
			- **1% permethrin shampoo or pyrethrin** 
	- Body lice – species Pediculus humanus corpori_s 
		- 3-5 mm in length, from direct contact
		- most common in ppl living in crowded unsanitary conditions ): 
		- CC of pruritis, puncta from fresh bites, excoriations ilnear, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation 
		- also treat with the permethrins or pyrethrin 
		- complications happen wit secondary skin infection
			- rickets prowazekii = epidemic typhus
			- borrelia recurrentis relapsing fever
			- bartonella quintana - trench fever 
	- Pubic lice and Pediculosis ciliaris - Pthirus pubis
		- crabs 
		- sexual usually 
		- puriritis and excoriations in pubic area - and mainly **maculae cerulae blue purple macules in ppl with chronic infection**
		- again use pediculicides and then machin wash hot stuff. 
		- TREAT: with mechanically removing these guy s
- Insect bites / stings
    - Fleas - pruritis and dermatitis and then secondary bacterial infections. egg to larva to pupa to adult. incubate inthe **soil grass or carpet**
    - Bedbugs - red brown, itchy red and in a line !!! 
    - Spiders
	    - brown recluse spider = violin shape marking on back, necrotoxin with local tissue necrosis if he bites
		    - bite painless 
		    - blister painful
		    - skin discolor
		    - eschar/necrosis in days 
	    - widow spider -variable red marks + hour glass ...... neurotoxin latrotoxin + causes exocytosis too much of ach + NE 
		    - painful bite, red macule 
		    - target lesion late. 
    - Jellyfish - stinggs vary, but nematocyts on tentacles will discharge this
	    - local effects = acute pain + linear urticarial lesions 
	    - avoid water !! or rubbing sting cytes bc that can trigger more nematocyts. 
	    - add vinegar, and stuff. and 50% bakin soday slurry 
    - Hymenoptera Bees/Wasps/Fire ants
	    - 10% of all anaphylaxis/allergic effects
	    - local impact - acute, swelling,rythema, itching in minutes, resolve in 2-3 days 
    - Scorpions - bark scorpion 
	    - in southwest USA , but neurotoxins in venum will inhibit the inactivation of sodium channels. more prolonged depol = hyperexcitability 
	    - local severe pain, swelling, erythema 
	    - neuromusc tox = cranial nerve function (eye movemetn weird) 
	    - ==somatic skeletal NM dysfunciton - fasciculations, jerking of extremities== 
	    - autonomic dysfun
