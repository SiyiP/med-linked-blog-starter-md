5. Describe general principals of treatment for jellyfish and scorpion stings.
6. Describe the clinical presentations of pediculosis (lice infestations), high risk groups for infestation, treatments, and potential complications.


- Scabies
	- sarcoptes scabei mite
	- transmission via ==sex or prolonged skin==, very rarely via fomites 
		- - Fertilized female mite burrows into stratum corneum, lays eggs(3-6 week incubation period) + feces then dies. 
		- larvae hatch in your skin, itching as a T4 hypersensitivity rxn against mite 
	- RF: crowded living conditions 
	- ==very intense pruritus at night increasing, **tortuous tunnes in skin lead to red papules and pustules**==
	- wrists, interdig folds of hands/feet, male genitalia, intertriginous areas. axilla elbows too 
	- variable lesions often mistaken for eczema 
	- ==**crusted scabies**= seen in immunosuppressed/elderly etc..== 
		- ==**absent pruritis, but high mite load + contagious**==
		- must treat aggressively with scabicide 
	- inside = we see ==dermoscopy skin bubble with a bunch of thin exoskeletin with spines== inside, burrowed in 
	- FIRST LINE: ==permethrin== 5% cream to **i==nhibit voltage gated na channels in mites, delaying repol of neurons + paralyzing them.**==
	- complication of bacterial supeinfection of **skin lesions**, leading to ==post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis== 
- Lice - ectoparasite, obligate
	- lay nits/eggs on base o hair
	- larvae go thru 3 nypmh stages, 3-4 wk adult 
	- - Head lice - species Pediculus humanus ==capitis==
			kids, direect contact, asymptomatic initially then scalp/neck  pruritis , detect + cnfirm with wood's lamp 
			==- **1% permethrin shampoo or pyrethrin**== 
	- Body lice/louse – species Pediculus humanus ==corporis== 
		- 3-5 mm in length, from direct contact
		- most common in ppl living in ==crowded unsanitary conditions ):== 
		- CC of ==pruritis, puncta from fresh bites, excoriations ilnear, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation== 
		- also treat with the ==permethrins or pyrethrin== 
		- complications happen wit secondary skin infection
			- ==rickets prowazekii = epidemic typhus==
			- ==borrelia recurrentis relapsing fever==
			- ==bartonella quintana - trench fever== 
	- Pubic lice and Pediculosis ==ciliaris== - Pthirus pubis
		- ==crabs== 
		- sexual usually 
		- puriritis and excoriations in pubic area - and mainly ==**maculae cerulae blue purple macules in ppl with chronic infection**==
		- again use ==pediculicides== and then machin wash hot stuff. 
		- TREAT: with mechanically removing these guy s
- Insect bites / stings
    - Fleas - ==pruritis and dermatitis and then secondary bacterial infection==s. egg to larva to pupa to adult. incubate inthe ==**soil grass or carpet**==
    - Bedbugs - red brown, ==itchy red and in a line !!!== 
    - Spiders
	    - brown recluse spider = violin shape marking on back, n==ecrotoxin with local tissue necrosis if he bites==
		    - ==bite painless== 
		    - ==blister painful==
		    - skin discolor
		    - ==eschar/necrosis in days== 
	    - widow spider -variable red marks + hour glass ...... ==neurotoxin latrotoxin + causes exocytosis too much of ach + NE== 
		    - painful bite, ==red macule== 
		    - ==target lesion late.== 
    - Jellyfish - stinggs vary, but nematocyts on tentacles will discharge this
	    - local effects = ==acute pain + linear urticarial lesions== 
	    - ==avoid water !! or rubbing sting cytes bc that can trigger more nematocyts.== 
	    - ==add vinegar, and stuff. and 50% bakin soda slurry== 
    - ==Hymenoptera Bees/Wasps/Fire ants==
	    - 10% of all anaphylaxis/allergic effects
	    - local impact - acute, ==swelling,rythema, itching in minutes, resolve in 2-3 days== 
    - Scorpions - ==bark scorpion== 
	    - in ==southwest== USA , but neurotoxins in venum will in==hibit the inactivation of sodium channels==. more ==prolonged depol = hyperexcitability== 
	    - ==local severe pain, swelling, erythema== 
	    - neuromusc tox = ==cranial nerve function (eye movemetn weird)== 
	    - ==somatic skeletal NM dysfunciton - fasciculations, jerking of extremities== 
	    - ==autonomic dysfunciton tooo== 
	    - antivenom cure
