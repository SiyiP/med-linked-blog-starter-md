#sensorimotor 

nerve-musc junction - 
- each motor unit = motor neuron + all muscle fibers it innervates 
- - presynaptic axon boutons with schwann cell myelin sheath ,,, postsynaptic muscle membrane is part of that junction too 

- these muscle fibers will fuse together , multinucleated single cell 
- motor unit = each motor neuron makes synapses with many fibers of the same type, each fiber is contacted by 1 motor neuron... 
	- every time that motor neuron releases, itll release ach which makes however many fibers it's connected to contract 
	- stimulation of like smlal nuber = small inc in movement force
	- stim of large number of fibers = large inc 
	- motor neurons are very specialized **and can inenrvate thee same type of msucle fibers, allowing for that specialization and changes, like fast and slow twitch**
- thousands of muscle fibers in each muscle

motor endplate = both presynaptic and postsynaptic speciailzations 
- nicotinic ach receptors.. 
- ion channels primarily sodium will depol the underlying muscles, adn then those channels spra the AP across the cell

NMJj
- presynaptic
	- large bouton = swelling at end of motor neuron axon, many mitochondria + many vesicels of ach 
- postsynaptic - infolded muscle membrane, large SA, many Ach receptors 

nicotinic ach receptor
- mutlimeric ion channel
- 5 subunits, 2 alpha, 1 beta, gamma, delta
- ach binding site = interface of alpha/gamma + alpha/deltas = contributes to pocket of binding for ach 
	- once it's bound, it will open up the channel, making that aqueous pore open more 
- each of the subunits = 4 transmembrane domains... so 20 transmembrane domains in total 
	- to anchor it in place
	- laree amino terminus on the outside, which is where you get the binding of ach 
	- M2 domain, transmembrane, is inside the membrane, every 3rd aa is facing the poor
		- M2 = domains is a **alpha helix which ultimately FACE each other**
		- critical for defining the **aqueous pore  highly selective for monovalent cations, like na+ k+ **
- brain has also this, but the genes are different
	- just has alpha, beta genes, more specific
	- activated by nicotine , **will desensitize the nicotinic receptor, causing them to get paralyzed ultimately by shutting this whole thing down**
- these are BLOCKED by curare and derivatives = compouns that will antagonize and compete for the receptor binding sits. = paralysis basically 
	- some are used during surgery to relax muscles to make it easier to surgery 

ACH - 
- from acetylcoa and choline... by choline acetyl transferase/ChAT
	- we can use Chat antibodies to see where the ACH neurons are 
- packed into vesicles by transporter, then release from these upon **depol/ca entry**
- in skeletal, activates ionotropic nicotinic ach receptors
	- compare to muscarinic receptors, found on smooth msucle and more parasympathetic stuff 
- broken by acetylcholinerase choline takes up back into the terminal 
- cholinesterase inhibitors - physiostigmine, neostigmine are used to treat some forms of muscle weakness 

end plate potential 
- postsynaptic site of action 
- basicaly AP will be submitted, and then you check for the msg received at the plate, based on how far it can be 
- synaptic delay = slight lag .5-1 msec, all the steps like na channels, ca channels opening flux, synaptotagmin, and all that opening for depol that causes the depol 
- EPP end platepotential occurs largely at the site of synapse, end plate 
- current carried by inward Na+ and K+ out = **-5 mV, higher permeability to Na+**
- EPP decays = from **passive properties of muscle membrane reflected by time/capacitance and length/resistanc constant**
	- shows EPP is very lcalized to just that synapse with the fast decay 
- in absence of curare , EPP will trigger voltage gated sodium channels in the adjacent muscle membrane, causing a full blown AP that will propogate over the rest of the muscle membrane = contraction . 
note = the synapse is in the **middle of muscle fiber cell, which allows for the spread of AP throughout the whole msucle at the same time p much**

effect of acetylcholine esterase
- limits the action of Ach by splitting this into choline + acetate 
- this is a super high rate of working 
- antagonists to ach-esterase = result in larger EPP and AP due to long lifespan of ach 
	- used to enhanc muscle strength = like botulism (interferes with release of ACH) myasthenisia gravis(antibodies against that nicotinic aCH receptor), etc.. but too much can cause desensitization resulting in paralysis and weakness

miniature end plate potentials = mEPPs
- record rom msucle membrane
- this is spontanouely arising, witout any stimulation of the muscle before
- small amplitude membrane depolariations
- from the **fusion of one vesicle and release of its Ach**
- evidence of quantal release of NT since the amplitude of thse are identical and amplitude scales with number of vesicles that stimultaneousy fuse 
- not propogated down length of muscle 

effect of sr calcium changes
- ca involved in triggering Ach vesicle fusion presynpaticlly and contractile filaments post synaptic
- changes in sr calcium can impact underlying muscle excitability 
- **note there is a large safety factor, where normal changes in this dn't significantly affect ach release.**

**hypercalcemia = muscle gets a little less excitable, bc higher calcium = reduce na+ entry since it's very large for the pore, so WEAKER muscle**

hypocalcemia - more excitable/**random/spontaneous muscle twitching**, might inc membrane permeability, membrane gets more leaky!!! so may inc permeability, brinign membrane **closer to threshold for firing, with the Na+ leaking out**


differences wit CNS synpases
- NMJ
	- one type of presynaptic axon = the motor neuron 
	- 1 NT ACH
	- ACH always excitatory 
	- each AP releases large amt of Ach 
	- each EEP **always above threshold, so one AP = one ontraction**
- CNS
	- many types of presynaptic axons, 
	- many diff NTs converges on single neuron at many locations
	- mix of excit, inhib, modulatory
	- each psp is small, summation is required for ap either temporal or spatial 

disorders of the motor unit ![[motor unit disorder map.png]]
- tetanus toxin = soil bacteria, migrates into the spinal cord to impact the inhibitory interneurons there, putting a break into the excitability of that neuron 
	- protease, wil cleave VAMP, etc, blocking the release of the **inhibitory Neurotransmitter**, always contracted and firing off basically  
	- basically this will always be contracted , sustained excitability of the muscle 
	- severe cramping 
- diptheria toxin = attacks myelin producing cells like in the schwann cells, impairing the AP , 
	- can't contract muscle
- tetrodotoxin - issue in the nodes of ranvier, so 
	- ==super high affinity to the voltage gated sodium channel antagonization (bc they are all in the nodes)== 
	- primarily from bacteria of marine environment 
	- TTX = fugu usually - fish eating, and then it will kill them 
	- pins and needles, coma and resp distress
- botulinum = bacteria from unprocessed foood, bean can will be bulging out 
	- similar to tetanus, but **targets aCh terminals and the machinery in the NMJ which are meant to release them as vesicles**
	- blocks ACH release 
	- used in botox which will **relax skeletal msucles where you smile**
- black widow toxin - 
	- ==fusion of many **vesicles of ach in calcium INDEPENDENT fashion**== 
	- local contraction under local spider bite toxin 
- alpha-==bungarotoxin== - from Krait snake
	- ==antagonist of nicotinic ach receptor = essentially permenant inhibitor.==
	- fundamentally lethal

Muscle physio - skeletal muscle function 
architecture 
muscles organized into fibers, into fasciles
sarcomere = fundamental unit 
- myofilaments inside each fiber = actin, tropomyosin, troporin, myosin
- z lines too 
- actin = most important for contractin 
	- thin filament = made of double strand of actin 
	- globular g actin = **polymerize into filamentous or f actin**
- myosin = attaches to actin and does movement along the actin skeelton 
	- thick filament 
	- made up of bundle of myosin moelcules, these helix groups
	- light meromyosin LMM and heavy meromyosin HMM
		- light = tail group , long double helix tail
		- heavy = more like sperm , like the head
			- contains atpase site, catalytic sites to generate contraction 
			- actin-binding site 
- tropomyosin = occludes binding sites along actin for myosin 
	- filamentous protein, wraps around actin , occluding binding site for myosin 
- troponin-c = binds calcium, releasing the tropomyosin 
	- calcium binding protein 
sarcomere
- z line to z line
- actin tails are anchored onto the z lines
- myosin tails on the m lines, and will extend towards the z lines 
- max overlap between thick and thin filaments = **a band, area of thickness/darkenss**
-  zone = no thin actin filaments
- I band = only thin actin filaments, the light band, will be overlapping into the next sarcomere 

filament overlap 
- regular spacing between filaments
- each thin filament close to 3 thick filaments
- each thick filament surrouded by 6 thin filaments. 
- this is huge the physical connection of myosin to actin underlies contraction process
- 2 types of actin = globular and filamentus 
- structual proteins mentioned - 
	- titin = helps keep it all org in linear function 
	- desmin
	- nebulin 
	- skelemin 

tubular systems
sarcooplasmic reticulum 
- intracellular organelle in msucle cell which stores and releases ca2+ inside hte muscle cell
- will overlap and enlarge at the t tubule to make a lateral sac
- overlays the area of max overlap between myosin and actin 
t tubules
- holes in membrane = infolding of sarcolemmas/muscle membranes, which will **carry the electrical signal, conduciting it and centered right over the z lines**
- triad = t tubule in contact with lateral sacs or sarcoplasmic reticulum enlargements ... from adjacent SR organelles 

sliding filament therory 
- z lines move closer together, shortening the sarcomere, where actin and myosin slide past one another
- overall shortening of each muscle = due to **abilty of myosin to make crosslinks with actin, so it's able to bind and wrap itself around it, likign pulling itself**
	- continue to do that until getting to max tension, or the closest the fibers can get 

muscle contraction - role of atp cycle 
- at rest, myosin heads = cocked with ADP bound 
- release of ca from SR , binds to troponin-C, allows for the tropomyosin to move a bit and expose actin binding sites allowing for myosin attachment 
- attached myosin heads would put force on pulling thick and thin filaments past one other = **power stroke**
- in order for the myosin head group to eject and retach, we need **to get rid of ADP, and replace with ATP**
	- allows for myosin head to detach and reset 
	- and then hydrolyze that atp to reform the rest position 

when ppl pass away, we get trapped into the phase of permenant contaction = rigor mortis until the protein of muscle gets degraded, making it relax

excitation-contraction coupling - we link NMJ with the skeletal muscle
1. AP causes depol , thru ach release
2. basically end plate potential suffiecient, activating sodium channels in t tubules 
3. in the t tubules, that way that ca+ release from SR from ryanodine receptors get relesed... 
4. then ca+ binding to troponin -c , allowing mysin/actin binding
5. cross bridges form and pull thin filaments
6. ca+ uptake into SR reduces this concentration, switching off that process to control time of contraction too 

contraction of whole muscle
- isotonic - shorten to lift load - weight moved off of ground, and then maintain that height...
	- concentric = muscle length dec -  muscle length dec from actually lifting a weight 
	- eccentric = muscle length inc - the crossbridges that are formed, will eventually pull apart, some muscles are lengthening 
- isometric = force happens without shrotening = weight too heavy, cannot pick up obj but still generate the tension, still contraction like muscles to maintain posture. 

single twitch/series elasticity 
- twitch response to single motor neuron ap 
- slight delay before tension develops = latent period bt ap and tension 
- contraction time - to peak tension 
- relaxation time. as ca is decreased = bakc to baseline. 
- why does tension not develop liek a square wave instead? the muscle can be elastic, much of **physical strethcing in that zone maybe like with tendons ** before things get serious 
- single twitch responses never get to the max possible tension that muscles can do 

3 mechs by which contraction force be graded
- summation/tetanus - summation of all the motor neurons, inc rate of motor stim/aps
	- similar to electrical - when a 2nd stimulus occurs b4 first twitch relaxes, you add to the ap 
	- additional bolus of ca happens 
	- **tetatnus = high freq stimulation results in continuous summation *to a plateau;;;***
		unfused tetanus = some relaxation bt responses, a few humps 
		fused tetanus= smooth tension maintained during stimulation 
	- why we have summation: active state = capacity of muscle to ccontract wihtout series elasticity, corresponding to just ca++ concentration 
		- most of the active state tension goes to strech the series elasticity 
		- by th time tension acutally devs, ca concentration already too low bc of delay
		- during tetanus , internal ca never falls, force rises to max = **active state**
- length tension relationship = maxing the overlap of muscle filaments - inc and dec the amoutn of crossbridges
	- optimum = max am filament overlap 
	- strethcing or compressing can reduce force
	- or overshortening of the fibers = myosin bounces off.z line can't produce tension either 
	- msucles usually attached in body near optimum strength 
	- resting length of muscles = maximal length tension optimum relationships 
- recruitment of motor units = adding more contractiles
	- get more motor neurons, muscls are made up of each one since each motor neuron contact same type f msucle fibers
	- if we fire all neuons that are in that muscl we can caus huge reaction 
	- usually small units are first, but large ones are for greater tension increases, easily fatigued, use up the ATP easily though. 
---
muscle adaptation 
- msucles use ATP critically as well as CA-ATPase 
- creatine phosphate = short term atp storage can supply by donating high energy phosphate to adp 
	- high ernergy phosphate give to ATP 
	- very limited in muscle 
- glycogen and glucose breakdown to make it - some have a igher amoutn than other muscles or others use ox phos 
- oxygen and capillaries to provide the oxygen depends on the type of muscle, depends on myoglobin and bv content 
sustainabiiliy 
- free atp is small 
- phosphagen system and glycolysis makes atp for power and short duration= high intensity stuff  
- but ox phos/kreb cycle makes for endurance 
	- generates like 20 atps 

msucls - made up of **mosaic** of many diff fiber types 
- ==type 1 =- slow twich muscles - myosin ATPase is slow, so hydrolysis is slow, fatigue resistance (so use ox phs to make atp)==
	- red 
	- rate of myosin ATPase relatively slow 
	- rate of fatigue slow bc use ox phos, high oxidation and low glycogen capacity bc using o2 , **for that reason use many Mts and BVs**
	- ==a lot of myoglobin content , which binds o2 in muscle = red!== 
	- have a small diameter , matched with a small motor neuron 

- ==type 2 = fast speed = somewhat fatigue resistant 2A or not fatigue resistant 2B== 
	- ==2A - moderately fast, red, moderately fatigue resistant== 
		- in the middle
		- use both ox and glycolytic pathways
		- intrmediate size and intrmediate size motor neurons 
	- ==2B  - fast, white, easily fatigued==
		- high rate of myosin ATPase, 
		- ==high fatigue rate bc use glycolytic pathway primarily, low oxidative capacity, so low o2, low myoglobin, and low bvs== 
		- ==largest diameter, and bc o that it's matched with **spinal neurons with large diameter too**==

motor unit = one motor neuron + all fibers it synapses with 
- but each neuron synpases with only **one type of fiber!!!**
- recruited in order from slow to fast as demand inc 
- ==type 1 = **smaller recruited before larger type 2 due to smaller capacitance, higher input resistance,==
- less input needed to reach threshold for firing than large motor neurons**
- V = IR
- ==basically larger = more leaky , thre's a subtreshold epsp = so needs a much higher input to generate an actual AP, so imagine the smaller type 1 neurons reaching AP first and getting recriuted first== 
- recruited from ==slow to fast==... small motor units that only have **a few fibers per neuron are recruited first followed by large motor units with many ones that make larger increments in force**
- on demand as needed systm 

muscles vary in contraction sppeed
- ==ocular muscl fastest, most 2B type 2 fibers== 
- gastrocenmius = 
- ==soleus slowest , has most type 1 fibers== 

fiber type distrib in the same muscle differ between individuals= good profiling for athletes, hard to change fiber types = ppl born with that distribution 
- explosive hiit = type 2 b 
- marathons = type1 fibers 


exercise adaptation
- high resistance, short duration trainig, weight lifting 
- ==adaptation mainly affects type 2 fibers, inc in size,== 
- hypertrophy 
	- actin + myosin
	- cross sectional area
	- vol of sarcotubule system RNA/DNA/nucllei
	- glycogen
	- creatine 

long duration low intensity 
==long and low intensity - main effect on type 1/2A fibers==
- inc fatigue resistance 
- inc in 
	- mt
	- expression of ox enzymes
	- myoglobin 
	- capillary density 

potassium -  impacts resting membrane potential
	hypokalemia = hyperpolarization, weakness,
	==hyperkalemia = depol, inc excitability, spontaneous twitches== 

muscle repair/regen
- adult muscle cells = post mitotic, can't divide
- but after mild/mod forms of injury, they have **satellite cells, stem cells, under mild injury in normal exercise, you can activate them into myoblasts and replace some injured ccells**
- stil need template + basemnt membrane 
- more severe strain inuries = produce rupture bt tendon + muscle but can also be repaired with some performance effect
traumatic injury - with bony fractures or gunshots req surgical removal of dmg'd muscle to rpevent **acute extremity compartment syndrome AECS**
- where dying msucle exerts force upon the fascia
- muscle is not normally regen under tehse conditions ): results in volumetric muscle loss + physical disability
