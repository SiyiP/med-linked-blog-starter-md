group is used worldwide and wide variety of uses 
predict action based on these ; these are all **variables affecting LA action**
- nerve fiber characteristics
	- correction: unmyelinated fibers ae relatively insensitive to local anesthetics ... 
	- in general **the smaller the nerve fiber the more sensitive they are to local anesthetics** = so small unmyelinated C fibers don't happen to react well. 
	- pain > temp > touch > pressure > motor function nerves
	- **thinner myelinated fibers have more node sper unit, so LAs have more access on these nodes...**
- physiochm properties of drug
	- more lipophillic = more potent. 
	- more protein binding = higher duration of lasting/efficacy 
- effect of pH 
	- pka = ph - log(base)/(conjugate acid)
	- pkas fo LAs are higher. 
	- recall = ionized form is responsible fr blocking channel but non-ionized form helps pass thru the cell membrane
	- low pH = **shift to ionized form**
	- high pH = shift towards the free base form 
	- **important = inflammation makes a dec in pH and therefore will decrease effectiveness of the local anesthetics...**
	- closer pka is to physiological pH = faster onset of action of local anesthetics 
- biotransformation/metabolism
	- we don't want them to be absorbed bc we want them to be local;; systemic absorption ultimately leads to termination of this local anesthetic effect... 
	- relative to dosage and know that use of vasoconstrictors affect this 
	- phase 1 => reactive intrmediate then cyt p450 in liver... or by esterases in plasma 
		- ester type eliminations 
		- hydrolyzed in plasma by cholinesterases to aromatic acid + alc
		- pts with **atypical forms of this can xperience prolongged effects/toxicity**
		- **also more able to cause allergies bc of making p-aminobenzoic acid** from esterase brkdown
- effect of vasoconstrictors 
	- we use this with all ... 
	- vasodilating properties of all LAs except cocane limits duration of action of these compounds
	- adding these vasoconstrictors will : 
		- prolong **depth and time of anesthesia**
		- reduce rate of systemic absorption 
		- epinephrine most commonly coformulated with LAs .. 
learn them by a class and fairly easy point of drugs

esters = -caine - metabolised by **esterases** in the plasma , more prone to causing allergic rxns  = metabolized in the plasma 
- procaine - ester of **para-aminobennzoic acid PABA (rxns)**
	- infiltation, short duration 
- benzocaine - lacks hydrophillic component, relatively insoluble + used in topicals 
	- short duration 
	- **watch out - methemoglobinemia** - can oxidize ferrous groups in heme, causing dark chocoolate blood 
- cocaine - only local that has **vasoconstrictor properties, usually only used for ENT procedures**; all other LAs are really just vasodilators. 
	- watch out - tachy arrthymias 
	- sympatheticmimetiic actions.. 
amides = -caine AND has an i in it before. cleared out by the liver stuff 
- lidocaine - 
	- quick onset intrmediate duration for wide variety of procedures 
- bupivacaine
	- slow onset, long duration 
	- used for neuraxial anesthesia
	- watch for **cardiotox, more cardiotox than other locals, esp with mobitz II ; most ppl give test dose + epi**
		- 2nd degree AV block = atrial impulse is delayed or blocked... where some are blocked and others are conducted. baically a p wave not followed by a qrs. 
	- more prone to causing motor block 
- ropivacaine
	- l-enantiomer of bupivacaine, more expensive, neuraxial anesthesia 
	- slow onset, long duration 
	- **les spotent and cardiotox than bupivacaine**
- articaine 
	- mixed amide/ester = **terminated by ester hydrolysis**
	- intermediate duration, for dental procedures 

wide variety of uses - 
- q tip and putting it in mouth , topical, peripheral nerve  blocks, 
- and some like lidocaine can treat arrhythmias so be careful 

STRUCTURE: learn that this is like dual coating 
they are typically **weak bases that carry a + charge in tertiary amine group in normal body pH**
- has aromatic ring = lipophillic 
	- defines potency, the more lipophilic, the more potent, less you have to use 
	- they need to get into the cell to work - **these all block voltage gated na channels from the inside of the cell so they have to cross nerve membranes readily**
		- **this will raise the threshold potential and slow conduction capacity to block pain impulses**
		- they have to cross membrane to get to the channels
		- nonionized form = crosses nerve sheath and plasma membrane
		- then it will go inside and the **charged/ionized form ON THE INSIDE tends to bind better to the voltage gated na channel; the cationic form**!!! interesting equilibrium 
		- recall they have selective preference for **binding ot the inactivated stage of the voltage gated channel.... we want the channel to be inactivated, so there's gonna be a higher proportion of inactivated state that allows drug to bind** = this is known as "use dependence"
	- for epidural anesthesia, 2% lidocain's needed but .5% bupivacaine is needed instead 
- intermediate chain = type of linkage , basis of classification as either esters or amides. **determines route of metabolism + allergic potential**
	- def
- amine portion = alkyl groups attached to amine nitrogen ...
	- groups connect to the nitrogen determine water solubility , if it's 
	- water insoluble =- use topically 
some beta blockers do have these structures and some antihistamines are similar - but they're not classified as LAs but share a similar general structure + local anesthestic properties 
- also consider pka - onset of action
	- **unionized portion of tis is able to cross thru membrane better**
	- pka = uncharged base free form lipid-soluble proportion 
	- agents with **lower pKa have greater proportion in uncharged base free form at neutral pH, which can make them onset speed FASTER**
	- they all have fairly high pkas bc they are all bases.
		- meaning most of the drug will be that inactive ionized form that can't cross the membranes. 
- **consider protein binding = duration of action is higher**
	- local anesthetics primarily bind to alpha-1-acidic glycoprotein + albumin to serve as a **reservoir**
	- inc protein binding => affinity of the local anesthetic for the vltage gated na channel 
	
clinical uses of LAs
- topicals - usually lidocaine/benzocaine 
- infiltration anesthesia - like dental procedures or insertions prior to painful injections 
- regional - peripheral nerve blocks, IV regional anesthesia 
stuff like epidurals - putting that into the space there. of the spine. in your spinal, its like L3 to block below that point. 
- if you position the patient and inject with their leg up, that causes this infiltration to go further higher 
- neuraxial anesthesia - spinal + epidural
	- spinal req less anesthetic than deep epidural + caudal which req larger doses/volumes
	- in addition to somatic lbockade, this anesthesia causes sympathetic bloockage, which **might get hypotension and drop in HR/CO**
	- does NOT bock vagus nerve
	- **be careful with anticoagulants, might cause hematoma that presses the spinal cord and cause irreversible dmg**
lidocaine might be pushed to block pain on injection of other drugs

LAST = LA systemic toxicity  = prodromes
initial
- tinnitus
- metalic taste 
- cNS excitation, 
- anxiety
- visual changes 
other progression 
- seizures
- convulsions, cardiac arrest
- resp failure 
need to use
- **benzodiazepines to control seizures and maintain oxygenation with ventilatory + circ support** + lipid emulsion to pull away LA from circulation 
- if ventricular arrhythmia comes, use **amiodarone**
- lipid emulsion = intralipid/liposyn - used to pull away the local an. from the site of action + used for other toxicities of lipid soluble drugs; many CNS drugs  
and recall all LA except cocaine cause vasodilation 
- so BP lows = CV collapse 
- myocardium excitbility, contractions, and conduction velocity all fall 
- **like esp with bupivacaine**
- if epi goes in vessel and then hr goes up... it means you inject into a vein. 
- but if no change in hr, then you're extravascular and okay .
