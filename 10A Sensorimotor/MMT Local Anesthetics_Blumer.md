group is used worldwide and wide variety of uses 
predict action based on these 
- nerve fiber characteristics
- physiochm properties of drug
- effect of pH 
- biotransformation/metabolism
- effect of vasoconstrictors 
learn them by a class and fairly easy point of drugs

esters = -caine - metabolised by esterases in the plasma , more prone to causing allergic rxns 
- procaine
- benzocaine
- cocaine 
amides = -caine AND has an i in it before. cleared out by the liver stuff 
- lidocaine
- bupivacaine
- ropivacaine
- articaine 

wide variety of uses - 
- q tip and putting it in mouth , topical, peripheral nerve  blocks, 
- and some like lidocaine can treat arrhythmias so be careful 

STRUCTURE: learn that this is like dual coating 
they are typically **weak bases that carry a + charge in tertiary amine group in normal body pH**
- has aromatic ring = lipophillic 
	- defines potency, the more lipophilic, the more potent, less you have to use 
- intermediate chain = type of linkage , basis of classification as either esters or amides. **determines route of metabolism + allergic potential**
	- def
- amine portion = alkyl groups attached to amine nitrogen ...
	- groups connect to the nitrogen determine water solubility , if it's 
	- water insoluble =- use topically 
some beta blockers do have these structures and some antihistamines are similar - but they're not classified as LAs but share a similar general structure + local anesthestic properties
