2 properties = to ensure immobility during surgery and to facilitate intubation and ventilate patients. 
- most freq cause of anaphylaxis in perioperative period = NMBAs!! bc they're paralyzed and can't tell you about their reactions to exposures 

non-depolarizing drugs = basically competitive antagonists -cur-, and -ium think of them as permenantly charged - looks like ammonia steroids, bc of charges, they cannot cross membranes, so **that's why if you eat an animal injected with this you don't get paralyzed**
	- basically they don't do anything to resting membrane potential, simply blocking that receptor , preenting the ACH from binding to that. 
	- margin of safety = you need to ventillate them but there's a **lot of spare receptors... that means you will have more and more receptor blockage, you have to block like 70-80% of all receptors to get any kind of meaningful paralysis**
	- at some point, the drug gets metabolized... and might take you out of paralysis, and hard to see how much to inject to get them back into paralysis again bc you might get **overparalysis**
	- add **neostigmine** = reversal of blockage. 
		- this is a ACHesterase inhibitor, making ACH **levels go up, which will then OUT-compete with the non-depol NMBA**
	- atropine is given prior to neostigmine - **bc atropine would *prevent* SLUDGE effect, especially bradycardia, bronchospasm, bronchorrhea** from cholinergic crisis 
	- **sugammadex** - at musc, and expensive... but used a lot. this is a chemical antagonist, for rocuronium binding and titrating it out and elimination into the urine= not prototype. and be careful with ppl with renal function ... and SE of blocking steroidal drugs, like **progesterone bound by sugammadex and efficacy of the contraceptives.**
- d-tubocurarine - ganglionic blockage, causing hypotension. and bronchospasm = histamine release
- pancuronium - hypertension/tachy; long duration, slow onset 
- atracurium - fast and shorter duration than pancuronium, histamine release = **hypotension, bronchospasm, and seizure risk bc of metabolites being physiologically active**
	- ==basically eliminated in this Hofmann elimination without organs involved .. like in plasma== 
	- can be useful for ppl with kidney/liver dysfunction 
- vecuronium  - **common; faster onset + shorter duration than pancuronium, minimal CV effects**
- rocuronium - **common; fastest onset of action of these guys; intermediate duration**
- ultimately nondepol drug interactions - 
	- ==reversed by anticholinesterase agents like neostigmine==
	- ==enhanced by the general anesthetics and antibiotics== 

==depolarizing - like ACH similarities - like 2 achs stitched together== 
	- these are agonists of nAChR that initially ==**depolarize skeletal muscle but prevent resolarization**==
	- blockage with ==depol nmbas is similar to **anticholinesterases.**==
	==- held in NMJ and can't be cleared out = **phase 1 blockade** ,initial period of muscle fasciculaitions, constantly depolarized and firing off== 
- succinylcholine - is a substrate for plasma cholinesterases - **to break this down, so the mech of action is very short, so you have to give a lot** - quick onset, short duration like in emergency cases... 30-60 seconds. quick on, quick off.
	- SE: **hyperkalemia (arrhythmias, etc) and malignant hyperthermia (strong genetic component.) - release of some k+ bc sodium comes in, K+ goes out of cells** ; for ppl with burns, they would tend to get more nicotinic receptors outside of muscles
		- release more and more K+ -> for injuries patients of trauma = hyperkalemia 
	- ==phase 2 block = resting potential repolarizes but remains desensitized.== 
		- occurs with longterm infusion or repeated succinyl choline boluses 
		- ==nicotinic receptors are desensitized and unresponsive to further agonist stimulation==
		- ==you would try to avoid this!== 
	- ==possible to reverse a phase 2 block by acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. = debatable, honestly just let them metabolize it== 
	- but acetylcholinesterase inhibitors you can't use in phase 1 block 
	- **duration can be prolonged too in ppl with abnormal pseudoholinesterase gene ):**  = prolonged paralysis 
both non-depol + depol = respiratory depression, no CNS effects
- but non-depol - longr time longer onset
- depol - veery brief and quick 

NMBAs = neuromusc blocking agents
- only under very controlled conditions as adjunts to gen anesthesia
- profound muscle relaxations and reduce inhaled general anesthetic required, increasing the safety risk for anesthetcis
	- **don't produce loss of consciousness, analgesia, or anesthesia**
	- simply block motor impulse. 
- target for NMBA = **nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs** clustered at the NMJ , the motor endplate. 

by releasing ach they're binding to the nicotinic receptor, and then opening their channels to sodium and letting it in 
- causing na+ influx into the cell, then reaching the threshold depolarization 
- voltage gated na channels will **propogate** this action potential to t-tubules, where they activate L-type Ca2+ to inc intracellular ca via excitation contraction coupling with gating to ryanodine receptor inside the SR + contractions 
you need to clear all the ACH out of the junction to reset junction for resting potential 
- you have to hydrolyze by acetylcholinesterase which allows potential to return and respond again 
if you keep it depolarized stat, then the threshold potential will continue to rise, not stable, 
- and **if you keep the ach there long enough, you desensitize these nicotinic receptors**
- similar to organophosphate toxicity bc they desensitize this 

most anesthesia ppls will be using the peripheral nerve stimulators to escavate the patient so they can breathe on their own 
- muscle contraction responses to nerve stimulation is used in monitoring the relaxation 
- lines of 4 = tall ones = **this mans train of 4  = 4 successive pulses seen on pollicis, put on nerve to stimulate, so you can get the contraction**
	- this means that there's no drug nor paralysis 
- ==nondepol block = we see the train of 4 fade.== 
	- **measure ratio of first vs fourth burst (usually getting smaller) and if it's at a certain amount it means they're sufficiency paralysed** 
- succinylcholate
	- ==we get a **smaller reduced response in phase 1 blockade, so no fade, just shorter 4 lines**==
	- ==but if you get phase 2 blckage,  then you get a fade again.== 

electroshock therapy 
- succinylcholine used to prevent trauma durin seizures induced by this. 

--- 
spasmolytic agents - spasticity = inc in muscle tone and inc muscle weakness, so nerve to muscles continually activated = > stiffness, interfereing with movement. 
	- commonly presents with cerbral palsy. + MS or stroke injury 
	- highest centers of CNS involved
	- stretch reflex arc - 
		- sensory neuron wrapped around muscle spindle that's activated in response to stretching 
		- activates alpha motoneurons connected to this fibers from that same muscle to return to resting length 
		- response to muscle stretch is a contraction 
		==- **thought that hyperexcitability of alpha motoneurons in spinal cord are responsible** = this is whats treated in spasmolytics== 
	- most of these are CNS depressants + sedating 
central-acting spasmolytic agents: 
- ==diazepam - actions of GABA on GABA-A, this is **not an agonist, but simply helps this receptor be better...** = GABA-a is an ion channel, positive modulator==
	- requires presynaptic GABa release, and when GABA's binding, it will hyperpolarize the neurons
	- reducing all types of spasms
	- causes sedation at therapeutic doses 
	- gaba-a will be ==facilitatating hyperpolarization of cl- atoms which will quiet down the activity== 
- ==baclofen - block **gaba-b** as an AGONIST = this is  a GCPR==
	- when GABA-b is activate, they would suppress NT release... 
	- ==but these specifically **will shut off excitatory NT glutamate release**==
	- influencing the potassium channel to go out , making the potential weird
	- very effective and causes less sdation + helped to absorb orally + also with catheter... 
	- ==**but abrupt withdrawl can cause seizures = ifyou make that inhibitory tone all the time, body tries to compensate by making too much glutamate**==
- dantrolene
	- reduces excitatin-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle
	- ==**prevents release of cyt calcium by blocking the RYANODINE receptor**==
	- black box = hepatitis/hepatotoxicity
	- for non-ambulatory pts with severe cases... avoid the non-dihydropyridine ca channel blockers... can cause cv collapse when combined
	- **first line treatment for malignant hyperthermia, which is caused by rampant ca influx or activation**
- botulinum toxin 
	- zn dependent protease from clostridium botulinum 
	- ==blocking ach by preventing dock and fusion with **cleavage of SNAP-25 part of SNARE complex** = block ACH release locally== 
	- flaccid paralysis 
	- used in short term treatment of facial wrinkels
	- dysphagia, muscle weakness, severe headache.

| Phase I blockade is actually ==prolonged in the presence of a cholinesterase inhibitor by increasing acetylcholine concentration==; thus, in this situation there would be two depolarizing agents present (succinylcholine and acetylcholine) and since their actions cannot be terminated by acetylcholinesterase, their affects would be prolonged. Phase I blockade is produced by depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, which actually cause an initial depolarization of the muscle cell membrane by opening the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor but act by preventing repolarization of the membrane since they are insensitive to acetylcholinesterases in the neuromuscular junction. Due to this mode of action, patients do often exhibit initial muscle fasciculations prior to relaxation. Abnormal/atypical pseudocholinesterase alleles, which are generally hypomorphic (loss of function) alleles, result in prolonged duration of phase I blockade as the breakdown and clearance of the depolarizing agent (e.g. succinylcholine) is prolonged. The correct answer is C. |     |
