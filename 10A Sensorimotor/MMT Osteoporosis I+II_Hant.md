**always read the worse of the scores** when its like forearm v hip v other part of body - note that if one part is t score bad, she's osteoporosis 
- pay attention to the 1/3 score, the total score for vertebrae, and the femoral neck or total; stuff for the other scores. 
- osteopenia = -1 to -2.5 

recall
bone has organic and inorganic component
organic matrix = collagen type 1, osteoid
inorganic = 70%. of bone weight is ca phosphate , carbonate, mg, fluoride
types of bone
- trabecular = spongelike, large SA, high turnover rate = vertebrae 
	- - surface resorption = **osteoclast cause trabecular bone loss by erosding the many surface areas **
	- bone get thinner 
- cortical = compact bone, low turnover = the long bons mainly 
	- lost by endocortical resorption and **tunneling, inc porosity and making it more spongey**

bone quality - 
deterinants of bone strength BMD - bone mineral density 
- mass
- geometry
- microarchitecture (trabecular v cortical)
- material properties 

bone remodding 
- rankl will activate osteoclast to chew up bone and osteoblast lines the cells 
- bone turnover = inc resorption, dec bone mass, inc cortical porosity, trabecular disruption, reduced mineralization 
	- weaked = osteopenic bone
	- osteoporatic bone = weak bone
- resorption = formation in later in life, 20s etc.
- early in life formation > resotion 
- after 50 resorption > formation 

osteporosis 
affects entire skeleton = systemic
inc risk of fracture, but a silent dz until the fragility fracture occurs 
- no pain!
- common  + serious , and easy to dx bc bone density testing 

happen mostly in spine, hip, wrist
- most common is in vertebrae!!! 2/3rds are asymptomatic but with hieght loss, back pain, dec lung capacity 
- 1/2 patients become non-ambulatory after hip fracture
	- many die bc of DVTs since they're immoble 

fragility fracutre = happens from standing height or less, not sustained as a result of trauma 

hip fractures
- dsability in 1/2 
- long term nursing care
- inc mortability of DVT

vertebral 
- occur all the time and inc risk of other fractures
- kyphosis , turns into restrictive lung dz 
- acute and chronic pain 
- height loss
- strong predictor of subsequent fractures in vertebral deformities

an osteoporotic spine = has a lot of kyphosis (can be bc of many issues but recognize to look into it)
suspicion 
- acute onset back pain
- vertebral pt tenderness
- sacral tenderness
- pain with sitting
- DXA img
- loss of height of 2 cm or reported loss of 4+cm

morphometric fracturs = incidentally picked up on imaging. 
risk factors of osteoporosis 
- female
- postmenopausal
- caucasian or asian 
- small body <127 lbs
- family hx or fractures as adults
- inactive lifestyle
- cig smoking, alc use
- inadequate ca intake
- **meds = glucocorticoids, heparin, thyroid supp, aromatase inhib, depo-provera, seizure meds, ppi, ssris, tzds**
	- we induce many many **secondary osteoporosis!!!** ): thin bones happen out of this 
- men with it are underdiagnosed, lack of awareness is similar ... 
- woman's disease perception 
- 1/4 men 50+ suffer a fracture, and then inc of suffering more

glucocorticoids = cause osteoporosis in both men and women 
- initial rapid loss like 1 yr 
- osteoblast apoptosis 
- osteocytes decrease in viability 
- androgens decrease 
- ca resorption and absorption decrease 
	- pTH inc 
	- so resorption inc with a net loss of bone density 

GIOP = glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis 
- secondary osteoporosis 
- bone loss rapid 
- fractures common up to 50% of patient son chronic steroids 
- **fractures occur at higher BMD than typical osteoporosis patients** 
- risk of fracture with steroid use is inc w/ increasing doses of steroids
- fracture risk in**c as early as 3 months** after initiating steroids. 
- dx and therapeutic challenge 
- patient populations 
	- young pre-menopausal women 
	- men = not targets 
- underlying causes are rare diverse and req testing
- response to regular therapy for osteoporosis may not be adequate if the underlying thing is not addressed  
	- metabolic abnormality
	- anemia
	- hypogonadism, 
	- hypercalciuria
	- cushing
	- vitamin d insufficiency
	- prolonged hyperthyroid state
	- hyperparathyroidism 
	- malignancy like multiple myeloma 
	- gastric bypass 
	- rheumatoid arthritis 
	- anorexia 
dx = BMD assessment is gold standard 
- clinical dx of osteoporosis = made in presence of ffragility fracture **without BMD measurement**
- BMD assessment:
- DXA = dual energy x ray absorptionmetry = **precise measure at clinically relevant skeleta sites**
	- bone densitometry 
	- measures bone mineral content in grams and surface area cm2 
	- gold std = BMD g/cm2 
	- measures hip and spine (+- measure non-dominant forearm)
	- compares pt BMD with that of young adult sex matched reference population (**t-score**)
		- for postmenopausal women and men 50+ y/o 
			- 1+ normal 
			- -1 to -2.5 osteopenia 
			- < -2.5 osteoporosis 
		- note = **fracture risk doubles with every decrease in t-score/SD decrease**
	- follow up DXA??? = not more frequently than yearly, inhalation of steroids is an exception 
		- do every it 6 months if that's the case 
		- official thoughts on position = measure one year after starting of Rx to **document response**
		- stable BMD on the Rx = success 
		- medicare ): no more freq than every 23 months  
	- compares pt bMD with that of an age-, sex-, and ethnicity matched reference. = **z score**
		- **premenopausal** women and men <50 y/o 
			- more than -2.0 = **normal bone mass for age**
			- < -2.0 low bone mass for age 
			- suggestion of 2ndary cause for osteoporosis 
	- **t- and z-scores are the number of SD that patient BMD differs from ref population** 
	- bone density testing is done for 3 reasons 
		1. to dx osteoporosis
		2. to predict fracture risk 
		3. to monitor therapy 
		4. if they fall into the recommendations: 65+ women, 70+ men, women with hx of fragility fractures, all postmenopausal women with least one risk factor, adults with dz or medication hx associated with bone loss 
- quantitative computerized tomography = qct = measures volumetric bone density of spine and hip 
	- can analyze the cortical and trabecular bone separately 
	- helps individual pts do **therapeutic response tracking to therapy, not screening**
	- also costly and high radiation exposure 
- peripheral measurements - inc ultrasounds, peripheral dual energy xray absorptiometry DXA , , pQCT of heel, radius or hand 
	- can help predict fracture (screening)
- FRAX = fracture risk assessment tool 
	- bc BMD is specific but not sensitive for fracture risk 
	- addition of clinical risk factors to BMD to determine fracture risk  
	- age, sex, weight , height etc
		- estimates hip fracture, major osteoporotic fracture spine/forearm/hip/shoulder
50% of fractures happen with osteopenia
- T score -1 to -2.5 
- to determine prob at 10 yrs of patient sustaining either hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture
	- or patients with low bone mass
	- treatment-neive patients 
	- recommendation = intervention at following 10 yr fracture risk thresholds
		- osteoporotic fracture 20+% 
		- hip fracture 3+% 
- can't be applied to patients on treatment 
- tool is online = femoral neck BMD etc. 
FRAX calcuator = things to consider 
- prior fracture 
- exposure to higher dose oral gucocorticoids
- duration of t2dm 

TBS - trabecular bone score 
- texture index!!! evaluates pixel gray level variations in lumbar spine DXA img 
- indirect measure of bone microarchitecture
	- relates to 3d bone characteristics: 
		- trabecular number
		- trabecular separation 
		- connectivity density 
- high tbs = strong, facture-resistant microarchitecture
- low tbs = weak 
- 1.35+ normal 
- lower than that = degrade


management approach to osteoporosis 
- in adolesence = key bone mass peak 
- **we need to obtain ideal bone health early in life = 60% growth in adolescence**
	- focus on ca/vita d, weight bearing exercise, high impact exercise, caloric intake 
- treatment/prevention options
	- weight bearing exercise = loading ur bones 
		- make sure you talk to your doctor first 
		- supporting own body weight against gravity like walking, running, hiking, dancing jumping and climbing stairs 
	- fall prevention 
	- stop smoking/excessive etoh 
	- pt/OT referral
	- daily 
		- ca+ vita D
		- estrogen 
		- raloxifene/evista 
		- calcitonin 
		- teriparatide/forteo
		- abalparatide/tymios
	- weekly 
		- alendronate
		- risedronate
	- monthly 
		- risedronate
		- ibandronate
		- romosozumab
	- quarterly 
		- ibandronateboniva
	- biannually 
		- denosumab
	- yearly 
		- zoledronic acid 
- fall prevention - use handrail in stairs etc

calcium + vitamin d
- main source of ca should be from diet 
- milk
women under 50 
- 1000 mg every day 
- 50-over 1200 mg per day , 800-1000 iu daily 
---
initiate pharmacotherapy 
in any of the following - 
- fracture
- t-score <-2.5 at spine, femoral neck, total hip 
- farx ... t score bt -1 and -2.5 , 10 year prob of any fracture 20+%... 3+% hip fracture

pharmacologic therapy options 
- antiresorptive = dec osteoclast activity 
	- bisphosphonates = alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate = both prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteo and glucocorticoid induced treatment. **osteoclast inhibitrs, avidly binding to the bone**
		- risedronate is good for both prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid osteo
		- SEs: gi intol, compliance issues, renal toxicity 
		- IV long term SEs: hypocalcemia, acute rxns, renal tox as well 
		- will reduce fracture risk and inc bmd in general 
		- good for pts who have fractured in the past 1 year 
		- osteonecrosis of jaw
	- zoledronic acid  - is good for both prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid osteo
	- denosumab = treats post-menopausal osteo
		- SE: skin infections , osteonecrosis of jaw
		- RANKL antibody - blocks binding to RANK
		- inhibition of osteclasts, dec bone resorption and inc bone density 
		- reduction of all risk of fractures - need to get **treated every 6 months otherwise you get rapid bone loss, need to continue doing it**
	- estrogen = **prevention** of postmenopausal osteo
		- SE: dvt, breast cancer, stroke, CAD, uterine bleeding 
		- good to prevent the osteoporosis 
		- weigh the risk bc of CV events
	- SERMs raloxifene = prevent and treats post-menopausal osteo
		- SE: hot flashses, DVT, stroke 
		- can help prevent and treat, binds to the e=receptor
		- some trials show that it reducs ER+ invasive breast cancers. 
		- **antiresorptive, only shown to reduce vertebral fracture, not the non-vertebral fracture rates in spite of inc bone mineral density in both spine and hip**
	- nasal calcitonin = treatment of postmenopausal osteo = annalgesic effect 
		- nasal irritation 
		- calcitonin salmon - inc spine and hip BMD
		- small effect with reduction of fracture risk 
		- but mainly for analgesic/endorphin effect
		- SE: **especially inc in risk of malignancy, like prostate cancer in men and neoplasms**
	- strontium ranelate
- anabolic agent = inc resorption and formation but more of the formation increaser 
	- anabolic agent = stimulates new bone formation , inc BMD, reduces risk for fracuter = once a day PTH 
	- teriparatide  =  post-menopausal osteo treatment, along with treating glucocorticoid osteo
		- SE: subq daily injections, hypercalcemia, ?? osteosarcoma - 
		- don't use for risk of getting osteosarcoma
		- pagets dz, inc of alk phos, hx of metastasis to bone? 
			- who gets bone building drug: **ppl with multiple risk factors for fraccture and many vertebral ones**
			- BEST for pt who fractures in spite of bisphosphonate therapy 
			- timing is important = low t score pts, start on this up-front. other first line stuff like bisphosphonate first can cause delayed response 
	- abaloparatide - PTH , indicatd specifically for post-menopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture
		- they should get ca and vitamin d if dietary intake is inadequate
		- CI: orthostatic hypotension, hypercalcemia
		- hypercalciuria, urolithiasis
		- common AEs - hypercalciuria, dizziness, n, headache, palpitations, fatigue, 
- osteoanabolic agent = anabolic and antiresorptive 
	- romosozumab  - humanized monoclonal antibody acting as sclerostin inhibitor, indicated for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture 
		- or for those who are intolerant to other available therapies 
		- CI: **major adverse cardiac events = MI or stroke**, hypersensitivity, hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of jaw, atypical femoral fracture 
	- sclerostin = **glycoprotein made by osteocytes, key inhibitor of Wnt signalling pathway**
		- sclerostin binds lrp -5/6 and prevents wnt from binding to frizzled family receptor and lrp co-receptors 
		- **leads to down reg of canonical wnt signaling pathway** 
		- end = **inhibition of osteo*blas*t diff and function** and decreased bone formation 
		- 

osteoporotic bone = resorptive cavities, loss of connectivity (bone breaking straight up)
antiresorptive = fills in resorptive cavity, increasing mineralization 
anabolic = makes osteoid itself, increasing connectivity 

atypical femur fractures
- further down than we expect
- transverse rather than spiral, 
- may begin with stress rxn or stress fracture, which might be bilateral
- prodromal pain in thigh/groin 
- **often with LONGTERM use of steroids or estrogen, bisphosphates**
- if you constantly suppress bone turnover , there's atypical femur fractures. = corticoid reaction 

osteonecrosis of jaw
- seen with **bisphosphonates and denosumab**
- srs= decreased metabolic support to the bony tissue results in bone necrosis
- higher risk of this in patients
	- **aminobisphosphonates compared to non-amino**
	- taking drug IV
	- taking drug related to malignancy 
happens invasive dental procedures and also spontaneously 
- disease will **progress in spite of cessation**
- encourage dental procdures prior to starting therapy 

drug holiday - 
- not sure, but long term effects of bisphosphonate therapy , consideration given after 3-5 yrs of sucess meaning
	- stable/improving bmd, t score<-2 
	- no fractures
- not appropriate in pts taking certain op mds due to rapid off-set of effects when stopped 
- reeval bmd every 1-2 yrs and re-eval risk/benefit balance 
- may use BTM if have been done througout therapy 

imagine. = woman with osteo dx age 57 with t score -2.6 no risk factors, treated with alendronate for 5 yrs stable bmd, consider a drug holiday at least until more decline or fracture

moderate inc fracture risk 
- for 8 years, treat 5-10 years then drug holdiya 
- for 3-5 yrs or until significant loss of bmd/fracture

high risk 
- -3.0 dx 10 years ago, 2 in height loss, hx of vertebra compression fracture.9 yrs ago 
- 10 yrs treatment 
- drug holiday 1-2 yrs until significant loss of BMd/fracture
- consider **raloxifene or teriparatide during drug holiday**
