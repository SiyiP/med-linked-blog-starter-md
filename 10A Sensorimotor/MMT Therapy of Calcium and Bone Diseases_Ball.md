therapy of ca and bone dz - 
be familiar with mechanisms + how things impact bone resorbsion 

hypercalcemia 
- 12 mg/dL+ calcium 
- most commonly due to hyperparathyroidism, PTH high 
- also with bone metastasis and many other conditions
symptoms of
- fatigue, weak, anorex, depression, anx, cog dysfunction , constipation 
- renal symptoms = polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia
- -> acute pancreatitis+arrhythmias if severe
- chronic hypercalcemia = ca depo into soft tissues like BVs and kidnesy 
TREAT:
- first line saline dilution and loop diuretics (furosemide, bumtandide, torsemide) to remove urine w ca... 
	- 24-48 hrs 
	- loop diuretics stop in case of electrolyte abnormalities like K+ and Mg,,, CI in pts with allergy to sulfas 
	- saline = CI in electrolyte abnormalities, fluid overload, renal insuffficency/CHF
- in case of renal insufficiency, use hemodialysis + calcitonin (blocks bone resorption, reduces renal tubular resorption of ca) + glucocorticoids(reduce GI calcium absorption)
	- calcitonin SE facial flushing, n/v, allergies is the only CI 
- bisphosphonates = block bone resorption 
	- pamidronate = 2 days = SE of fever, skeletal pain, fatigue, and CI in renal insufficiency 
	- zoledronate =  1-2 days = SE of fever, skeletal pain, fatigue, and CI in renal insufficiency 
- plicamycin = blocks PTH action, works in 3-5 days, and CI in renal/liver dz or pregnancy


hypocalcemia - <8.5 mg/dL
- happens in parathyroidectomy/thyroidectomy , rapid reduction in sr calcium 
- chronically, consider vita D deficiency 
- also results from bariatric surgery 
- hallmark syndromes: **tetany**, paresthesia, muscle cramp, laryngospasm, but chronically with depression, anxiety, memb loss, confusion 
- **chvostek sign** = tapping on facial nerve anterior to ear -> facial twitching 
- **trousseau sign** = inflate bp cuff above systolic bp for 3 min, see if you can get a carpal spasm 
- skin = dry, puffy, coarse with hyperpig, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis 
- dental = early dev of hypoplasia, and failure of teeth 
- CV = **hypotension**, CHF, **prolonged QT, arrythmias, bradycardia can all occur**
- **hypocalcemia alone can impair insulin release**
TREAT:
- ca supplements
- vitamin D 

hyperphosphatemia 
- 4.5+ mg/dL phosphate 
- CKD in patients and AKIs due to dec glomerular filtration and with hypoparathyroidism 
- ACUTE: GI disturbance, lethargy, urinary tract obstruction, sometimes seizures
- chronic  = "red eye + " pruitus 
- signs = Ca-phos precipitates in arteries, joints, soft tissues, viscera
	- can lead to necrosis 
TREAT:  phosphate binders to dec absorption of phosphorus from GI tract 

hypophosphatemia 
- less than <2.4, but symptoms come up <1 
- irritability, apprehension, weakness, numbness, paresthesia, confusion 
- severe: seizures/coma 
- **initial response -> hypercalcemia / hypercalceuria**
- seen in vitamin D def / rickets/osteomalacia
- metabolic encephalopathy + cerebral dysfunction 
- impaired contractility of <3, ATP depletion results in this and resp failure. CHF too 
- prox muscle weakness, dysphagia, and GI atony, rhabdomyolysis 
- hemolysis, reduction in phagocytes + granulocytes + dfective clot retration 
TREAT: Iv phosphorus salt supplments

hyperparathyroidism 
- causes hypercalcemia
- primary 
	- parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia/cancers
- secondary
	- chronic renal failure
	- TREAT: cinacalcet = calcimimetic which allosterically activate calcium sensing receptor CaSR in parathyroid , turning off PTH senthesis 
- SE: severe osteoporosis + osteopenia, fractures,  kidney stones, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, nervous system complaints 
- TREAT: surg to remove parathyroid gland, treatment of renal failure 

hypoparathyroidism 
- caused by inadvertent removal during thryoid surg, autoimmune, inborn error
- PTH treatment = teriparatide = recombinant 

agents affecting mineral ion homeostasis/bone turnover. 
osteoclast resorbs bone, letting phosphate and ca into bloodstream 
osteoblasts lay down new bone 

bisphosphonates
- compounds that coordinate with calcium = automatically targetting the bone, stays inside the bone for a while
