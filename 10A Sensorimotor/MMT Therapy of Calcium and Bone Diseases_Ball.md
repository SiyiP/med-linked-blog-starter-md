therapy of ca and bone dz - 
be familiar with mechanisms + how things impact bone resorbsion 

EDTA = emergency chelator for lower serum ca levels in hypercalcemia 


hypercalcemia 
- 12 mg/dL+ calcium 
- ==most commonly due to hyperparathyroidism, PTH high== 
- ==also with bone metastasis and many other conditions==
symptoms of
- ==fatigue, weak, anorex, depression, anx, cog dysfunction , constipation== 
- renal symptoms = ==polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia==
- -> acute pancreatitis+arrhythmias if severe
- chronic hypercalcemia = ca depo into soft tissues like BVs and kidnesy 
TREAT:
- ==first line saline dilution and loop diuretics (furosemide, bumtandide, torsemide) to remove urine w ca...== 
	- 24-48 hrs 
	- ==loop diuretics stop in case of electrolyte abnormalities like K+ and Mg,,, CI in pts with allergy to sulfas== 
	- saline = CI in electrolyte abnormalities, fluid overload, renal insuffficency/CHF
- in case of ==renal insufficiency, use hemodialysis + calcitonin== (blocks bone resorption, reduces renal tubular resorption of ca) ==+ glucocorticoids(reduce GI calcium absorption)==
	- ==calcitonin SE facial flushing, n/v, allergies is the only CI== 
- ==bisphosphonates = block bone resorption== 
	- ==pamidronate = 2 days = SE of fever, skeletal pain, fatigue, and CI in renal insufficiency== 
	- ==zoledronate =  1-2 days = SE of fever, skeletal pain, fatigue, and CI in renal insufficiency== 
- ==plicamycin = blocks PTH action==, works in 3-5 days, and CI in renal/liver dz or pregnancy


hypocalcemia - <8.5 mg/dL
- happens in ==parathyroidectomy/thyroidectomy== , rapid reduction in sr calcium 
- chronically, ==consider vita D deficiency== 
- also ==results from bariatric surgery== 
- hallmark syndromes: **==tetany==**, paresthesia, muscle cramp, laryngospasm, but ==chronically with depression, anxiety, memb loss, confusion== 
- ==**chvostek sign** = tapping on facial nerve anterior to ear -> facial twitching== 
- ==**trousseau sign** = inflate bp cuff above systolic bp for 3 min, see if you can get a carpal spasm== 
- skin = ==dry, puffy, coarse with hyperpig, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis== 
- dental = early dev of hypoplasia, and failure of teeth 
- ==CV = **hypotension**, CHF, **prolonged QT, arrythmias, bradycardia can all occur**==
- ==**hypocalcemia alone can impair insulin release**==
TREAT:
- ca supplements
- vitamin D 

==hyperphosphatemia== 
- 4.5+ mg/dL phosphate 
- ==CKD in patients and AKIs due to dec glomerular filtration and with hypoparathyroidism== 
- ==ACUTE: GI disturbance, lethargy, urinary tract obstruction, sometimes seizures==
- chronic  = =="red eye + " pruitus== 
- signs = ==Ca-phos precipitates in arteries, joints, soft tissues, viscera==
	- can lead to ==necrosis== 
TREAT:  ==phosphate binders== to dec absorption of phosphorus from GI tract 

hypophosphatemia 
- less than <2.4, but symptoms come up <1 
- ==irritability, apprehension, weakness, numbness, paresthesia, confusion== 
- ==severe: seizures/coma== 
- ==**initial response -> hypercalcemia / hypercalceuria**==
- seen in ==vitamin D def / rickets/osteomalacia==
- ==metabolic encephalopathy + cerebral dysfunction== 
- impaired contractility of <3, ATP depletion results in this and ==resp failur==e. CHF too 
- prox muscle weakness, dysphagia, and GI atony, rhabdomyolysis 
- ==hemolysis, reduction in phagocytes + granulocytes + defective clot retration== 
TREAT: Iv phosphorus salt supplments

hyperparathyroidism 
- ==causes hypercalcemia==
- primary 
	- ==parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia/cancers==
- secondary
	- ==chronic renal failure==
	- ==TREAT: cinacalcet = calcimimetic which allosterically activate calcium sensing receptor CaSR in parathyroid , turning off PTH senthesis== 
- SE: ==severe osteoporosis + osteopenia==, fractures,  kidney stones, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, nervous system complaints 
- TREAT: surg to remove parathyroid gland, treatment of renal failure 

hypoparathyroidism 
- caused by inadvertent removal during thryoid surg, autoimmune, inborn error
- ==PTH treatment = teriparatide = recombinant== = strongest anabolic effect on bone but stop after 1.5 yrs bc start making more resorption than formation 

agents affecting mineral ion homeostasis/bone turnover. 
osteoclast resorbs bone, letting phosphate and ca into bloodstream 
osteoblasts lay down new bone 

bisphosphonates
- ==compounds that coordinate with calcium = automatically targetting the bone, stays inside the bone for a while== 
- ==treats - osteoporosis, paget's dz of bone, bone metastasis + multiple myeloma + other bone fragility== 
in ==osteoporosis + pagets==
- ==alendronate + risedronate== = most effective amino bisphosphonate
- if theres ==digestive issues, IV zoledronate used==
	- so they're told to stay upright with the drug 
- used in general to mod progression f bone cancer/skeletal metastasis in esp breast cancer - 
- also reduce fracture rates in kids with osteogenesis imperfecta
- ==teriparatide = for refractory dz== 
- ==selective e receptor modifiers raloxifene = administered in postmenopausal women instead of bisphosphonates== 
==SE: necrosis of jaw!!== osteonecosis of jaw, typically seen and scary with cancer IV malignancy treatment
- GI - ==reflux==, ulcers, esophagitis, 
- msk = pain severe happens in like months/years it stays in bone for so long. 
- renal = bisphosphonates not for anyone ith creatine clerance below 30 and 35
- ==ocular = blurred vision, itis, etc==
- ==flu like symptoms too 24-75 hrs post infusion== 
- afib + atypical femur fractures
	- ==**drugs kill osteoCLAST, so normal remodeling is slowed, and there's spiral atypical fractures. more bone mineral density just not as sound**==
- hypocalcemia 

==non amino bisphosphonates== 
1. ==etidronate==
2. ==clodronate== 
- basically metabilized to compound==s replacing the terminal moiety of ATP in osteoCLASTs, if you compete with ATP, this will cause osteoclast death== 
amino-bisphosphonates
1. alendronate
2. ibandronate
3. risedronate
4. zoledronate
==inhibits the **farnesyl diphosphate transferase FPPS**, blocking protein prenylation onto cysteine in proteins , **causing protein to NOT be trafficked to the membrane, so osteoclast acitivity is low**==
inibits osteoclasts and resorption of bone 

==denosumab==
- ==human monoclonal antibody binding to RANKL, sequestiering it away from the osteoclasts, blocking this== 
- used with ca and vitamin d to reduce bone loss w prostate + breast cancer therapies/metastasis 
- ==indicated for postmenopausal women wit osteoporosis at high fracture risk== 
- ==musct be used with ca and vitamin d to reduce bone loss==
- given 2x a year IV
- ==SE: osteonecrosi of jaw,== inc cancer/severe infections, 
- inc infections + eczema 
- CI: hypocalcemia + might see rapid bone loss when terminated 

==strontium ranlate== - more historical
- ==inc osteoblastogenesis== both in and in vivo... 
- strontium are exhanged for ca in bone minerals and remains in the bone for eyars
==inc osteoblast and dec osteoclast== 
- used for osteoporosis
- ==SE: n/diarrhea, but there's CV risks like blood clot== 

estrogens
- ==estradiol== too - agonist for ==ER//// ligand activated transcription factor==
- ==**this will reduce the bone resorbing action of PTH**==
- this prevents postmenopausla osteoporosis more
- used with progestin for hormone replacement, dec bone loss in postmenopausla women 
- SE: clots + CV 
- CI - breast/endometrial canc er

SERMS
- ==raloxifene = ER in bone, antagonist in breast + endometrium== 
- against breast cnacer + osteoporosis
==SE: menopause== 
less risk of endometrial cancr 

==anti-sclerostin antibody = romosozumab==
- ==sclerostin = secreted glycoprotein which **inhibits oseoblast fomation by inhibiting the Wnt signling pathway**==
	- this is ==specifically against osteoblasts, not clast== 
	- inc wnt signalling in osteoblast 
- this drug sequesters sclerostin = making the blocked inhibitory effct of sclerostin on blast prolif 
- ==SE: black box. = CI, stroke, CV death== 

bone mneral desnity = change relative to a baseline
