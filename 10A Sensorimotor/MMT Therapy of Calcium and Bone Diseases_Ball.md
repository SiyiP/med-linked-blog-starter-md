therapy of ca and bone dz - 
be familiar with mechanisms + how things impact bone resorbsion 

hypercalcemia 
- 12 mg/dL+ calcium 
- ==most commonly due to hyperparathyroidism, PTH high== 
- also with bone metastasis and many other conditions
symptoms of
- fatigue, weak, anorex, depression, anx, cog dysfunction , constipation 
- renal symptoms = polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia
- -> acute pancreatitis+arrhythmias if severe
- chronic hypercalcemia = ca depo into soft tissues like BVs and kidnesy 
TREAT:
- first line saline dilution and loop diuretics (furosemide, bumtandide, torsemide) to remove urine w ca... 
	- 24-48 hrs 
	- loop diuretics stop in case of electrolyte abnormalities like K+ and Mg,,, CI in pts with allergy to sulfas 
	- saline = CI in electrolyte abnormalities, fluid overload, renal insuffficency/CHF
- in case of renal insufficiency, use hemodialysis + calcitonin (blocks bone resorption, reduces renal tubular resorption of ca) + glucocorticoids(reduce GI calcium absorption)
	- calcitonin SE facial flushing, n/v, allergies is the only CI 
- bisphosphonates = block bone resorption 
	- pamidronate = 2 days = SE of fever, skeletal pain, fatigue, and CI in renal insufficiency 
	- zoledronate =  1-2 days = SE of fever, skeletal pain, fatigue, and CI in renal insufficiency 
- plicamycin = blocks PTH action, works in 3-5 days, and CI in renal/liver dz or pregnancy


hypocalcemia - <8.5 mg/dL
- happens in parathyroidectomy/thyroidectomy , rapid reduction in sr calcium 
- chronically, consider vita D deficiency 
- also results from bariatric surgery 
- hallmark syndromes: **tetany**, paresthesia, muscle cramp, laryngospasm, but chronically with depression, anxiety, memb loss, confusion 
- **chvostek sign** = tapping on facial nerve anterior to ear -> facial twitching 
- **trousseau sign** = inflate bp cuff above systolic bp for 3 min, see if you can get a carpal spasm 
- skin = dry, puffy, coarse with hyperpig, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis 
- dental = early dev of hypoplasia, and failure of teeth 
- CV = **hypotension**, CHF, **prolonged QT, arrythmias, bradycardia can all occur**
- **hypocalcemia alone can impair insulin release**
TREAT:
- ca supplements
- vitamin D 

hyperphosphatemia 
- 4.5+ mg/dL phosphate 
- CKD in patients and AKIs due to dec glomerular filtration and with hypoparathyroidism 
- ACUTE: GI disturbance, lethargy, urinary tract obstruction, sometimes seizures
- chronic  = "red eye + " pruitus 
- signs = Ca-phos precipitates in arteries, joints, soft tissues, viscera
	- can lead to necrosis 
TREAT:  phosphate binders to dec absorption of phosphorus from GI tract 

hypophosphatemia 
- less than <2.4, but symptoms come up <1 
- irritability, apprehension, weakness, numbness, paresthesia, confusion 
- severe: seizures/coma 
- **initial response -> hypercalcemia / hypercalceuria**
- seen in vitamin D def / rickets/osteomalacia
- metabolic encephalopathy + cerebral dysfunction 
- impaired contractility of <3, ATP depletion results in this and resp failure. CHF too 
- prox muscle weakness, dysphagia, and GI atony, rhabdomyolysis 
- hemolysis, reduction in phagocytes + granulocytes + dfective clot retration 
TREAT: Iv phosphorus salt supplments

hyperparathyroidism 
- causes hypercalcemia
- primary 
	- parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia/cancers
- secondary
	- chronic renal failure
	- TREAT: cinacalcet = calcimimetic which allosterically activate calcium sensing receptor CaSR in parathyroid , turning off PTH senthesis 
- SE: severe osteoporosis + osteopenia, fractures,  kidney stones, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, nervous system complaints 
- TREAT: surg to remove parathyroid gland, treatment of renal failure 

hypoparathyroidism 
- caused by inadvertent removal during thryoid surg, autoimmune, inborn error
- PTH treatment = teriparatide = recombinant 

agents affecting mineral ion homeostasis/bone turnover. 
osteoclast resorbs bone, letting phosphate and ca into bloodstream 
osteoblasts lay down new bone 

bisphosphonates
- compounds that coordinate with calcium = automatically targetting the bone, stays inside the bone for a while 
- treats - osteoporosis, paget's dz of bone, bone metastasis + multiple myeloma + other bone fragility 
in osteoporosis + pagets
- alendronate + risedronate = most effective amino bisphosphonate
- if theres digestive issues, IV zoledronate used
	- so they're told to stay upright with the drug 
- used in general to mod progression f bone cancer/skeletal metastasis in esp breast cancer - 
- also reduce fracture rates in kids with osteogenesis imperfecta
- teriparatide = refractory dz 
- selective e receptor modifiers raloxifene = administered in postmenopausla women instead of bisphosphonates 
SE: necrosis of jaw!! osteonecosis of jaw, typically seen and scary with cancer IV malignancy treatment
- GI - reflux, ulcers, esophagitis, 
- msk = pain severe happens in like months/years it stays in bone for so long. 
- renal = bisphosphonates not for anyone ith creatine clerance below 30 and 35
- ocular = blurred vision, itis, etc
- flu like symptoms too 24-75 hrs post infusion 
- afib + atypical femur fractures
	- **drugs kill osteoCLAST, so normal remodeling is slowed, and there's spiral atypical fractures. more bone mineral density just not as sound**
- hypocalcemia 

non amino bisphosphonates 
1. etidronate
2. clodronate 
- basically metabilized to compounds replacing the terminal moiety of ATP in osteoCLASTs, f you compete with ATP, this will cause osteoclast death 
amino-bisphosphonates
1. alendronate
2. ibandronate
3. risedronate
4. zoledronate
inhibits the **farnesyl diphosphate transferase FPPS**, blocking protein prenylation onto cysteine in proteins , **causing protein to NOT be trafficked to the membrane, so osteoclast acitivity is low**
inibits osteoclasts and resorption of bone 

denosumab
- human monoclonal antibody binding to RANKL, sequestiering it away from the osteoclasts, blocking this 
- used with ca and vitamin d to reduce bone loss w prostate + breast cancer therapies/metastasis 
- indicated for postmenopausal women wit osteoporosis at high fracture risk 
- given 2x a year IV
- SE: osteonecrosi of jaw, inc cancer/severe infections, 
- inc infections + eczema 
- CI: hypocalcemia + might see rapid bone loss when terminated 

strontium ranlate - more historical
- inc osteoblastogenesis both in and in vivo... 
- strontium are exhanged for ca in bone minerals and remains in the bone for eyars
inc osteoblast and dec osteoclast 
- used for osteoporosis
- SE: n/diarrhea, but there's CV risks like blood clot 

estrogens
- estradiol too - agonist for eR//// ligand activated transcription factor
- **this will reduce the bone resorbing action of PTH**
- this prevents postmenopausla osteoporosis more
- used with progestin for hormone replacement, dec bone loss in postmenopausla women 
- SE: clots + CV 
- CI - breast/endometrial canc er

SERMS
- raloxifene = ER in bone, antagonist in breast + endometrium 
- against breast cnacer + osteoporosis
SE: menopause 
less risk of endometrial cancr 

anti-sclerostin antibody = romosozumab
- sclerostin = secreeed glycoprotein which **inhibits oseoblast fomation by inhibiting the Wnt signling pathway**
	- this is specifically against osteoblasts, not clast 
	- inc wnt signalling in osteoblast 
- this drug sequesters sclerostin = making the blocked inhibitory effct of sclerostin on blast prolif 
- SE: black box. = CI, stroke, CV death 

bone mneral desnity = change relative to a baseline
