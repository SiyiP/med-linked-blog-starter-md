- difficulty in ensuring adherence too 

age related **really knw this!!**

- kidney function go lower when theyere have diabetes or htn 
also **body water- **

	- older pt confused - tell to drink more water 
- dec in lean body mass , inc in body fat 
- dec in serum albumin, so more **inc in free drug in circulation**
- kidney weight drop by like 20% 
	- dec in drug excretion
