no drug tables for the lectures but these ar problems that older ppl and differences they have when taking drugs
- dec liver/kidney funct, inc toxicity + polypharmacy 

difficulties
- decline inmany phys ffunctions
- physiology aging on drug therapy 
- inc in comorbidity 
- drugs are usually tested on younger and ideal patients! 
- heterogeneity of aging population - hard to tell ; some age better others will age worse. 
- polypharmacy 
what you notice - is inc in pain medications, hard time sleeping bc of joint stuff ... etc. 
- they're also gonna be on a lot of supplements 

check for adverse drug rxns 3x more likely in pts older
- complexity of drug-drug interactions like sait johns worts cytp50
- cost of meds are hard - put them on the generic bc they're on fixed income 
- difficulty in ensuring adherence too 

age related **really knw this!!**
- note with inc age, the percent function of glomerular filtration, cardiac index and max breathing capacity will go lower. 
- kidney function go lower when theyere have diabetes or htn 
also **body water-**
- young adults 61% 
- older adults are 53% body water!!! bc as we get older, our skin thins, so we dry out more
	- older pt confused - tell to drink more water 
- dec in lean body mass , inc in body fat 
- dec in serum albumin, so more **inc in free drug in circulation**
- kidney weight drop by like 20% 
	- dec in drug excretion 
- and hepatic blood flow drops by like 50%
	- meaning drug metabolism is slower 

effects on absorption 
- rate at absorption might be delayed
- lower peak concentration
- reaching peak concentration may be delayed
- overalll amoutn absorbed is relatively unchanged just delayed 
volume distribution = aging effects on this 
- dec body water = dec vd for hydrophilic drugs like ethanol/lithium 
- dec lean body mass = dec vd for drugs that bind to msucle digoxin 
- incr fat = inc vd for hydrophobic/lipophilic drugs like diazepam/trazodone
- decr plasma albumin = inc in unbound active drug
- inc plasma alpha1 acid glycoprotein = decr in unbound active drug 

hepatic metabolism decr in elderly 
- inc bioavailability ? in morphine, metoprolol, propranolol etc 
- not gonna metabolize it as quickly 
phase 1 = **oxidation, hydroxylation, dealkylation, reduction** -> contversion to metabolites 
phase 2 = glucuronidation, conjugation, or acetylation -> conversion to inactive metabolites
- ==**phase 2 hepatic metabolism = usually preferred in geriatrics bc inactive metabolites = less accumualtion**==
- making it more water soluble so it can be eliminated basically in phase 2 

drug metabolism modularotr
- comorbidity 
- smooking - inc cyp1A2 transcription, inc metabolism 
- diet
- drug interaction 
- frailty = more unsteady on feet might fall depending on side effects
changes in kidney 
- all decrease... decreased drug clearance too. 
- this is impacted lower excretion 

GFR = eliminated by detemining creatinine clearane, but in older ppl we can't use thiis bc
- creatinine is made by muscle, and older ppl have less of that producing it 
- lower flomerular filtration = inc in serum levels.... 
- serum lvels are like those in younger pts but gfr reduced
- toxicity 

measuring kidney function by determining clarance of creatinine 
- requires 24 hr urine collection directly 
- affected by dehydration ofc. 
- estimate it via the MDRD study equation - be aware that this exists based on sr ceatinine , age, and gender if female 
- another CKD-EPI creatinine equation = similar format ,,, factoring in more individual factors

inc followups to make sure benefits come wihtout toxicity 


ADEs - adverse drug events - they need to know
95% of these are predictable and 50% are preventable 
- we need to know and catch them in prescriptiion and monitoring stages, not the complianc level 
RFs
- low body weight
- see diff specialists = polypharm/comorbidity 
- age 80+ 
- lower liver and kidney function 

==Beer's crriteria = set of standards for determining risks and recommendations for prescribing drugs to the elderly== 
recs based on: 
- age/dz/condition drug interactions
- drug-drug interactions = 

2019 report
- drug class
- rationale - description of AEs 
- recs - usually to avoid/limit use 
- quality of evidence
- strength of rec 
american geriatrics society app 

1. first gen antihistamines -> anticholinergic, reducd clearance with age, tolerance, constipation, dry mouth, confusion bc ach inhibiting in brain
2. peripheral alpha-1 blockers for htn like prazosin and terazosin = > risk of orthostatic hypotension 
3. central alpha blockers like clonidine/methyldopa = > cns effects, brady, orthostatic
4. digoxin = > avoid use for afib, bc toxicity and mortality 
5. amiodarone - avoid bc toxicity ataxia + neuropathy 
6. antidepressants = they are highly anticholinergic, sedating, orthostatic 
7. antipsychotics - **inc stroke risk, greater cognitive decline**, behavioral issues in dementia, only use for bipolar and schizophrenia 
8. barbiturates = physical dep, tol to sleep benefits, od 
9. benzodiazepines = inc chloride conductiance, they will make sure the Cl- is conducted more, putting more - charge inside nerve cells, harder to **depolarize signals = for anxiety**.... ppl get inc sensitivity, dec metabolism, cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, auto accidents, 
10. estrogens = inc cancer risk 
11. proton pump inhibitors = inc risk of c diff, bone loss, fractures.. avoid long term use 
12. meperidine/demerol = not effective at normal dosage, inc neurotoxciity compared to other opioids 
13. nsaids = incr GI bleeding, upper GI ulcers, perforations avoid chronic use. 
14. skeletal muscle relaxers = poorly tol, anticholinergic, sedation, inc fractures 
15. beta blockers/agonits = les responsive due to dec in sympathetic signalling 


corticosteroids x nsaids = more risk of gi diseas  

somethign opiods and sometign else that depresses resp = inc risk of falls


principles of prescribint
- take pt hx of all prescriptions and drugs
- dx then prescribe
- therapeutic endpoints + followup - what's the goal? 
- low dose + titrate slowly 
- avoid 2 agents at the same time starting 
- reach therapeutic dose b4 switching and or adding agents 

Drug drug interactions
- cardiovasc
- psychotropic drug
- anticholinergic drugs
most common interactions cause:
- confusion, cog impair, hypotension, acute renal failure, incontinence 

changes in vol of distrib = obesity + lipophilic drugs, ascites alters the vd of hydrophilic drugs, or fraility too in drugs that bind muscle 

non-adherence is up to 50% - forgetfulness, cost, etc any thing can cause this
