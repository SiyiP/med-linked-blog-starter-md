no drug tables for the lectures but these ar problems that older ppl and differences they have when taking drugs
- dec liver/kidney funct, inc toxicity + polypharmacy 

difficulties
- decline inmany phys ffunctions
- physiology aging on drug therapy 
- inc in comorbidity 
- drugs are usually tested on younger and ideal patients! 
- heterogeneity of aging population - hard to tell ; some age better others will age worse. 
- polypharmacy 
what you notice - is inc in pain medications, hard time sleeping bc of joint stuff ... etc. 
- they're also gonna be on a lot of supplements 

check for adverse drug rxns 3x more likely in pts older
- complexity of drug-drug interactions like sait johns worts cytp50
- cost of meds are hard - put them on the generic bc they're on fixed income 
- difficulty in ensuring adherence too 

age related **really knw this!!**
- note with inc age, the percent function of glomerular filtration, cardiac index and max breathing capacity will go lower. 
- kidney function go lower when theyere have diabetes or htn 
also **body water-**
- young adults 61% 
- older adults are 53% body water!!! bc as we get older, our skin thins, so we dry out more
	- older pt confused - tell to drink more water 
- dec in lean body mass , inc in body fat 
- dec in serum albumin, so more **inc in free drug in circulation**
- kidney weight drop by like 20% 
	- dec in drug excretion 
- and hepatic blood flow drops by like 50%
	- meaning drug metabolism is slower 

effects on absorption 
- rate at absorption might be delayed
- lower peak concentration
- reaching peak concentration may be delayed
- overalll amoutn absorbed is relatively unchanged just delayed 
volume distribution = aging effects on this 
- dec body water = dec vd for hydrophilic drugs like ethanol/lithium 
- dec lean body mass = dec vd for drugs that bind to msucle digoxin 
- incr fat = inc vd for hydrophobic/lipophilic drugs like diazepam/trazodone
- decr plasma albumin = inc in unbound active drug
- inc plasma alpha1 acid glycoprotein = decr in unbound active drug 

hepatic metabolism decr in elderly 
- inc bioavailability ? in morphine, metoprolol, propranolol etc 
- not gonna metabolize it as quickly 
phase 1 = **oxidation, hydroxylation, dealkylation, reduction** -> contversion to metabolites 
phase 2 = glucuronidation, conjugation, or acetylation -> conversion to inactive metabolites
- **phase 2 hepatic metabolism = usually preferred in geriatrics bc inactive metabolites = less accumualtion**
