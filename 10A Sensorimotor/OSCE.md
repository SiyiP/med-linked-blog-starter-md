- **Triceps Reflex** – _shoulder and arms._ the arm at the elbow with the palm facing the body, and pull the arm partially across the chest. Strike the triceps tendon directly behind and just above the elbow.  Alternatively, support the upper arm with the arm bent slightly at the elbow and hanging limp.   *Both are shown in Bates video and FPC lecture video.
	- i've been taught the 2nd version with the arm supportd and hanging limp
