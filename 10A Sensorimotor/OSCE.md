- **Triceps Reflex** – _shoulder and arms._ the arm at the elbow with the palm facing the body, and pull the arm partially across the chest. Strike the triceps tendon directly behind and just above the elbow.  Alternatively, support the upper arm with the arm bent slightly at the elbow and hanging limp.   *Both are shown in Bates video and FPC lecture video.
	- i've been taught the 2nd version with the arm supportd and hanging limp 

in general to get them back from seating to supine, ask if i could help them get down while sliding the footrest both in and out. 

note  - we need to go back and forth to check up on and feel the legs. 
- for the hip extension you don't have to keep your hl hand under her back 
- you have to guide her leg and extend it out a bit, having your hand on her thigh + leg 
- guide her with the internal and external rotation too 
- while you ask her to bring leg to side and cross it, l hand on ASIS 
- to apply resistance, you need to push against, ask them to push against, and for add/abduction, push on the sides .... 
- for external + internal rotation get their knee bend , positioned like that, and then ask to push their knee against your hand. 

start looking at feet + ankles, 
- must tell them if there is or isn't swelling , hold finger down on medial to tibia and then the joint ankle line. and then brush against where a pit woudl be made. 
for ROM, ankle for inversion/eversion, ask them to bring soles in / out
