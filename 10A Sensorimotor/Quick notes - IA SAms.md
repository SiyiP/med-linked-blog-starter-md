| Trabecular bone has a larger surface area, is more metabolically active, and responds more rapidly to changes in calcium and hormonal levels, making it more susceptible to osteoporosis.                                                                                                                                                        |     |

| \|Osteoclastic tunneling refers to a coordinated process where osteoclasts form a resorption canal (cutting cone) that advances through cortical bone, followed by osteoblasts that refill the tunnel. Surface resorption, on the other hand, involves osteoclasts creating pits or trenches on the bone surface, often seen in trabecular bone. |     |
| A T-score ≤ -2.5 confirms osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are first-line therapy, and lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise, smoking cessation, calcium/vitamin D intake) are essential.                                                                                                                                                               |     |

| Men aged 70 and older, or younger men with risk factors (e.g., corticosteroid use), should be screened for osteoporosis. This patient meets criteria based on age and medication history.                                                                                                                                                        |     |

| The tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle passes through the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus, deep to the transverse humeral ligament.  This tendon can become inflamed and tender with excessive wear and/or repeated movement in sports like baseball or tennis.  This condition is called biceps tendinitis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|If biceps tendinitis is left untreated, it can lead to the ==**rupture of the long head of the biceps**.  In this case, the tendon is typically torn from its proximal attachment (origin) on the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula.  Rupture is typically associated with a loud snap or popping sound and can lead to distal displacement of the biceps brachii muscle belly, which is called a _**Popeye deformity**_.==  This deformity appears as a bulge in the distal aspect of the arm.\|   \|. = this is when it's a POP!!!! |     |
| The **coracobrachialis** muscle originates from the coracoid process of the scapula and inserts on the anterior aspect of the medial shaft of the humerus.  This muscle is responsible for flexion and **AD**duction of the arm at the shoulder joint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |

Loss of sensation leads to unnoticed injuries and altered pressure distribution.  In the absence of protective sensation, these injuries go unnoticed and accumulate over time.  Microtrauma triggers inflammatory responses and tissue breakdown, especially in areas with poor perfusion.  Neurovascular dysfunction predisposes tissue to injury and impairs healing.  Microtrauma acts as a trigger, while neurovascular changes prevent recovery, leading to ulcer formation.

| Tinel's sign is a clinical test used to detect irritation or compression of a nerve, most commonly the median nerve in cases of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).  The examiner taps or percusses lightly over the median nerve at the wrist (just above the carpal tunnel). This is typically done using the fingers or a reflex hammer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |

| only the PTH receptor agonist teriparatide, can actively promote bone formation. The PTH receptor is expressed on osteoblasts, not on osteoclasts. PTH promotes osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and survival, and intermittent PTH administration promotes bone formation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     |
