| Trabecular bone has a larger surface area, is more metabolically active, and responds more rapidly to changes in calcium and hormonal levels, making it more susceptible to osteoporosis.                                                                                                                                                          |     |

| \|Osteoclastic tunneling refers to a coordinated process where osteoclasts form a resorption canal (cutting cone) that advances through cortical bone, followed by osteoblasts that refill the tunnel. Surface resorption, on the other hand, involves osteoclasts creating pits or trenches on the bone surface, often seen in trabecular bone.\| |     |
| A T-score ≤ -2.5 confirms osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are first-line therapy, and lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise, smoking cessation, calcium/vitamin D intake) are essential.                                                                                                                                                                 |     |

| The tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle passes through the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus, deep to the transverse humeral ligament.  This tendon can become inflamed and tender with excessive wear and/or repeated movement in sports like baseball or tennis.  This condition is called biceps tendinitis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
| \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|If biceps tendinitis is left untreated, it can lead to the **rupture of the long head of the biceps**.  In this case, the tendon is typically torn from its proximal attachment (origin) on the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula.  Rupture is typically associated with a loud snap or popping sound and can lead to distal displacement of the biceps brachii muscle belly, which is called a _**Popeye deformity**_.  This deformity appears as a bulge in the distal aspect of the arm.\|   \|. = this is when it's a POP!!!! |     |
| The **coracobrachialis** muscle originates from the coracoid process of the scapula and inserts on the anterior aspect of the medial shaft of the humerus.  This muscle is responsible for flexion and **AD**duction of the arm at the shoulder joint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     |
