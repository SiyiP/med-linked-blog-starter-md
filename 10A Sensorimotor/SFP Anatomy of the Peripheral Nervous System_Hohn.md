largely a review from block 1 - 
structural PNS: cranial n(12 pairs) + 31 pairs of spinal nerves
2 primary functional components 
- sensory components = afferent
- ==motor efferent components==
	- ==somatic,==
	- ==visceral / autonomic==
		- ==sympathetic== 
		- ==parasympathetic== 
		- ==enteric== 

keep in mind DNS has the sensory and motor components, which will connect to the effectors. 
==PNS has ganglia (bodies) and nerves (axons)== 
==CNS includes spinal cords, which connect to the PNS== 

1. ==sensory = dorsal root ganglia - these have sensory cell BODIES relaying from periphery to CNS via the *dorsal root==* 
2. ==autonomic ganglia = these are cell bodies that relay motor responses to glands, SM, and cardiac muscle== 
	- ==parasympathetic is close to the target tissue==

peripheral nerve = cranial or spinal nerves - made up of axon bundles + CT coverings
==3 layers of CT==
1. ==endoneurium = CT surrounding each individual axon== 
2. ==perineurium = enclosing a BUNDLE of axons or a **fascicle**==
3. ==epineurium = CT surrounding/enclosing fascicle of fascicles forming the outermost.== 

PNS = cranial nerves = not touched on til block 11, but there's like 12 pairs
- ==spinal accessory nerve is cranial nerve 11, somatically innervating the trapezius.== 
- they are numbered in ways they attach to brain, and all exit from cranial cavity 
- they're mixed nerves, contain sensory and or motor fibers. 

spinal cord = extends from base of skull to L1/2 
- enlargements;
	- ==cervical enlargement C5-T2(can vary) = has ventral primary rami of spinal nerves that corresponds to innervating upper extremity : **brachial plexus**==
	- ==lumbosacral enlargement - innervates lower extremity: lumbar+sacral plexus== 
- 31 pairs of these attached to the spinal cord 
	- 8 cervical
	- 12 T
	- 5 L
	- 5S
	- 1 coccygeal

identify these in deep back prosection: 
distal end of spinal cord = we see conus medullaris = the tapering cone-shaped end at the level of L1-L2
- past that end we got cauda equina, a collection of nerve roots of L/S spinal nerves beyond the medullaris. 
- ==filum terminale = extends from conus medullaris, pia mater, which will anchor the *spinal cord to the coccyx inferiorly==* 

gray v white matter
- ==gray matter: rich in cell bodies, butterfly shaped, dark, H-shaped too== 
	- has horns
	- ==ventral horn = motor neurons , stops in the white matter== 
	- ==dorsal horn = bleeds off or runs off of the dorsal end! contains sensory neurons== 
	- ==lateral horn - only in certain parts of the spinal cord, has **visceral motor neurons pertaining to autonomics**==
		- ==T1-L2 = sympathetic==
		- ==S2-4 = parasympathetic== 
		- these are in between dorsal and ventral, poking through 
- white - rich in axon, surrounding the gray. they make ascending and descending tracks that build that connection with the brain 

spinal nerves
- exits the vertebrae column below the intervertebral foramen, ==typically below the vertebra except in cervical nerves (above the corresponding one in C1, and then C8 will exit between C7/T1 bc there's not 8 Cervical vertebrae)==
- ==for the rest, the spinal nerves travel obliquely down== 
- basically ==dorsal and ventral rootlets will attach to the spinal cord to converge and make the **dorsal/ventral ROOT**==
	- ==dorsal + ventral nerve roots = spinal nerve==
	- ==note: spinal nerve is short, will divide into:==
		- ==dorsal ramus - supplies deep muscles of back and overlying skin , travels posterior== 
		- ==ventral primary ramus - supplies muscles joints, skin of limbs + skin remainder of trunk, traveling anterior==  
	- spinal segments = are seen as the dotted line between these, formed by bilateral presence of dorsal and ventral rootlets, like elevators on each floor. 

==thoracic spinal nerve === 
- after dividing into the ==ventral ramus will divide into **white ramus communicans, which merge into the sympathetic chain, helping preganglionic fibers go into the sympathetic chain**==
- ==if the white ramus isn't present we can guess we're outside of T1-L2; no sympathetic chain== 

efferent vs afferent neurons
- spinal nerves have both usually as mixed axons
- sensory afferent = typically sensory from body wall (touch, pain, temp position) back to the CNS.  
- ==somatic efferents/motor = just skeletal muscles, delivers impulses from CNS distally to target muscles==
- dorsal roots = of spinal nerves = **only afferent/sensory neurons** 
	- ==somatic sensory neuron ending in the skin on your ***front*** takes sensation thru *ventral ramus of spinal nerve back thru the spinal nerve, then to the dorsal root* (this is the splitting point) to go back to the CNS== 
	- if they convey on the dorsal aspect, the ==sensory nerve ending in the skin on the back will travel thru the dorsal ramus thru the dorsal root and then into the CNS== 
		- ==visceral sensory = autonomics, originate from lateral horn  , smooth muscle== 
- ventral roots = convey efferent/motor neurons from cell bodies from the ventral horn 
	- ==somatic motor efference, conveys thru the ventral root, then thru ventral ramus -> **all muscles except intrinsic back muscles**==
	- ==efferent neurons from ventral horn thru the dorsal ramus: **intrinsic back muscles**== 
	- visceral motor: autonomics, originate from lateral horn  , smooth muscle 

==dorsal primary rami==: will pass **postriorly** as branches of mixed spinal nerves 
- ==supplies motor innervation to intrinsic back muscles + associated narrow strip of skin on back and scalp==
- there's cutaneous branches... understand that there's some posterior branches that pass thru all these muscles 
- ==one named nerve = greater occipital n = dorsal ramus of C2, will be supplying to back of scalp==
==ventral primary rami- mixed, anterior branches of spinal nerves,== 
- ==basically supplies to everything that's not intrinsic back muscles== 
- except for some parts of head 
- will make networks of spinal nerves: plexuses
- all major somatic plexuses formed: 
	- cervical C1-4 block 11 
	- lumbar plexus: L1-4 
	- sacral plexus L4-S4
	- brachial C5-T1
all the thoracic spinal nerves that AREN't part of plexus: these all continue as intercostal nerves ! 
some major visceral components are associated with ventral primary rami

==brachial plexus !!!==
==somatic nerve plexus made by **ventral primary rami C5-T1**==
all upper limb nerves will come from here. 
musculocutaneous nerve - innervate anterior part of arm. formed by these all, for example ; C4,6,7 - figure out which of the primary rami contribute to which nerves!!!
- al this is important when looking at dermatomes/myotomes
- dermatomes - segment of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve... can overlap and tested by touching the center 
- ==myotome = portion of skeletal muscle innervated by single spinal nerve... individual muscles are typically innervated by more than one level... tested by movement of successive joints to localize it==
