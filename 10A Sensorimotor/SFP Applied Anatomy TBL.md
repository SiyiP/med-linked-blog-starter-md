subscapularis - most likely injury with rotator cuff injury 
lumbricals - 
- only 2 medial umbrical musles are paralyzed from inuries w severe compression to the ulnar nerve....
- thenar eminence + **2 lateral lumbrical muscles are not affected, innervatd by the median nerve** 
- in situation, both the flexor + extensor extrinsic musles are unopposed, so this causes a clawed hand. 

none of the flexors extrinsicly can also exten
- lumbricals + interosseus muscles can both extend + flex ; this synergy happens ultimately 
- cause flexion in MCP bc they insert into the extensor expansion, which is part of the tendon from **below**, and pull on this extensor tendon when flexing... that's how they cause both. 

recall: rotator cuff - SITS muscles inserting on tuberosity  
- superspinatous = most likely one to get injured in adults bc it rubs on the acromion process 
- infrapsinatous 
- teres minor 
- subscapularis 

brachial plexus injury 
- grabbing a branch 
- why is it lateral 2 lumbricals that aren't injured
	- bc it's innervated not by the ulnar nerve, but the median n. 
- in traction injuries - these are injuries at the ROOT
	- can have upper brachial plexus
	- lower brachial plexus
		- in the case of lower = you afect the roots. 
		- C8, T1 impacted with brachial plexus - major components of ulnar nerve
		- all other intrinsi muscles of hands innervated by the ulner nerve except the adductor pollicis of the thenar eminence 
hyperabduction T1, C8 = - **Cause:** Can occur when the arm is forced upward and away from the body, like when grasping something to break a fall or in a birth injury where the arm is pulled excessively. lower BP injury 

5 and 6 lesion  - - **Cause:** Often result from the shoulder being forced down while the head is tilted away, like in a fall or during childbirth ([shoulder dystocia](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=2fee5486871b890d&q=shoulder+dystocia&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj63-T5hbCPAxVfkmoFHV1DHtwQxccNegUIwAEQAQ)).upper BP injury
