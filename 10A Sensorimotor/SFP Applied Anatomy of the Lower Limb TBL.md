- popliteal a -> anterior tibial a earlier branch -> branch into posterior tibial a + fibular a (traveled in the posterior compartment) and fibular a gives br to lateral compartment , giving the superficial fibular a 

lower extremity case review
4 clinical cases 
case 1 
20 yo athelte - sudden, sharp r lat hip pain during match
- powerful kicking motion with **right hip abducted and medially rotating**
- overexertion injury , potentially 

exactly where's his hip at? 
in what part of the movement did you feel the pain?
how long? 
- 3 days ago
- sharp pain + **pop felt as soon as he kicked the ball and be4 he hit the ground**
- getting worse, esp when he rest on his R side. 
- wobbly gait etc . 
MCL? 
- motion: abduction of right hip as he mooved from extension to flexion to meet the ball. as he quickly flexed at hip, he medially rotated thigh to direct ball back to center. 
- abduction -> extension then flexion quickly 
- gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, semiendinosus, semimembranosus  = all will extend the thigh at hip 
	- **hip extension = bringing leg back... and hip flexion = raising hip forward**
- hip abductors
	- gluteus medius + minimus, tensor fascia lata  
	- **sartorious can also abduct but only whn thigh is laterall rotated and flexed** = tailor muscle! **think about what ur thighs + legs are doing as you're assuming that position!** it's abducting but only when flexing. so in this person they can't do this 

with thigh extended and abducted we think about 
- gluteus max, medius and 
which strongly flex thigh at hip 
- rectus femoris, sartorius - in the case of this we have to laterally rotate this. so since he's rotating medially we are unlikely to have this involved for him specifically ==**, pectineus , iliopsoas**== - center of femoral triangle floor 

medially rotates thigh during abduction + forceful flexion??
- gluteus medius and minimis - anterior fibers initiate medial rotation 
	- ==**recall - they anteriorly insert onto the greater trochanters anteriorly - the anterior fibers of both of these cause medial rotation esp during forceful stress**==

where to palpate the greater trocanter??
- palpate them iliac crest laterally to the straight down, it takes u to it 
- this pt has marked tenderness at that location over the great trochanter. 
- initial thoughts = 
	- issue with the gluteal muscles
	- iliotibial band too tight = common issue in that region 
	- compression of a nerve 
	- greater trochanteric bursitis - one of the most common maladies 
	- inferior dislocation of the head/femur

muscles isnerting onto greater trochanter
- gluteus minimis + medius, 
- superior + inf gemellus 
- obturator internus 
	- obturator externus does too but thru the backside 
- piriformis = insertion 

trochanteric bursae - 
- iliotibial band + skin 
- bt iliotibial band and greater trochanter
- bt inserting fibers of gluetus maximus + greater trochanter
- bt tendons of gluetus minimus + gluteus medius 
- trochanteric bursitis - has a hgue tendancy to spread, this is something that they have and prevents them from resting on side, comes on chronically 



tredelenburg sign - keeping pelvis level with the gluteus minimus.... but if it doesn't work, you woddle . 
- pelvic drop on one side 

tensor fascia lata = superior gluteal innervation as well 
- something wrong with the superior gluteal as well? 

gluteus medius tendon tear seen on the MRI - at the insertion 
- interruption of that tendon 
- hematoma = seen in white fluid , with partial tear of muscle 
---
case 2 + 3 
ice skating
- collided
- granddaughter twisted ankle and skates were too big
- grandpa = in a lot of pain 

10 yo girl
- right ankle pain 
- in socks, said right ankle is rlly hurting + getting worse since she removed the skates. 
- can't bear weight on her right foot 
how did you twist ur ankle? 
did you hear a pop
- she sprained the same ankle, and got better apparently 
- she felt a pop. 
- foot was turned IN under her. 
- inversion injury 

marked tenderness to touch + swelling inf and anterior to lateral malleolus of the right foot 
eccymoses - bruise/hematoma greater than 2 cm 
- evulsion fracture on the lateral malleolus + distal fibula 
- ligament rupture 
hyperinversion of the foot
- ==subtalar joint - helps us walk on uneven surfaces, very important for inversion and eversion. sliding movement== 
	- talus + calcaneus 
ankle joint = tibia + talus (unrelated)

- strained in hyper inversion -= anything with talofibular in it, like anterior talofibular, calcaneofibular, and posterior talofibular ligament = all ones that are strained. 
order an xray - 
they use ultrasound a lot... if you're really good at it it could be used to see avulsion fracture. 
- best line of vision - ATFL - at the anterior fibulocollateral ligament ? - 
- good to view any fracture of the lateral malleolus 
- part of bone pulled away with the ligament that was stretched!!

**fibularis tertius = inserts ALONG THE SHAFT, on the top of the bone of the 5th metatarsal, but not the base**
fibularis brevis = **INSERTS into the base of the 5th metatarsal; strethcing is distributed at the base.**
- ==2 ways of getting the avulsion fracture==
- ==either ligament gets pulled away== 
- ==or tendon can pull the bone away== 
note that cortical bone fractures are common in children bc their bones are not as well formed 

case 3
- was worried about broke leg
- felt a pop and worries
- pain = both knees hurt but can't stand on right leg + pain in that knee is severe. 
- getting worse pain, also t2dm, arthritis in both knees, 
- got a "bad bladder infection"
- dr gave him cipro antibiotic in mexico = fluoroquinolone 
L patella higher than the right
palpable gap is found superior to patella of right knee. 

early differential
- patellar fracture
- quadriceps tendon tear 
- fluoroquinolone would interrupt proper collagen / CT formation maybe
- patellar lig
he can't extend r leg in straight leg lift... 
- issue with the 
- teste for lateral collateral or medial collateral ligament tears with the vargus and varsus test
- negative result = neither of those ligametns 
- not doing draer test bc of the pain he's in 
at least 20 degrees of valgus instability = 
- due to bad medial collateral ligament
- leg keeps tilting out 
positive varus instability 
- due to bad lateral collateral ligament 
- like the leg keeps tilting in 

in the anterior attaching to tibial plateu 
- what's most anterior structure attaching to that/
- anterior horn of medial meniscus

- lack of extnsion at r knee, gap superior to patella, recent cipro, no indication of lateral + medial collateral ligament dmg
differentials: 
- - rupture of quad tendon 
- fratured patellar 
- torn patellar ligament 

patellar tendon - connect muscle to bone at insertions
ligaments = connect bones to other bones, around joint. 
patellar ligament = patella to tibia connection 
patellar tendon = misnomer, does NOT EXIST

patellar baja = lower patella due to quadriceps tendon tear, bc the patellar ligment is unopposed now. 

old woman falls, can't stand back up 
- sharp and deep pain, prox left thigh 
- pain in both thighs , but rlly bad on l 
- dull ache in past 8 mon 
- dx w osteoporosis, taking bisphosphonates for 8 yrs., and they switched her to monoclonal antibx with gastric reluxz = pain in thigh , indicating potential fracture
- l leg is laterally rotated + abducted, and looks shortr than her right = think **fracture or dislocation of L femur**
- worry abt blood loss if a branch is dmg'd ... esp if it's a femoral a 
	- worry about the inf dislocation of head, intracapsular region fracture, and anything that serves the head and neck of femur. 
	- obturator internus atery = serves the region if you're a child, not an adult. 
	- atypical sub trochanteric fracture - common for bisphosphonate drug 
	- thickening of periosteum + cortical bone due to bisphosphonates. -> easily made atypical fractures. 
	- reasons for lat rotations - strong lat rotators aer rotating upper piece of bones. 
	- looks shorter bc the muscles from the pelvis, are pulling the fragmented distal bones upward, giving that ilusion of a smaller leg. or shorter one. 
	- bisphosphonates - recall they're taken into bone and they stay there. for years afterwards. causes osteoclasts which take that up by die via appotosis, stopping absorption. 
		- start laying down bone but never lamellar bone, so it's brittle. 
		- monoclonal antibody also attacks osteoclasts by making rankl unavaiabile.... so these **osteoclasts never grow up to be mature, so you don't have these.**
