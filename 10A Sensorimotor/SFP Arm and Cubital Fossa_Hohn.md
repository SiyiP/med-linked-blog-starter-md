understand - arm = brachium 
region of upper extremity between shoulder + elbow, differentiate from forearm 
one bone making it = humerus 
- articulate distally with radiums laterally and ulna medially 
- superior = glenohumeral joint 

anterior view.  - 
- importance of the greater + lessr tubrcle = wwe see intertubercular sulcus! the depression which allows for passage of the longhead(?) brachial muscle 
- medial epicondyle vs lateral epicondyle = distalmost aspect, just superior are supracondylar ridges (also medial+lateral) all of these are for muscle attachment. 
- lateral epicondyle has capitulum, a lateral aspect, smooth, which articulates with head of radius
- more medial = trochlea articulating with ulva at trochlear notch 
- radial fosssa = accomodates head of radius at forearm flexion. 
- 2nd fossa = coronoid fossa superior to trochlea, receives that 

posterior view - **look at the scapula first to immediaeely in form yu**
- radial groove - at midshaft, proximal to it. 
	- allows neurovascular structures to traverse this space
	- olecranon fossa - receives the olecranon - the body part of ulna during extnsion of forearm at elbow 
	- elbow has specific featurs noted - in extension specifically 
		- all listed tings need to be familiarized. 
		- radial tuberosity = also important for attaching biceps brachia muscle
		- coronoid process go in the coronoid fossa during flexion of elbow 
		- olecranon = in the posterior seen 

fascial compartments of arm 
- brachial fascia enclses whole arm - we might see it being called "deep fascia"
- from there, this compartment will be devided by medial+latral intrmuscular septa (extends from deep fascia into humerus, division into anterior + posterior!!!)
- each compartment has: muscle set, nerves and arteries! 

anterior compartment
- for flexing at sohulder joint,
- to adduct = moving arm down towards body wall, at shoulder joint 
- 3 muscles
	- biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, brachiaslis 
	- branchi - long head origin, from supraglenid tubercl of scapula. then short head attach to the coracoid process. shares a commn tendon with it 
		- radial tuberosity insertion, the medial bony emmenance on radius 
		- and antebrachial fascia insertion (antebrachial = forearm) by the bicipital aponeurosis (we will maintain and reflect this in lab) - crosses 2 joints (shoulder and elbow. 
		- supinates the elbow , meaning it's most effective when forearm is flexed, like you turn a screwdriver.)
	- coracobrachialis - from the coracoid process as the common tendon with short head of biceps brachii ... inserts into anterior aspect of medial shaft of the humerus 
		- action to flex at the shoulder + adducts
		- pierced by the **musculocutaneous nerve!! pierced by the nerve that innervates it**
			- pass infriorly between biceps + brachialis muscles!!! as it goes infriorly 
			- eventually will **emerge just lateral to biceps tendon as lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve.**  - change the name. aka the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. 
				- sensory innervation to lateral portion of forearm 
	- brachialis - will originate from antrior aspect of distal half of humerous, will CROSS elbow + insert into coronoid process of ulna and ulnar tuberosity, think about the muscle fibers shortened, and movement would be flexing at elbow. 
- bloodsupply from brachial a.
	- begins at inferior border of teres major muscle as continuation of axillary a... recall from subclavian artery! this changes name to axillary a as the first rib... then changes name into brachial artery at teres major 
	- lies superficial on medial aspect of arm. 
	- largest branch = profunda brachii a (in radial grove, biggest)
	- superior + inferior ulnar collateral branches - will give anastamoses , descends 
	- at cubital fossa, as it continues inferiorly, right anterior, it will bifurcate into radial + ulnar artery (more medial)
- nerve = musculocutaneous nerve

posterior compartment - 
- triceps brachii - 3 heads, exten forearm at elbow joint
	- long had from the infraglenoid tubercl of scapula 
	- lateral head from proximal to radial groove
	- medial head distal to radial groove; this is tucked in between long and lateral, might have to make a small incision 
	- insertion = on posterior surface of olecranon 
	- extend forearm at elbow + weakly extend/adduct arm at shoulder... due to long head attachment to scapula 
- radial nerve - enter into posterior compartment of arm 
	- then spirals around radial groove of humerus, between lateral+medial heads, accompanied by profunda brachii a 
	- seen easily without much dissection but pick thru to isolate nerve from a. 
	- location important clinically bc if you fracture the midshaft of your humerus, you can damage the radial nerve!!! 
		- fall in elderly or car collision ): 
		- injury to it proximal to elbow: wrist drop seen due to hard to extend hand at wrist, some difficulty extending fingers against resistance + loss of sensation in posterior forearm + dorsal hand 
			- basically this provides innervation to extenders of your forearm 
	- pierces the lateral intermuscular septum just superior of elbow joint 
	- travels inferiorly , between brachialis + brachioradialis mm (will find it without fail)
	- when it gets to the cubital fossa area (anterior to elbow joint, will divide)
		- into superficial and deep branches = locate at lab! 
- profunda brachii a = a branch of the brachial a
	- supplies posterior compartment, parallels the raidal nerve inside the radial groove
	- gives rise to anastomoses around elbow and **ascending branch to the shoulder joint!**
	- anastamoses:at least know where they come from, not who anastamose with whom. 
		- from collateral or recurrent branches 
		- understand = collateral descend, recurrent ascend!!! 
		- collaterals: 
			- profundal brachii artery gives rise to radial and middle collateral a
			- from brachial a, we give superior + infrior ulnar collateral, which are on medial aspect
		- recurrrents: 
			- radial a -> radial recurrent a
			- ulnar a -> anterior + posterior ulcer recurrent a 

other nerves - just be aware 
- medial brachial cutaneous nerve - goes to skin, might lose it .... maintain if you can , but it'll be a loose end
- intercostobrachial cutaneous nerve - medial too lol maintain if you can , but it'll be a loose end
- medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve  - medial of forearm etc. maintain if you can , but it'll be a loose end
- ulnar nerve = terminal branches thru the arm, no functino, headed to more distal structures in the forearm + hands 
- median nerve =  terminal branches thru the arm, no functino, headed to more distal structures in the forearm + hands 


anterior cutaneous nerves... look at the images

cubital fossa bounds
- prox = line b/t medial/lateral epicondyles
- lat = brachioradialis 
- medial - pronator teres
- roof = skin, fascia and bicipital aponeurosis **
whats inside it 
- TAN lateral to medial 
	- biceps brachii tendon 
	- brachial artery 
	- median nerve 

veins of arm - try to maintain ; medial to lateral
- basillic vein - pierces brachial fascia upon ascent to axilla, main tributary of axillary v. near or at the inferior border of teres major m. 
- cephalic v = lateral, travels inferiorly and then epties into the axillary v in the deltopectoral triangle
	- be careful!!! when taking skin off in lateral region of shoulder!!!! 
- median cubital vein = the joining of cephalic + basilic v in the cubital fossa, moer intferior 
	bicipital aponeurosis = roof of the cubital fossa, immediately deep of the median cubital vein 
	this is a site of muscle attachment, separating bahial a and median nerve from median cubital vein!!
		this bicipital aponeurosis helps u prevent artery sticking with a needle!!!!! barrier !

lymphatics 
- lateral = empties into infraclavicular nodes which then drain to apical nodes of axilla 
- medial = empty into lateral axillary nodes 
	- also hands/forearms can also drain into the cubital nodes or straight into lateral axillary nodes

biceps tendinitis
- long head of biceps travelling thru intertubercular sulcus of humerus, this tendon is a common issue 0: 
- bicep tendon is deep to the ligament called transverse humeral ligament. 
- excessive repetitive movements = microtrauma, overhands  = will make it inflammed 
but if untreated, can lead to rupture of long head of biceps
- tendon torn from attachment of the supraglenoid tubercle
- seen with a snap or pop 
- "displaced muscle, popeye demformity" = leads to distally displaced belly of biceps is loose and more near forearms
long head can also be dislocated from intertubercular sulcus 
- tendon tears thru transverse humeral ligament - 
- can test = **yergason's test** - they flex to 90 degrees , with forearm pronated, externally rotating while supenating, turning out while external rotation 
- clinician will resist that while touching shoulder to feel for pain/dislocation of the tendon from the sulcus
