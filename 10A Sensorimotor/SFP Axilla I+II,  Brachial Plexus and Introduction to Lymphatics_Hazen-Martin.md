learn: 
- which muscles attach the upper limb to pectoral girdle+axial skeleton
- which bones in the pectoral girdle? 
	- clavicle anteriorly, and then the scapula. = these bear the attachment of the upper limb
		- bone of arm: humerus ; will articulate with acromion and the radius laterally and ulna medially at the elbow joint. 
		- **brachium = arm** 
		- **antebrachium = forearm** 
	- articulations are with the axial skeleton and the arm. 
	1. clavicle - lateral 1/3 is conCAVE anteriorly, which will articulate with acromion, and then the convex medial side, which is 2/3 convex anteriorly for articulation with the sternum and first costal cartilage
		- note: the most frequently fractured bone in the body, this will be at the joint/curve of the S shape 
		- dislocation at the acromion side is very common "shoulder separation"
	2. right scapula: anterior view. dr reaves focused on the posterior [[SFP Superficial Back and Shoulder_Reaves]]
		- inferior angle = where medial/lat meet 
		- medial border extends to the superior border, which also has a notch 
		- subscapular fossa = **concave anterior surface**, will originate the subscapularis muscle
		- medial border anteriorly - for the serratus anterior
			- recall posterior medial border is the insertion for both rhomboids + levator on the medial posterior border
		- note - coracoid process is on the anterior side of this. = a site of origin for some muscles 
	3. the humerus = the proximal end is focused on, be aware that the head is huge and lined with hyaine cartilage
		1. anatomic neck is just below the head
		2. distal to anatomic neck: 2 tubercles
			1. lesser tubercle = directly antriorly 
			2. greater tubercle = directed laterally 
		3. bicipital groove(long tendon of bicep runs along this) /intertubercular groove 
			- many muscles insert upon this groove on diff sides
			- teres major on the medial lip
			- lateral lip pectoralis major 
			- in the middle: latissimus dorsi 
		4. distal to tubercles is the surgical neck, a common place for injuries
- how's the axilla formed? (this is a space) - this has 4 walls and is pyramid shaped. 
	- has a posterior, medial, lateral, and anterior wall
	- has a narrow inlet and a larger outlet as a broader base 
		- inlet transmits all these nerves as well as the continuation of SUBCLAVIANs, which **become axillary when they pass thru it**
		- inlet: superior border of scapula, clavicle, and outer border of the first rib. anything that cramps this area = thoracic outlet syndrome, anything that might constrict the inlet. 
		- base of axilla = the skin of the armpit, which closes it up 
		- anterior axillary wall = 
			- pectoralis major - outward biggest one ; broad origin from sternum, clavical, costal cartilages, all the fibers come together to insert into the **lateral tip of the bicipital groove**
				- just adjacent to the anterior part of the deltoid muscle. this adducts, medially rotate + flexes the arm. 
				- cephalic vein will travel between these muscles and then dive into the deltopectoral triangle. 
				- edges of the deltopectoral triangle: the pectoralis major, the cephalic vein underneath the deltoid, and the clavicle. 
				- ![[deltopectoral triangle.png]]
			- pectoralis minor - deep to pec major - shaped like major but smaller, from ribs 3-5 and inserts on coracoid procss
				- depresses te shoulder
				- cephalic vein is under the pectoralis major, drains into the axillary vein in the triangle region. 
			- subclavius -  inferior to clavicle, deep to pec. 
				- originates 1st costal cartilage insertion into the clavicle to depress it, very small. 
			- all these muscles are enclosed in clavipectoral fascia - forms the ligaments that make the dome of the armpit :p , forms the suspensory ligament of the armpit. 
				- one nrve, the lateral pectoral nerve will come out and supply pectoralis major 
				- thoracoacromial trunk will have some offshoots that pierce the fasica
				- medial pectoral nerve innervates pectoralis minor and the fascia, piercing it 
					- pectoralis minor will only innervate the minor, which would be surprising, but they're just named after the cord of the brachial plexus origin 
			- medial axillary wall = made up of the ribs, **serratus anterior covers the ribs, arises from upper 8-9 ribs + intercostal stuff**
			- serratus anterior - very nice when well developed, arises from slips of 8-9 ribs, from anterior to posterior wraps the cage. keeps the medial border of the scapula TIGHT to thoracic cage. 
				- interesting: instead of on the deep surface, the nerve that supplies it the **long thoracic nerve** is actually on the anterior surface. 
				- injury: winged scapula: when the long thoracic nerve which will be paralyzed and innervating the serratus anterior, this is paralysis of it, since it's from a **blow to the lateral thoracic wall.**
					- we see the medial border of the scapula pull away from the thoracic cage with pressure on the upper limb, preventing arm elevation 
		- lateral wall of axilla: made up by the bicipital groove of humerus, the 2 muscles from the coracoid process: coracobrachialis + biceps brachii
		- posterior axillary wall: 
			- made from subscapularis - originates from subscapular fossa, and then inserts to lesser tuberosity, to medially rotate the arm (all of them do so)
			- teres major - insert on medial lip of bicipital groove 
			- latissimus dorsi - wraps under teres major to insert right ON the bicipital groove. 
			- muscles of hte posterior wall are innervated by the posterior cord of brachial plexus 
				- gives rise to the upper + lower subscapular nerves, which will both innervate the subscapularis
				- recall: lower subscapular n will get the teres major too 
				- thoracodorsal nerve drops down to innervate the latissimus dorsi
				- posterior cord will also give rise to teh axillary nerve, which will leave thru the quadrangular space (still visible in the anterior view)

- sturctures inside the axilla? - part of the brachial plexus is in this space along with other branches and lymphatics. 
	- some mammary glands and also other glands
	- limited by the 1st rib, outer border + teres major 
	- **landmark: pectoralis minor muscle, as it runs thru the insertion, will cover the 2nd part of the axillary artery, and you can trace to the cords of the brachial plexus** 
	- axillary artery 
	- axillary v 
	- brachial plexus
	- lymphatics
	- axillary sheaths
	- fat
