learn: 
- which muscles attach the upper limb to pectoral girdle+axial skeleton
- which bones in the pectoral girdle? 
	- clavicle anteriorly, and then the scapula. = these bear the attachment of the upper limb
		- bone of arm: humerus ; will articulate with acromion and the radius laterally and ulna medially at the elbow joint. 
		- **brachium = arm** 
		- **antebrachium = forearm** 
	- articulations are with the axial skeleton and the arm. 
	1. clavicle - lateral 1/3 is conCAVE anteriorly, which will articulate with acromion, and then the convex medial side, which is 2/3 convex anteriorly for articulation with the sternum and first costal cartilage
		- note: the most frequently fractured bone in the body, this will be at the joint/curve of the S shape 
		- dislocation at the acromion side is very common "shoulder separation"
	2. right scapula: anterior view. dr reaves focused on the posterior [[SFP Superficial Back and Shoulder_Reaves]]
		- inferior angle = where medial/lat meet 
		- medial border extends to the superior border, which also has a notch 
		- subscapular fossa = **concave anterior surface**, will originate the subscapularis muscle
		- medial border anteriorly - for the serratus anterior
			- recall posterior medial border is the insertion for both rhomboids + levator on the medial posterior border
		- note - coracoid process is on the anterior side of this. = a site of origin for some muscles 
	3. the humerus = the proximal end is focused on, be aware that the head is huge and lined with hyaine cartilage
		1. anatomic neck is just below the head
		2. distal to anatomic neck: 2 tubercles
			1. lesser tubercle = directly antriorly 
			2. greater tubercle = directed laterally 
		3. bicipital groove(long tendon of bicep runs along this) /intertubercular groove 
			- many muscles insert upon this groove on diff sides
			- teres major on the medial lip
			- lateral lip pectoralis major 
			- in the middle: latissimus dorsi 
		4. distal to tubercles is the surgical neck, a common place for injuries
- how's the axilla formed? (this is a space) - this has 4 walls and is pyramid shaped. 
- sturctures inside the axilla? - part of the brachial plexus is in this space along with other branches and lymphatics. 
	- axillary artery 
	- axillary v
