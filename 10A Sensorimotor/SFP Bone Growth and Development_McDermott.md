2 mechanisms of bone growth/ossification
1. intramembranous ossification - where osteoblasts diffferentiate within condensations (looks like a membrane) of mesenchyme, making bones **directly** ; skull bones!!!
	- makes woven bone initially, which is later made to make lamellar bone 
	- formation of **primary ossification centers** in the mesenchyme, like the flat bones of skull. genetic programing make cells differentiate into osteoblast cells. 
		- we see swiggles of osteoblasts getting harder.... some lacunae may be layered some aren't. see fibers geing formed, and identification o osteofictaion centers. 
		- basically mesenchymal cells located near periosteal surface condense to make periosteum 
		- continued bone depo -> compact bone formation 
		- in other areas, thicekning of trabeculae doesn't occur, and the CT between -> hematopoetic tissue 
		- woven bone not really well distributed, random still 
	- **osteoid** is made, and made is a woven/immature bone, which is nonlamellar, and are less dense + lack parallel arrangement. 
		- these are not yet calcified 
	- woven bone = first bone tissue to form in embryo and in repair !! but then replaced by lamellar bone with vascular invasion 
		- immature woven bone matrix is wavy and **looks like stains with various degrees of intensity**
		- lamellar bone = stains homogenously and **lacunae tend to align in rows bc of parallel layer positioning** in bone matrix 
	- not only the flat membranous bones of skull; we see these have intramembranous ossification at diaphysis and epiphyses of long bones at the same time as endochondral ossification - **so both occur in longbones, but just the intramembranous occur in membrane bones.**

2. endochondral ossification  "within cartilage" - osteoblasts invade preexisting hyaline cartilage and use it as a **scaffold** to synthesize bone matrix , and then the scaffold is **resorbed and replaced** by bone. 
	- start with development of periosteum and bone collar on each side, near the ends, made by intramembranous ossification
		- they j start to differentiate within that part of the bone 
		- occurs to make the outer portion of bone and thicken the bond by a lot. 
		- once that occurs, BVs willi nvade, making the ossification center, and then the chndrocytes will hypertrophy and then secrete the alk phos 
		- calcify that cartilage matrix, making it hard. 
		- as the chrondrocytes grow, this cartilage will be compressed, which would make spicules smaller, so osteoblasts will sit there and make more and more bone. 
		- then BVs come in to weigh down bones on the cartilage. 
	- hyaline cartilage model with type 2 collagen is REPLACED by bone 
	- cartilage first calcified to make a scaffold, then resorbed + replaced by bone 
		- epiphyseal plate almost stays, which is gonna stay as hyaline cartilage , along with the articular surfaces 
		- start along the middle upwards. 
		- bone can no longer grow in length when u lose most of ur epiphyseal plates, growth plate fusion in adults ): 
	- for development + growth of long bones + short bones
	- 2ndary and primary ossification centers form in these 
		- primary center = **develops in diaphysis, making woven bone using trabeculae of calcified cartilage**
		- secondary: in the epiphyses
	- intramembranous ossification occurs simultaneoulsy underneath periosteum to make collar around the bone and to inc girth 
		- note: bones grow in width by **periosteal/appositional grwoth, involving depo of bone tissue by osteoblasts in the periosteum**
- zones of growing/lengthening bone with epiphyseal plate
1. resting zone = reserve of hyaline cartilage, hich is up top 
2. proliferation zone - dividing chondrocytes that stack up ; matrix is increasing and cartilage is increasing 
3. hypertrophy zone = terminally diff cells making alk phos , come from lacunae + compress the cartilage matrix; chondrocytes will enlarge, and start stacking up.  -> makes the spicules and the scaffold 
4. calcified cartilage zone - calcification of that matrix + death of chondrocytes via apoptosis -> leaves spicules where chondrocytes used to be, 
	1. then the osteoproliferative cells come in 
	2. basicaly know that the chondrocytes die by apoptosis, and then the septa become calcified 
5. ossification zone = bone tissue making by osteoblasts which lay down osteoid on scaffold 
	1. differentiation into osteoblasts, start to lay down bone there 

bone growth - starts at wk 12 of fetus, and continues til early adulthood. 
after birth, bone gets longer via endochondrial ossification, growth at the epiphyseal plates. 
- growing in legnth 
at the same time, we get periosteal grwoth/appositional growth on the width/girth!!!
- basically osteoprogenitor cells in the inner layer of periosteum will prolifrate + differentiate into osteoblasts, depositing compact, lamellar bone on outer surfaces. 
- maintain that cavity in between bc osteoblast will lay down bones on the outside but at the same time, we resorb the bone on the inside, keeping it real and constant. 

remodding of compact bone - when bone reachs full size, outer/inner circumferential lamellae make boundaries of the compact bone with haversian systems
- interstitial lamelllae = remnants of preeixisint gsystems... before haversian ones took place. 
- bone remodding ocurs thruout life 
long bone remodding 
- we can sculpt the epiphyseal plate, to move it up, since cartilage is being replaced on one side and lengthens on the other side. 
- re resorb bc we need to maintain the shape. 


vitamin deficiency
- scurvy =. vita c def, bc we need ascorbic acid for collagen synthesis (cofactor for lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase)
- rickets - vitamin d def, so ca2+ def -> no bone matrix calcification ): 
	- important in kids bc of impact on dev bone growth. 
	- bow leggedness,
	- weak bones 

mech of bone repair
1. fracture hematoma, huge clot surrounds ends of brokenness
2. inflammatory response with many neutrophils + inflammatory mediators -> granuloma tissue
3. granuloma tissue replacement with fibrocartilaginous tissue making a callus 
4. osteoprogen cells in periosteum differentiate into osteoblasts that depo bone on outer surface o f the callus via **intramembranous ossification**
5. the caritlage of the callus itself will be replac and calcified by endochondral ossification 
ofc the periosteum also helps to remodel
