bone pathology 
congenital - 
1. achondroplasia - most common cause of skeletal dysplasia
	1. majority of dwarfism,activate FGFR3 mutation, inhibiting endochondral growth(long bones)
	2. AD inheritance
	3. 90% de novo inc with **paternal age**
	4. shortened extremitiies, enlarged head/bulging forehead, depression of nasal root ; trunk normal sidze
2. osteogenesis imperfecta = common inherited CT disorder
	1. autosomal dom, alpha1/alpha 2 type 1 collagen 
	2. blue sclerae, sensorineural hearing loss, small blue-yellow teeth + **extreme skeletal fragility**
	3. intrauterine fractures since fetushood "blue sclerae and lots of fractures/suspect childabuse"
3. osteopetrosis - 
	1. exception - can be either AD or AR
	2. reduced bone resorption and symmetrical skeletal sclerosis, so **osteoclast impairement**
	3. erlenmeyer flask deformity = **long bones are hard and stonelike but brittle bc they lack the medullary canal and are bubous/misshapen**
	4. we get cranial nerve deficits, anemia, hydrocephalus and renal tubular acidosis
	5. spongey bones not resorbing properly 
	6. no space inside the bone for blood to be made = anemia 

metabolic bone dz
1. rickets/osteomalacia
	1. both are bony manifestatins of vitamin d deficiency, bones too soft
	2. osteomalacia in adults = constant undermineralized remodding = risk of fracture up 
	3. rickets = pediatric, so we get abnormal bone depo in growth plates..
		1. harrison groove ((lateral grooves of ribs seen)) /rachitic rosary , pigeon breast deformiting
		2. frontal bossing
		3. bowing of legs 
2. osteopenia/osteoporosis
	1. osteopenia dec bone mass, 1-2.5 sdevs below mean peak bone mass DXA 
	2. osteoporosis = more severe more than 2.5 stdevs below peak bone mass
	3. primary cause = senile/postmenopausal
	4. secondarry = hyperthyrid, gi, malnutrition, corticosteroids 
	5. clincally = vertebral compression fractures, lordosis/kyphoscoliosis, traumatic fractures
	6. DEXa scan dx. 
	7. treat = exercise, ca/vita d, bisphosphonates, denosumab 
3. hyperparathyroidism 
	1. too much PTH = osteoclast more , more bone resorption/osteopenia
	2. loss of that serum ca feedbakc
		1. primary = autonomous pth, like tumor
		2. secondary = underlying renal dz = dec ca and vita d not converted properly, high phosphate 
		3.
