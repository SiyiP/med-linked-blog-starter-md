bone pathology 
congenital - 
1. achondroplasia - most common cause of skeletal dysplasia
	1. majority of dwarfism,activate FGFR3 mutation, inhibiting endochondral growth(long bones)
	2. AD inheritance
	3. 90% de novo inc with **paternal age**
	4. shortened extremitiies, enlarged head/bulging forehead, depression of nasal root ; trunk normal sidze
2. osteogenesis imperfecta = common inherited CT disorder
	1. autosomal dom, alpha1/alpha 2 type 1 collagen 
	2. blue sclerae, sensorineural hearing loss, small blue-yellow teeth + **extreme skeletal fragility**
	3. intrauterine fractures since fetushood "blue sclerae and lots of fractures/suspect childabuse"
3. osteopetrosis - 
	1. exception - can be either AD or AR
	2. reduced bone resorption and symmetrical skeletal sclerosis, so **osteoclast impairement**
	3. erlenmeyer flask deformity = **long bones are hard and stonelike but brittle bc they lack the medullary canal and are bubous/misshapen**
	4. we get cranial nerve deficits, anemia, hydrocephalus and renal tubular acidosis
	5. spongey bones not resorbing properly 
	6. no space inside the bone for blood to be made = anemia 

metabolic bone dz
1. rickets/osteomalacia
	1. both are bony manifestatins of vitamin d deficiency, bones too soft
	2. osteomalacia in adults = constant undermineralized remodding = risk of fracture up 
	3. rickets = pediatric, so we get abnormal bone depo in growth plates..
		1. harrison groove ((lateral grooves of ribs seen)) /rachitic rosary , pigeon breast deformiting
		2. frontal bossing
		3. bowing of legs 
2. osteopenia/osteoporosis
	1. osteopenia dec bone mass, 1-2.5 sdevs below mean peak bone mass DXA 
	2. osteoporosis = more severe more than 2.5 stdevs below peak bone mass
	3. primary cause = senile/postmenopausal
	4. secondarry = hyperthyrid, gi, malnutrition, corticosteroids 
	5. clincally = vertebral compression fractures, lordosis/kyphoscoliosis, traumatic fractures
	6. DEXa scan dx. 
	7. treat = exercise, ca/vita d, bisphosphonates, denosumab 
3. hyperparathyroidism 
	1. too much PTH = osteoclast more , more bone resorption/osteopenia
	2. loss of that serum ca feedbakc
		1. primary = autonomous pth, like tumor
		2. secondary = underlying renal dz = dec ca and vita d not converted properly, high phosphate 
	3. see it in the femurs and toes, 
	4. brown tumors = not real tumors but microfracture reparative rxn which makes bloody mass (histiocytes, blood, fibrous tissue)
	5. osteitis fibrosa cystica = cystic brown tumor in severe longstanding cases 

non-neoplastic bone dz
1. paget dz = osteitis deformans
	1. pathogenesis possibly genetic SQSTM1 mutation, environmental, or viral
	2. monostotic or polyostotic (multiple cells involved)
	3. leontiasis ossea = lion face shape, with large cheeckbones and jaw 
	4. platybasia = invagination of skull base + posterior fossa compression 
	5. femoral/tibial anterior bowing -> osteoarthritis 
	6. chalk like stick type fractures + vertebal compression fractures
	7. DX: **inc in alk phos, calcium, but normal phosphate** + imaging 
	8. inc risk **osteosarcoma**
	9. TREAT: calcitonin + bisphosphonates 
	10. 3 phases
		1. lytic phases = osteoclast making thinner trabeculae with making resorption pits
		2. mixed phase = osteoblast puts down new bones, but instead of lamellar rearrangement like normal....
		3. we have mosaic cement line pattern = osteosclerotic phase 
2. fractures
	1. loss of bone integrity due to injury or loss of bone strength 
	2. inhibition of healing 
		1. displaced or communated = deformity 
		2. inadequate mobilization 
		3. infection, malnut, osteoporosis, smoking, etc. mostly think neoplasia. 
	- non-union = > basically fracture never comes together, **pseudoarthrosis, a false joint!**
	- just understand overall how bones would heal 
- when u first get a fracture
	- hematoma forms day one 
	- soft callus phase, mesh, progenitor cells, fibroblasts all come in 
	- bone and hyaline cartilage all come into becoming a soft, bony callus
	- within 1 month = we get normal lamellar bone modeling 
3. osteonecrosis - infarction/ischemic necrosis
	1. common to see it in femoral head 
	2. vascular injury, steroids/drugs, systemic dz like sickle cell, radiation, idiopathic ones 
	3. medullary pathophys - **infarc of trabecular bone + marrow, where the cortex is spared due to periosteum blood flow**
		1. can tell the bone is dead bc **no osteocytes are in the bone... in the matrix**
	4. subchondral = wedge shaped necrosis and collapse with cartilage sloughing off 
4. osteomyelitis - pretty common, infection of bone
	1. can be bacterial usually 
		1. hematogenous spread, extension(if they have diabetic ulcer that gets too deep) , direct implantation 
		2. kids = hematogenous
		3. in adults = fractures , surgery, diabetes
		4. most common = S. Auereus 
		5. GBS and e coli in infants
		6. salmonella = **sickle cell**
		7. mycobacterial = spine / pott dz 
		8. n. gonorrhoeae = with sexually active adult
	2. clinical fever, bone pain, lytic focus (abscess/sequestrum, hole in bone) , with surrounding sclerosis 
	3. DX: cultures, radiograph, mri
	4. microscopic = **neutrophil acute, but chronically fibrosis, serous atrophy etc.**

bone tumors
1. osteoma
	1. M>F, adults, skull, jaw, facial bones
	2. gardner syndrome (so many polyps in colon and rectum, inc risk of getting colorectal cancer, a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis FAP caused by the APC gene mutation)
	3. microscopic appearance, circumscribed as hell with mature lamellar cortical bone ; benign 
2. osteoid osteoma  - huge in tests
	1. children/young adults M>F
	2. intense, night pain, **relieved by NSAIDs / aspirin**
	3. femur, tibia, humerus, hands/feet, vertebrae usually mtaphysis cortex 
	4. rdiology = **radiolucent = central ==nidus==, a white area, with a sclerotic ring reaction, which is more gray**
	5. calcified osteoid and woven bone lined by osteoblasts = bgd vascular CT
	6. treat: radiofreq ablation 
3. osteoblastoma. - also benign 
	1. more kids/young adults, M>F
	2. this one is more on the metaphysis medulla rather than cortex
	3. well-defined radiolucent lesion without sclerosis much, which is radiolucent bone 
	4. circumscribed collection of bony **trabeculae** lined by **osteoblasts**, fibrovasc stroma, giant cells 
	5. TREAT: curettage, excision 
4. non-ossifying fibroma - non-bone forming fibrous tumor of the bone
	1. in kids 
	2. eccentric distal femur/proximal tibia metaphysis 
	3. sharply demarcated radiolucent mass, **very thin rim of sclerosis/cortex, usually kids playing soccer then injured randomly, basically tumor's thin cortex popped**
	4. storiform fibrosis, osteoclasts, foamy macrophages, hemosiderin 
	5. TREAT: curettage, excision 
5. osteosarcoma - more malignant now
	1. bimodal, kids and above 40 M>F
	2. femur, tibia, humerus, pelvis, jaw, fibula (metaphysis with medullary spread)
	3. some ppl have predisposition = **paget dz**, chemo/radiation, pre-existing lesions, and foreign bodies 
	4. painful enlarging mass +/-pathologic fracture 
	5. radiology - shows destructive lesion with periosteal reaction 
		1. **codman's triangle** = like a bite mark taken out of the bone on xray 
		2. matrix foramtion - inside lesion and extension ofsoft tissue extension 
	6. we see disorganized non-normal bones, pleomorphic cells admixed unmineralized osteoid... different colored pink. weird
6. ewing sarcoma - soft tissue or bone
	1. in children, M>F
	2. in diaphysis of long bones
	3. **EWSR1 translocation 22....** 
	4. destructive lytic tumor extending into soft tissue, shows a **onion skin tumor**
	5. small round blue cell tumor +/- homer-wright rosettes
		1. similar to neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, etc = other small cell tumors, defined individually by the transoction 
7. metastatic tumors = more common than primary tumors
	1. direct extension growth into there
	2. lymphatic/hematogenous dissemination 
	3. intraspinal seeding - most rare, like nerve tumors
	4. mostly with adults = prostate, breast, kidney , ung 
	5. children = neuroblastoma, wilms, rhabdomyosarcoma
	6. more lesions = multifocal
		1. lytic lesions = hole, breast, renal, myeloma
		2. sclerotic/blastic = bone forming, prostate
		3. mixed too , not all straightforward

cartilage tumors
1. osteochondroma - bone, cartilage, benign 
	1. children. - YA
	2. like you have a mushroom growing out of bone, baby bone
	3. common in cortex, growing out, exophytic osseous with cartilaginaous mass with cap... 
	4. cortical bone with overlying cap 
	5. treat with excision 
2. chondroma/enchondroma - benign 
	1. YA
	2. enchondroma = from medullary vacity, small bones of hand/foot
	3. chondroma = bone surface coming out of , humerus, hand/foot
	4. looks like small circumscribe radiolucent lesion with some endosteal scalloping 
	5. mildly hypecellular mature cartilage
	6. treat with either observation / scurettage 
		1. cartilage looks normal, purpleish , chondrocytes are evenly spaced, and normal 
3. chondrosarcoma 
	1. malignant in adults, only malignant one in adults
	2. pelvis, ribs, femur, humerus, verte, jaw
	3. radiolucent lesion with **calcification** or flocculent densities = usually th gray location - blown thru it and more necrotic. cartilage in between the bone tarbeculae, poking thru with atypical chondrocytes, clumped up and bad  
	4. varied with admixed chondroid matrix
