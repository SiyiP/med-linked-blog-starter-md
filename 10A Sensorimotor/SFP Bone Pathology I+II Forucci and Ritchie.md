bone pathology 
congenital - 
1. ==achondroplasia - most common cause of skeletal dysplasia==
	1. ==majority of dwarfism,activate FGFR3 mutation, inhibiting endochondral growth(long bones)==
	2. AD inheritance
	3. ==90% de novo inc with **paternal age**==
	4. ==thanatophoric dysplasia = lethal variant = frontal bossing, small chst, BELLSHAPED abdomen, short limbs, AD, fetal resp failure== 
	5. shortened extremitiies, enlarged head/bulging forehead, depression of nasal root ; trunk normal sidze
2. ==osteogenesis imperfecta = common inherited CT disorder==
	1. autosomal dom, ==alpha1/alpha 2 type 1 collagen== 
	2. ==blue sclerae, sensorineural hearing loss, small blue-yellow teeth + **extreme skeletal fragility**==
	3. intrauterine fractures since fetushood =="blue sclerae and lots of fractures/suspect childabuse"==
3. ==osteopetrosis - marble bone disease== 
	1. exception - can be either AD or AR
	2. ==due to acidification of osteoclast resorption pit = reduced bone resorption and symmetrical skeletal sclerosis, so **osteoclast impairement**==
	3. ==erlenmeyer flask deformity = **long bones are hard and stonelike but brittle bc they lack the medullary canal and are bubous/misshapen**==
	4. we get c==ranial nerve deficits, anemia, hydrocephalus and renal tubular acidosis==
	5. spongey bones ==not resorbing properly== 
	6. no space inside the bone for blood to be made = anemia 

metabolic bone dz
1. ==rickets/osteomalacia==
	1. ==both are bony manifestatins of vitamin d deficiency, bones too soft==
	2. ==osteomalacia in adults = constant undermineralized remodding = risk of fracture up== 
	3. rickets = pediatric, so we get abnormal bone depo in growth plates..
		1. ==harrison groove ((lateral grooves of ribs seen)) /rachitic rosary , pigeon breast deformiting==
		2. ==frontal bossing==
		3. bowing of legs 
2. ==osteopenia/osteoporosis==
	1. ==osteopenia dec bone mass, 1-2.5 sdevs below mean peak bone mass DXA== 
	2. ==osteoporosis = more severe more than 2.5 stdevs below peak bone mass==
	3. primary cause = senile/postmenopausal
	4. ==secondarry = hyperthyrid, gi, malnutrition, corticosteroids== 
	5. clincally = vertebral compression fractures, lordosis/kyphoscoliosis, traumatic fractures
	6. ==DEXa scan dx.== 
	7. treat = exercise, ca/vita d, bisphosphonates, denosumab 
3. hyperparathyroidism 
	1. too much PTH = osteoclast more , more bone resorption/osteopenia
	2. loss of that serum ca feedbakc
		1. primary = autonomous pth, like tumor
		2. ==secondary hyperparathyroidism = underlying renal dz = dec ca and vita d not converted properly, high phosphate== 
	3. see it in the femurs and toes, 
	4. ==brown tumors = not real tumors but microfracture reparative rxn which makes bloody mass (histiocytes, blood, fibrous tissue)==
	5. ==osteitis fibrosa cystica = cystic brown tumor in severe longstanding cases== 

non-neoplastic bone dz
1. ==paget dz = osteitis deformans==
	1. ==pathogenesis possibly genetic SQSTM1 mutation, environmental, or viral==
	2. ==monostotic or polyostotic (multiple cells involved)==
	3. ==leontiasis ossea = lion face shape, with large cheeckbones and jaw== 
	4. ==platybasia = invagination of skull base + posterior fossa compression== 
	5. ==femoral/tibial anterior bowing -> osteoarthritis== 
	6. ==chalk like stick type fractures + vertebal compression fractures==
	7. ==DX: **inc in alk phos, calcium, but normal phosphate** + imaging== 
	8. ==inc risk **osteosarcoma**==
	9. TREAT==: calcitonin + bisphosphonates== 
	10. 3 phases
		1. ==lytic phases = osteoclast making thinner trabeculae with making resorption pits==
		2. mixed phase = ==osteoblast puts down new bones,== but instead of lamellar rearrangement like normal... ==we have mosaic cement line pattern = osteosclerotic phase== 
		3. 4th stage = quiescent - minimal osteoblast/clast acitivty 
2. fractures
	1. loss of bone integrity due to injury or loss of bone strength 
	2. inhibition of healing 
		1. displaced or communated = deformity 
		2. inadequate mobilization 
		3. infection, malnutrition, osteoporosis, smoking, etc. mostly think neoplasia. 
	- ==non-union = > basically fracture never comes together, **pseudoarthrosis, a false joint!**==
	- just understand overall how bones would heal 
- ==when u first get a fracture==
	- ==hematoma forms day one== 
	- ==soft callus phase, mesh, progenitor cells, fibroblasts all come in== 
	- ==bone and hyaline cartilage all come into becoming a soft, bony callus==
	- within 1 month = ==we get normal lamellar bone modeling in 1 mon== 
1. ==osteonecrosis - infarction/ischemic necrosis==
	1. common to ==see it in femoral head== 
	2. vascular injury, steroids/drugs, systemic dz like sickle cell, radiation, idiopathic ones 
	3. ==medullary pathophys - **infarc of trabecular bone + marrow, where the cortex is spared due to periosteum blood flow**==
		1. can tell the bone is dead bc **no osteocytes are in the bone... in the matrix**
	4. ==subchondral = wedge shaped necrosis and collapse with cartilage sloughing off== 
2. ==osteomyelitis - pretty common, infection of bone==
	1. ==can be bacterial usually== 
		1. ==hematogenous spread common in kids, extension of ulcer maybe or smth==(if they have diabetic ulcer that gets too deep) , direct implantation 
		2. kids = hematogenous
		3. ==in adults = fractures , surgery, diabetes==
		4. ==most common = S. Auereus== 
		5. ==GBS and e coli in infants==
		6. ==salmonella = **sickle cell**==
		7. mycobacterial = spine / pott dz 
		8. ==n. gonorrhoeae = with sexually active adult==
	2. clinical ==fever, bone pain, lytic focus (abscess/sequestrum, hole in bone) , with surrounding sclerosis== 
	3. DX: cultures, radiograph, mri
	4. microscopic = **neutrophil acute, but chronically fibrosis, serous atrophy etc.**

bone tumors
1. ==osteoma==
	1. M>F, adults, ==skull, jaw, **facial bones**; head and neck==
	2. ==gardner syndrome (so many polyps in colon and rectum, inc risk of getting colorectal cancer, a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis FAP caused by the APC gene mutation)==
	3. microscopic appearance, ==circumscribed as hell with mature lamellar cortical bone ; benign== 
2. ==osteoid osteoma  - mainly appears in diaphysis of long bones, immature woven bones==
	1. ==children/young adults M>F==
	2. ==intense localized, night pain, **relieved by NSAIDs / aspirin**==
	3. femur, tibia, humerus, hands/feet, vertebrae usually metaphysis cortex 
	4. ==radiology = **radiolucent = central nidus, a white area, with a sclerotic ring reaction, which is more gray**==
	5. ==calcified osteoid and woven bone lined by osteoblasts = bgd vascular CT==
	6. ==treat: radiofreq ablation== 
3. ==osteoblastoma. - also benign, **mainly in vertebrae**== 
	1. ==more kids/young adults, M>F==
	2. this one is more on the ==metaphysis medulla rather than cortex==
	3. ==well-defined radiolucent lesion without sclerosis much, which is radiolucent bone== 
	4. circumscribed collection of ==bony **trabeculae** lined by **osteoblasts**, fibrovasc stroma, **giant cells==** 
	5. TREAT: curettage, excision 
4. ==non-ossifying fibroma - non-bone forming fibrous tumor of the bone==
	1. in ==kids== 
	2. ==eccentric distal femur/proximal tibia metaphysis== 
	3. ==sharply demarcated radiolucent mass, **very thin rim of sclerosis/cortex, usually kids playing soccer then injured randomly, basically tumor's thin cortex popped**==
	4. ==**storiform** fibrosis, osteoclasts, **foamy** macrophages, hemosiderin== 
	5. TREAT: curettage, excision 
5. ==osteosarcoma - more malignant now, mainly in knee==
	1. ==bimodal age distrib==, kids and above 40 M>F
	2. femur, tibia, humerus, pelvis, jaw, fibula ==(metaphysis with medullary spread)==
	3. some ppl have ==predisposition = **paget dz**, chemo/radiation, pre-existing lesions, and foreign bodies== 
	4. ==painful enlarging mass +/-pathologic fracture== 
	5. radiology - shows ==destructive lesion with periosteal reaction== 
		1. ==**codman's triangle** = like a bite mark taken out of the bone on xray== 
		2. ==matrix foramtion - inside lesion and extension of soft tissue extension== 
	6. we see disorganized non-normal bones, pleomorphic cells admixed unmineralized osteoid... different colored pink. ==weird = **pink, lace-like osteoid production, pleomorphic, highly cellular and atypical mitoses** or sunburst appearance on the xray!!!==
6. ==ewing sarcoma - soft tissue or bone==
	1. ==in children, M>F==
	2. ==in diaphysis of long bones==
	3. ==**EWSR1 translocation 22....**== 
	4. ==destructive lytic tumor extending into soft tissue, shows a **onion skin tumor**==
	5. small ==round blue cell tumor== +/- ==homer-wright rosettes==
		1. similar to neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, etc = other small cell tumors, defined individually by the transoction 
7. ==metastatic tumors = more common than primary tumors==
	1. direct extension growth into there
	2. lymphatic/hematogenous dissemination 
	3. ==intraspinal seeding - most rare, like nerve tumors==
	4. ==mostly with adults = prostate, breast, kidney , ung== 
	5. ==children = neuroblastoma, wilms, rhabdomyosarcoma==
	6. more lesions = multifocal
		1. ==lytic lesions = hole, breast, renal, myeloma==
		2. ==sclerotic/blastic = bone forming, **prostate**==
		3. ==mixed too , not all straightforward==

cartilage tumors
1. ==osteochondroma - bone, cartilage, benign== 
	1. ==children. - YA==
	2. like you have a ==mushroom growing out of bone, baby bone==
	3. common in cortex, growing out, exophytic osseous with cartilaginaous mass with cap... 
	4. ==cortical bone with overlying cap== 
	5. treat with excision 
2. ==chondroma/enchondroma - benign== 
	1. ==YA==
	2. ==enchondroma = from medullary, central of bones, small bones of hand/foot==
		1. ==**maffucci syndrome** - multiple enchondromas + hemangiomas, inc. risk for dev of other types of malignancies== 
		2. ==ollier dz = 90% of the cases with multiple enchondromas, preferencia for one side of body== 
	3. ==chondroma = speicifcally coming out of bone surface, humerus, hand/foot==
	4. looks like ==small circumscribe radiolucent lesion with some endosteal scalloping== 
		1. ==mildly hypecellular mature cartilage==
	5. treat with either observation / scurettage 
		1. ==cartilage looks normal, purpleish , chondrocytes are evenly spaced, and normal== 
3. ==chondrosarcoma== 
	1. ==malignant in adults, only malignant one in adults==
	2. pelvis, ribs, femur, humerus, verte, jaw
	3. ==radiolucent lesion with **calcification** or flocculent densities = usually th gray location - blown thru it and more necroti==c. cartilage in between the bone tarbeculae, poking thru with atypical ==chondrocytes, clumped up and bad==  
	4. entrapment of normal trabeculae in cartilage. 
	5. varied with admixed chondroid matrix 

----
childhood MSK conditions
1. radial head subluxation - nursemaid's elbow = the distal radius pulling causes portion of **immature annular ligament to slip over head of radius and slide onto radiohumeral joint**
	1. will show kid holding affected arm close to body w elbow extended or slightly flexted + forearm pronated. 
	2. not in pain just not using arm 
	3. ==treat by reduction - hyperpronation or supination/flexion==
2. ==tibial tuberosity avulsion / asgood-scholatter dz== = traction apophysitis of ==prox tibial tubercle at insertion of patellar tendon==
	1. ==overuse injury putting stress on tibial tubercle via repetitive contraction of quad muscles== 
	2. ==athlete thing==
	3. rapid growth spurt, 9-14 , 2x more common with sports, assymetric mainly 
	4. ==progressive anterior knee pain and swelling at tibial tubercle==
	5. ==relieved by rest==
	6. dx - ==tenderness w soft tissue or bony prominence of tibial tubercle== - pain reproduced by ==extending knee against resistance, right at the tubercle.== 
	7. ==benign and self-limited, 6-18 mon or until closure of this growth plate, pain controol, pt, etc. sometimes activity continue.  but some fragmentation of the tibial tubercle ):== 
		1. often times might as well get an **xray** bc of this. 
3. ==palletofemoral pain syndrome PFPS== 
	1. ==soft tissue swelling; overuse disorder with pain around the patella.== 
	2. ==anterior knee pain mainly active female adolescents, one or both knees==
	3. aggravated by loading the pf joint during ==weight baring on flexed knee like with squatting, running, etc.== 
	4. dx plain films might be used ... but this is clinical, and by activity mod, NSAID, physical therapy 
4. ==developmental dysplasia of the hip.== 
	1. looking for symmetry. if you don't see it, look at what doesn't match 
	2. spectrum of conditions related to hip dev in infants and newborns 
	3. think ==breech presentation, also getting them in childhood with kids not getting to milestones;== spend too long sitting, etc not building up muscle 
	4. ==abnormal dev of acetabulum and prox femur = mechanical instability of hip joint== 
	5. infants = ==newborn dislocation ; might see asymmetrical thigh folds== in a newborn when picking up their legs and holding them down 
	6. RF = ==breech== at any time, and family hx of dev hip dysplasia 
	7. children = ==trendelenburg gait==, where you have a **hip drop off the opposite side of the weak muscle** - super subtle 
	8. ==clunk on ortolani barlow maneuver!!! = slipping in and out of joint== 
	9. US dx until 3 month of age typically in 6wks of age, and radiograph for older than 3 mon ;
	10. ==pavlik harness given to them as a treatment when we see it as they're young== 
5. ==legg calve perthes disease= **avascular necrosis of femoral head**==
	1. ==idiopathic avascular necrosis of femoral head==
	2. ==saw in 3-12 peak 5-7== 
	3. ==mostly unilateral, mainly male==
	4. ==limp of **insidious onset over months gradually**==
	5. ==trendelenburg gait with **pain to anteromedial thigh/knee.**==
	6. ==limited internal rotation and abduction of hip== 
	7. note: **inital radiographs can be normal; so exam poz, but ==xrays are subtle, but ultimately assymetrical.== refer to peds orthopaedist**
		1. they can splint the leg and hold in place so BVs can fix themselves 
6. ==slipped capital femoral epiphysis - non symmetric, looks like golf ball vs melted golf ball==
	1. the ==epiphysis slips posteriorly -> limp and impaired internal rotation== 
	2. due to inc axial force on femoral head, this will displace. =="ice cream fall off cone"==
	3. ==obese== child in early adolescence, 12-13 yo, male uusally 
		1. ==acute hip pain + limp... pain localizes to knee or thigh== 
		2. ==more acute than insidious== like the avascular necrosis of femoral head. 
		==needs operational stabilization== 

common fractures
- think about force and patterns 
- ==axial force = up and down, hitting right on that axis.== 
	- ==causes buckle/torus fracture of radius==
		- stable compression fractures at distal metaphysis where **bone is most porous**
		- bulges out like a little torus/greek column... 
		- treat with short splint but mainly pain relie and comfort for healing 
- ==bending force = foce applied at an angle === 
	- ==greenstick fracture of radius,== 
		- ==incomplete fracture of the **tension side (where that force is hitting) of the cortex of the radius/ulna with buckling of the compression side**==
		- need to give immobilization in short arm cast or splint 4-6 wks .. but unstable and may continue to displace post casting 
	- plastic deformation of ulna

==salter harris = **fracture at the growth plate**==
- ==this is specific to peds, some other ones that might go on ur peds rotation specifically==
