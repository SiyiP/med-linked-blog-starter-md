heritable disorders 
tissue types - epithelial, muscle, nervous + connective 
function of stucture, protection, transport + immune deffense
- loose + dense CT - dermis, tendon
- cartilage, bone, adipose, blood 

in the matrix we have - fibroblasts prodominantly ; adipocytes, mesenchymal cells , immune etc. 
- ground substance= gel like matrix, rich in proteoglycans + gags
- fibers - collagen, elastic, reticular = different types 

collagen fibers 
- most abundant vertebral protein, making strong insoluble fibers
- made by fibroblasts
- **a single collagen = 3 polypeptide chains in a right handed triple superhelix**
collagen syn
1. pre-pro collagen made by tripeptide repeat - Gly-proline-Lysine or gly-X-Y= **translation of collagen alpha chains**
2. backbone goes thru hydroxylation with OH on X and Y positions
	1. this is important bc **lysyl hydroxylase req vitamin C, which means the deficiency leads to scurvy and we see mucosal ulcerations + whorled hair...**
	2. genetic defect -> **ehlers-danlos syndrome**
3. glycosylation of hydroxylysine groups , sugar added 
4. then we form **procollagen via h and di-sulfide bones, making triple helix of 3 collagen alpha chains**
	1. **osteogenesis imperfecta = problems forming the triple helix**
5. exocytosis 
6. now we're in Extracellular space:  the tropocollagen is made by end cleavage of N/C terminals by proteases 
7. collagen fibril forms by crosslinking **hydroxylysines, which copper is required as a cofactor of. for lysyl oxidase**
	1. lack of copper = **menkes disease = poor collagen formation**
types of collagen  
- type 1 most common - thick rope like bundles, bones , fascia, tendons, teeth, etc 
	- **defective in osteogenesis imperfecta, triple helix procollagen making issues**
- type 2 - absorb shock, spongey in cartilage and nucleus pulposus
- type 3 - reticulum in web sustaining forces in many directions like granulation tissue in wound repair, skin, blood vessels
	- early wound repair before conversion into type 1 
	- **defective in ehlers danlos type 4**
- type 4 - basement membrane in kidney, ear, eyes, skin etc. 
	- defective in **alport's syndrome** (hereditary nephritis, deafness, ocular disturbance)
	- **goodpastures syndrome makes antibody to these in glomerular capillaries**

case 1 - eyes glassy, blue sclera, multiple bone fractures 
- **osteogenesis imperfecta, brittle bone dz**
- type 1 collagen defective =fragile bones 
	- very fragile 
	- most common - ==mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2== AD -> decreased prod of structureally normal collagen 
	- less common - **hydroxylase enzyme impairment of triple helix stability**
	- AD, misdx as child abuse. 
	- in AR versions, typically involve non-cllagen genes, the rest of the types but clinically resemble type 3/4 
	- subtypes 1-4 - **not in order... ):**
		- 1 = mild, blue sclerae, freq fractures
			- type 1A = wihtout dentinogeneiss imperfecta, which is the teeth 
			- type 1B = with DI
			- minimal bone deformity, just freqent fracutures , joint laxitiy and muscle weakness too 
			- also hearing loss 
			- normal cognitive dev 
			- **wormian bones - cracks in the skull as they're trying to form** 
		- 2 = **most severe**, perinatal lethality 
			- caused by new dom mutations in COL1A1 and or COL1A2 
			- many fracutres + **severe bone deformity**
			- in utero fractures with callus formation 
			- intrauterine growht restriction IUGR
			- skull large for body size with wormian bones 
			- **dark blue sclerae, frog leg posture with short bowed limbs**
			- **death from pulm hypoplasia + rib fractures**
		- 3 = severe but non-lethal =progressive deformities
			- short stature 
			- dark sclerae
			- can be de novo mostly but sometimes AR
			- detinogenesis imperfecta common 
			- variable life expectancy , resp failure common 
		- 4 = moderate, bone deformities with normal sclerae 
			- short stature, normal life , etc. 
	- TEST: COL1A1/A2 , test for type 1 and 2 are the most sensitive 
	- TREAT: with **bisphosphonates, orthopedics early, mobility aids, monitor hearing + dental + pulm, get multidisciplinary care**

case 2 veryyy hyperflexible + easy bruising 
1. ehlers danlos syndrome 
	- classic types - I + II
		- skin, joints and heart valves involved
		- easy bruising
		- **velvety hyperextensible skin with cigarette paper scarS?**
		- **type 5 collagen defect**
		- ==these have COL5A2 and COL5A2== AD
	- hypermobility type - type 3 
		- hypermbility joint pain and mitral valve prolapse and easy bruising 
		- **most common and least severe**
		- don't know genes/proteins but AD probabily 
		- joint instability and bc joints are just moving all the time, cause **chronic pain**
	- vascular type type 4 
		- thin skin, visible veins, distinctive face... 
		- rupture of large vessels/viscera 
		- **type 3 collagen impact**
		- ==COL3A and COL1A1, think of the 3 and <3 heart vascular focus. AD associated with arterial fragility with aneurysms and rupture ): ==
		- 50% de novo tho ... very high risk for pregnancy 
		- TEST: with gDNA sequencing, negtive result will rule this out 
			- genetic testing - rec if any major or minor criteria present... severla minors esp in pts less than 40 y/o 
- beighton scoring system - measure joint hypermobility - this is huge for seeing hyperextension , giving some points. doens't tell us about EDS, but about hypermobility 

case 3 
- very tall guy , concave chest, elongated fingers, superiorly displaced lens with blurry vision and dad died young due to aortic dissection 
1. marfan's -
	- tall, scoliosi
	- big concerns w blood vessels
	- distinguishing point can be **intraocular lens dislocation + ocular hypertension and flat feet**
	- Autosomal dom, but 25% from de novo
	-
