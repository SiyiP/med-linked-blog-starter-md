spine/anatomy of spine aKA vertebral column 
- complex mechanic due to coordinated action of vertebrae + intervertebral discs
- ligametns
specifically on vertebrae - on the anatomy of back [[SFP Deep Back, Vertebral Column, Spinal Cord_Visconti]]
- the spinous process, what you feel 
- pars interarticularis = mass of bone between superior + inf artiular processes, the neck of boney mass. 
	- **this is the site of spondylolysis**
- facet joints - the true articular joints bt sup/inf articular processes which connect these. 

what questions to ask for low back pain? 
- pain, swelling, warmth, redness = all indicates inflammation
- injury/trauma?
- acute <6 wks, subacute 6-12 wks, and chronic back pain 12+ wks... back pain can also be referred from another serious med illness. 

==red flags of low back pain , good to know for clinicals. - raise concern for serious pathology that's not msk/routine limited== - review this slide!
- trauma
- unexplained weight loss 
- age 50+ 
- fever/infection 
- immunosuppression like with IVDU and or steroid use too 
- ==syncope== 
- hx of cancr
- ==weakness/bowel or bladder dysfunction==
- pain at night/at rest
- pain lasting 1+ mon or not responsive to treatment 
signs on physical exam
- weird vitals
- motor weakness
- ==saddle anesthesia - numbness/tingling in groin area== 
- urinary retention 
- loss f rectal tone
- abnormal reflexes,
- ==pain on percussion of spinous processes== 

1. compression fracture - compression/coollapse of vertebral body , classified by percent height loss
	1. acute = back pain post sudden bending or axial load/smoosh 
	2. more insidious due to osteoporosis 
	3. DX: Xray 
	4. treatment: non-op, meds, activity modding but no bedrest, brace maybe, treat unerlying osteoporosis if possible. only surgery after failing conservative acute treatment  in 6-12 mon 
2. herniated disc 
	1. vertebral disc will bulge + pop out in the internal core! comes into contact with nerve = **radiculopathy, radiating nerve pain**
	2. like back and leg pain!!! numbness, tingling or weakness.
	3. location of leg pain maps to speciic n on **dermatomal** map
	4. most commonly bt l4/5 is the nerve L5 compression 
	5. between L5 and S1, usually S1 bc L5 already exited before the disc. 
	6. Dx clinical + hx, but no need for mri unless red flag... 
	7. treat - non-op bc the disc will resorb back.rough 6 weeks. only surg for significant weakness/cauda equina 
	8. L5/S1 most common impacted![[dermatomes of lower limb.jpeg]]
3. lumbar strain/sprain/mechanical low back pain 
	1. 85% of ppl with low bakc pain have this
	2. nonspecific no specific pathology 
	3. worse w movement, no tenderness over midline, etc. 
	4. just clinical dx, imging only with worry on alternative dx,,, 
	5. non=surg/conservative with activity modding like no heavy lifting, oral + topical meds needed. 
4. spinal stenosis - narrowing of spinal canal/**vertebral foramen due to bony/soft tissue structures being degen**
	1. older guys, no injury 
	2. vague low back pain, butt, leg pain, generally better **leaning forward as it opens that canal space.** ppl get relief leaning forward onto the grocery cart 
	3. neurogenic claudication - **thigh and leg pain worse with walking improves with rest.**
	4. dx - MRI - we need to **see the 3D full imaging to see everything and confirm . **
	5. TREAT: non-surg, PT, but surgery if prog disabling pain that failed or if progressive neuro defects. 
5. spondylolysis/spondylolithesis - continuum of disease
	1. not spondylosis !!!1 (this is arthritis in spine)
	2. these are instead on a spectrum... getting spondylolysis and THEN getting spondylolisthesis
	3. spondylolysis = **fracture of pars interarticularis**
	4. spondylolithesis = progression to **slippage and sliding** of one vertebral body anterior to the adjacent one below it!!! slipping forward. this is **most common in pars of L5 and anterolisthesis of L5 relative to s1**
	5. not an acute injury, maybe a stress response to extension, ==**low back pain in adolescent or older kid**==
	6. generally - Xray is go-**to scotty dog sign**, oblique view, CT, MRI 
	7. treat - nno-op 
6. cauda equina syndrome - look into treatment specifically, not quite important for the rest 
	1. a syndrome, but severe compression of **nerve roots in thecal sac of lumbar spine... most commonly due to acute lumbar disc hrniatin**
	2. sudden pain, worse than the ones they usually have
	3. acute back + leg pain with saddle paresthesias
	4. **bowel + urinary retention/overflow incontinence... and bowel dysfunction / fecal incontinence**
	5. difficult on peeing and pooing self
	6. **super emergent - early dx is critical with mri is confirm is huge.**
	7. TREAT: urgent surgical dcompression to open that space up in 24 hours to show the nerves 

Case 1 - 
- felt pop when picking up couch, tingling down back of l leg = lumbar strain with disc herniation 

case 2 = 86 yo , forgot to use walker, but fell back onto wooden chair, immediate backpain hard to walk 
- compression factor = sudden axial spine load 

case 3 - insidious, a gymnast, denies injuries, worse with floor + beam routines, practices a lot , 11 yo 
- spondylolysis - in extension based sports. + very competitive overuse injuries
- rule of thumb - we need to hold someone from the sport ):
