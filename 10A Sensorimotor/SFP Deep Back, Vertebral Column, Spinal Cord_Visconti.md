==33 vertebrae, 24 "true"== bc separate from one another and not isolated (==12 thoracic, 7C, and 5lumbar==), ==remaining 9 is 5 sacral and 4 coccygeal== (fused into the sacrum and coccyx respectively)
- axial support, connects head + pelvis, protects spinal cord (runs in center), segmental distribution of nerves, muscle attachments, etc. 

there's ==2 concavities = in thoracic + sacral regions = primary curvatures== bc **present at birth**
**post** birth the infant will get ==2 convexities at cervical + lumbar regions = secondary curvatures==

typical vertebra - anterior body, foramen, and vertebral arch (made of 2 pedicles), then posterior to those 2 laminae (connection to the spinous process)

typical vertebra has 7 processes
- midline 1 spinous process
- 2 transverse processes
- 4 articular processes, 2 superior (articulates with vertebra above), 2 inferior 
	- will be covered with hyaline cartilage, allows for smooth articulation with intervertebral disk 
	- facets also at tip of these allowing for smoother movement at points of contact 
oblique view of vertebras might look at pathology of the processes, pedicles etc. 
- we can see the scotty dogs drawn in this configuration 
- dog = transverse process
- nose = 
- eye = pedicle
- pars interarticularis = neck of the dog, most injured one 


intervertebral disc = when we're young, this shock absorbs + allows movement + helps us cushion. 
- central portion of this = nucleus pulposus = gel cushion , water, proteoglycans
- ==annulus fibrosis = surrounds it, fibrocartilage, rich in collagen T1 , orthagonally arranged around nucleus, oriented in many directions = allows for **shock absorption**== 
	- **more thick anteriorly** 
- dec in water with age. 

==CERVICAL vertebrae - **foramen seen in transverse process , foramen transversarium**== 
- ==passage of vertebral vein thru all 7 C vertebrae, and artery passes thru upper 6== 
- ==groove seen on very sides anterior for a spinal nerve; rests in the groove upon exit thru intervretebral foramen== 
- ==uncinate process = associated with surface of disk (recall uncinate process of pancreas, looks like HOOK esp on the side)==
- spinous processes are BIFID (looks like tail) except for C1/7 
- foramen large and triangular. 
- superior articular processes face **up and slightly back, and inferior face down + forward to make articulations**
- ==intervertebral joints = **due to the uncinate process, looks like it's hooked and a smily face**==
- ==cervical spinal nerves = move out in horizontal fashion== 
- superior articular FACETS will articulate with inferior articular facets to make **facet joints**
	- on a film = we see radiography www.rad.washington.edu
C1+2. = atypical compared to C3-7
- ==C1 = no vertebral body nor spinous process = **has anterior and posterior arch with superior articular surfaces covered with hyaline cartilage to occipital condyles (base of skull), allows for moving of the skull while we nod**==
- ==C2 = has an odontoid process, at superior processs / dens, projecting superiorly to atrticulate with anterior arch of the atlas of C1.== 
	- on the slides. - a cool radiograph of a patient with their mouth open, with the top of C2 with the dens up, going into the C1  = atlanto-axial
		- ==atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial joints==
	- ==no intervertebral disk located between c1+C2 bc of this!== 
	- ==dens of this axis will articulate with the posterior aspect of the atlas's anterior arch== 
	- note: ==cruciate ligament of 3 parts , for movement of head shaking "no"== 
		- ==transverse ligament of atlas==
		- ==superior + inferior longitudinal bands (stabilizes association of dens of axis w/ anterior arch of atlas)==


thoracic vertebra
- body is medium size, <3 shape!
- vertebral foramen small + circular
- spinous process = on each one is long and **inclined downward**
- ==thoracic vert: on each side of vertebal body - has costal articular surfaces/facets to articulate with head of matching rib== 
- ==and costal facet on transverse processes for articulating with the tubercle of matching rib==
- ==note T11-12 no facets for tubercle of ribs on transverse bc "floating ribs"==
- superior articular facets face back + lateral
- inferior articular facets face front and medial 

lumbar 
- large body and bean shaped 
- foramen is triangular 
- laminae thick, strong pedicles!!!! very dense 
- transverse processes are relatively more slender
- ==lumbar has mammallary processes (diagonal ish, next to the spinous process) on end of articular facets and accessory processes on the posterior of the transverse processes==
	- ==these are for connections of muscles of the deep back== (not seen in anatomy lab bc they have a prosection)
- superior articular processes face medial, inferior face laterally 
- intervertebrae foramina created by juxtapoz of pedicles of lumbar above + below separated by intervertegral disc... 
- ==spinal nerves **exit in downward formation**== 

- **lumbar vertebral ligaments**
	- ==anterior longitudinal ligament will run thru length of anterior vertebral body== 
	- ==posterior longitudinal ligament on the posterior part of vertebral body = smaller than the broad anterior one , at **midline of posterior body** with horizontal portions that **incompletely** covers intervertebral space.== 
		- ==so if you get a HERNIATION of the disc, its more likely to be a posterior lateral==  
	- ==ligamentum flavum = extends **between** adjacent laminae along the length of spinal cord and bc of this connection, this will prevent hyperflexion of spinal cord!!==
	- ==interspinous ligament = between spinal processes==
	- ==posterior surface of the spinous processes = **supraspinous ligamen**t, which will expand into the ***ligamentum nucae* in the cervical region!**==

all the different orientation of articular surfaces set up mobility and range of motion on which part of the spine it's in!

sacrum 
- fused 5 sacral
- wedge shaped 
- anterior concavity (primary curves)
- superior articulation L5-S1, with intervertebral disk 
- inferior articulation with coccyx
- lateral articulation with iliac portion of pelvic bone
- sacral promontory S1 (posterior margin on pelvic inlet)
- fusion of vertebral foraminal = sacral canal 
- anterior + posterior sacral foraminae , allows for ventral/dorsal primary rami passage

==spinal cord==
- ==has 2 enlargements cervical C5-T1 and lumbosacral L2-3== 
- ==31 pairs of segmental spinal nerves==; as we go down, our nerves leave more down and out 
	- 8 C - ==C1-7 leave the vertebral column **above** the matching vertebra,==
		- leaves in ==horizontal trajectory== 
		- ==C8 will exit below c7 vertebra, supterior to T1== 
	- ==all others = will exit below numbered vertebrae==
	- 12T - exit below their numbered vertebrae 
	- 5Lumbar exit below their numbered vertebrae 
	- 5S - S1-4 ; exit below their numbered vertebrae , pass thru sacral formina, ==but S5-1C will pass thru sacral canal / fused cavity== 
	- ==1 Coccygeal exit below their numbered vertebrae== 
- ==composed out white (myelin/axons) and gray matter inside (bodies)==
- anterior and posterior median sulcus , then dorsal, ventral, lateral horns = this is all dr. hohn.
	- each spinal nerve is attached to spinal cord by ==ventral root = motor==
	- and ==dorsal root = sensory== 
	- ==length of root increases from C-L==
	- recall: ==conus medullaris at tapered cone of L1, and then the cauda equina== 
- spinal cord enclosed in meninges like in the brain!
	- dura mater. - most tough outer layer , from foramen magnum to the 2nd sacral vertebral (encloses the cauda equina too)
	- ==arachnoid== =- delicate impermeable membrane, deep to dura mater. ==separated from internal layer, pia mater, by subarachnoid space filled with CSF==
	- ==pia mater== = deepest, vascularized membrane, direct contact with cord, ==ending at L1 with **filum terminale**, which are CT  that will extend into the sacral vertebra inside the dura sack. then continue beyond dural sack to attach to coccyx== , (outside of dural sack = filum terminale exum?)
		- ==denticulate ligaments extend laterally from dura, which will separate ventral from dorsal roots and anchor pia mater to dura mater== 
- blood supply to spinal cord = from 3 main 
	- ==2 posterior spinal aa and anterior spinal a==
	- ==radicular arteries from segmental spinal artery will enter thru intervertebral foramina to anastomose with anterior/posterior spinal aa== 
	- ==paired vertebral aa from *aorta*: intercostal + lumbar arteries!!! ==
- venous drainage
	- ==valveless veins, internal vertebral plexus + external vertebral venous plexus==
	- ==internal vertebral venous plexus is in the foramen but OUTSIDE dura mater!== 
		- this drains basivertebral veins, which will drain body of vert, empties into intervertebral veins, communicating with vert, intercostal, lumbar veins 

distal end
spinal cord stops at tip of L1 or upper L2. 
- terminates at tapered cone = conus medularis
- from that point onwards, ==**dorsal + ventral roots will go below L**1 = looks like a horse tail!== 
	- ==cauda equina, made up of dorsal + ventral roots== 

lumbar disc protrusions - can have herniated disk 
- ==in case of L4-5 injury , we see L5 spinal nerve becoming irritated.== 
	- ==bc the L5 is going downwards, passing by that interdisk space.== 
- ==in herniations of C4, 5, we see C5 compressed it's horizontally going out==

==in sacral ones, L5-S1 disc - 1st sacral nerve root.... will see it being pinched.== 
- ==we see this bc of the downward trajectory in the lumbar region and down== 

==deep back muscles/true back muscles=== **we will not see these!**
==erector spinae ; all innervated by dorsal primary rami of the spinal nerves ; all postural.== 
- ==spinalis medial==
- ==longissimus - lateral more== 
- ==iliocostalis - the most lateral==
=="SLI from the midline"==

==transversospinalis - also all postural, helps us rotate our trunk== 
- ==semispinalis==
- ==multifidus== 
- ==rotatores = most lateral of all these== 

==intertransversarii + interspinales = hardest to see ; again postural and helps allow rotation== 
- ==between adjacent transverse processes==
- ==between adjacent spinal processes== 

---
lumbar puncture - ==to get CSF==
- ==best area is L3/4 or L4/5 intervertebral space = safest bc **spinal cord terminates with L1 , and even tho we got cauda equina, our needle will push that aside**==
- lay on side, in baby position to palpate the iliac crest as a ref point., ligaments (supraspinatous, interspinatis, and ligamentum flavum) -> the extradural space, then puncture the dura, then the filum terminale to harvest fluid
