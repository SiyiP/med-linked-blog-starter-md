**this lecture is rlly good bc she bolds important words** 

peripheral neuropathy 
clinical manifestations
- motor: weakness
- sensory: slow progression + symmetrical mostly with stocking/glove distrib - most common , some effect on **longest nerves of body first before other effects, which goes to fingers/toes first**
- loss of **deep tendon reflexes, lesion anywhere in reflex arc**
- autonomic symptoms possible - common w/ diabetes- postural hypotension, anhidrosis, weak bowel/bladder sphincters, impotence, unreactive pupils
indications = 
- ==usually biopsy of **sural nerve, a sensory nerve but we get motor types of insertions**==
- ==- **vasculitis = muscle biopsy useful**==
- amyloid = genetic tests 
- granulomatous dz - very seldom impacts nerves, leprosy tho maybe 
- confirm inflammatory process - any time it's inflammatory, it's **patchy, you can miss it. so that's why u get the muscle biopsy**
- diabetes - most often, most often classic, but if they have atypical/assymmetrical, in whcih you then biopsy the sural nerve to make sure 
acquired rzns
- **diabetes** - distal symmetric/stocking-glove + autonomic or atypical presenttion 
- vitamin def, systemic dz, **alcohol** 
- **drugs like supplements**, heavy metals, toxins(chemo), chemical s
inflammatory rzns - infection, autoimmune, **vasculitic**
misc: **amyloid**, paraneoplastic, compression 
hereditary reasons for this too!!!

paraffin section nerves = pinkish , larger piece of tissue , meant to find anything inflammatory 

we then take little pieces of tissue and put them in resin / plastic - embeded vesicles of nerves, quote a few of them 
- in high powered plastic embedded, we can see individual fibers and myelin , axons, schwann cells etc.

thinly myelinate = sensory 
thin/small = sensory autonomic mixture usually 
thickly myelinated = motor 

peripheral nerve rxns to injury 
- it dies back when ts hurt
- peripheral ones can regrow mroe than the central ones 
- axonal degeneration 
	- general event - nutritional or intoxication 
	- focal event = wallerian degeneration - it dies back 
	- secondary demyelination - making all myelin disappear is more secondary 
	- and then it will regrow/regenerate guided by schwann cells, sprouting and remyelinate it 
- segmental demyelination - primary demyelination - where you get the bit of myelin hurt or injury to myelin sheath / schwann cell loss **schwann cells wrap the myelins**

axonal degen acutely 
- big thick myelin fibers, but **no small myelinated ones**
- areas with secondary myelin degen = **dark circle filled in, no axon in the middle seemingly**

later loss of myelinated fibers 
- get big thick axons again - 
- yet the mylin layers aren't that thick in comparison to the normal ones. 
- myelin thin for that size of axon!!! 

sprouting = multipel little spots, with tiny little fibers where one axon should be 
- looks like mushroom succulents and stuff
- as a peripheral n tries to regrow, it follows schwann cell sheaths , and then the **one spout who gets there first ones, nd the others die back off!** sorta like sperm + egg

teased fibers = to tell the diff bt these nerves growing or something
- separating out each axon /: 
- lay it out on the slide to check for segmental demyelination (see thinness on some rope)\

diabetic nerve
- sensory - stocking glove autnomic 
- if asymm, consider biopsy 
- **loss of more small thinly myelinated/sensory fibers**
- **thick-walled nerve and vessels!!! seen! what happened with thickened segmental vessels is that our smaller sensory fibers are gone**

vasculitis
- basically occlusion of bv, fibrinoid necrosis, perivasc inflammation 
- types: polyarteritis, sle, etc 
- *painful* **asymmetric mixed sensory (usually) + motor**
- **patchy too - so do both nerve/peroneal nerve instead of sural + muscle gastrocnemius biopsy**
\

amyloid
- mixtur of **sensory + autonomic dysfunction**
- start distally , feet + **carpal tunnel type syndromes**
- disorders of peirpheral n are the most common with systemic amyloidosis 
- **al amyloidosis most common type of acquired amyloidosis polyneuropathy**
[[*C- WBC disorders]]
[[-SFP White Blood Cells I-IV_Rinker]]
"AL amyloid - abnormal amyloid is from the plasma cells which make that abnormal protein, which then are deposited = recall congo red stain apple green 
	- median survival 2 yrs"

amyloid = is smudgey and gray or light blueish, used to be pink in the H+e
- there's gonna be seen in nerve + vessel, and nerve loses more of the small myelinated ones 


guillian barre syndrome GBS 
- acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy 
- clinical 
	- rapidly progressive
	- can happen bc they get vaccinated or bc they got the
