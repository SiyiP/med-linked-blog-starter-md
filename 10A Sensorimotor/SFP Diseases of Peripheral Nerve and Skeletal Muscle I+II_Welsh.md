**this lecture is rlly good bc she bolds important words** 

peripheral neuropathy 
clinical manifestations
- motor: weakness
- sensory: slow progression + symmetrical mostly with stocking/glove distrib - most common , some effect on **longest nerves of body first before other effects, which goes to fingers/toes first**
- loss of **deep tendon reflexes, lesion anywhere in reflex arc**
- autonomic symptoms possible - common w/ diabetes- postural hypotension, anhidrosis, weak bowel/bladder sphincters, impotence, unreactive pupils
indications = 
- ==usually biopsy of **sural nerve, a sensory nerve but we get motor types of insertions**==
- ==- **vasculitis = muscle biopsy useful**==
- amyloid = genetic tests 
- granulomatous dz - very seldom impacts nerves, leprosy tho maybe 
- confirm inflammatory process - any time it's inflammatory, it's **patchy, you can miss it. so that's why u get the muscle biopsy**
- diabetes - most often, most often classic, but if they have atypical/assymmetrical, in whcih you then biopsy the sural nerve to make sure 
acquired rzns
- **diabetes** - distal symmetric/stocking-glove + autonomic or atypical presenttion 
- vitamin def, systemic dz, **alcohol** 
- **drugs like supplements**, heavy metals, toxins(chemo), chemical s
inflammatory rzns - infection, autoimmune, **vasculitic**
misc: **amyloid**, paraneoplastic, compression 
hereditary reasons for this too!!!

paraffin section nerves = pinkish , larger piece of tissue , meant to find anything inflammatory 

we then take little pieces of tissue and put them in resin / plastic - embeded vesicles of nerves, quote a few of them 
- in high powered plastic embedded, we can see individual fibers and myelin , axons, schwann cells etc.

thinly myelinate = sensory 
thin/small = sensory autonomic mixture usually 
thickly myelinated = motor 

peripheral nerve rxns to injury 
- it dies back when ts hurt
- peripheral ones can regrow mroe than the central ones 
- axonal degeneration 
	- general event - nutritional or intoxication 
	- focal event = wallerian degeneration - it dies back 
	- secondary demyelination - making all myelin disappear is more secondary 
	- and then it will regrow/regenerate guided by schwann cells, sprouting and remyelinate it 
- segmental demyelination - primary demyelination - where you get the bit of myelin hurt or injury to myelin sheath / schwann cell loss **schwann cells wrap the myelins**

axonal degen acutely 
- big thick myelin fibers, but **no small myelinated ones**
- areas with secondary myelin degen = **dark circle filled in, no axon in the middle seemingly**

later loss of myelinated fibers 
- get big thick axons again - 
- yet the mylin layers aren't that thick in comparison to the normal ones. 
- myelin thin for that size of axon!!! 

sprouting = multipel little spots, with tiny little fibers where one axon should be 
- looks like mushroom succulents and stuff
- as a peripheral n tries to regrow, it follows schwann cell sheaths , and then the **one spout who gets there first ones, nd the others die back off!** sorta like sperm + egg

teased fibers = to tell the diff bt these nerves growing or something
- separating out each axon /: 
- lay it out on the slide to check for segmental demyelination (see thinness on some rope)\

diabetic nerve
- sensory - stocking glove autnomic 
- if asymm, consider biopsy 
- **loss of more small thinly myelinated/sensory fibers**
- **thick-walled nerve and vessels!!! seen! what happened with thickened segmental vessels is that our smaller sensory fibers are gone**

vasculitis
- basically occlusion of bv, fibrinoid necrosis, perivasc inflammation 
- types: polyarteritis, sle, etc 
- *painful* **asymmetric mixed sensory (usually) + motor**
- **patchy too - so do both nerve/peroneal nerve instead of sural + muscle gastrocnemius biopsy**
\

amyloid
- mixtur of **sensory + autonomic dysfunction**
- start distally , feet + **carpal tunnel type syndromes**
- disorders of peirpheral n are the most common with systemic amyloidosis 
- **al amyloidosis most common type of acquired amyloidosis polyneuropathy**
[[*C- WBC disorders]]
[[-SFP White Blood Cells I-IV_Rinker]]
"AL amyloid - abnormal amyloid is from the plasma cells which make that abnormal protein, which then are deposited = recall congo red stain apple green 
	- median survival 2 yrs"

amyloid = is smudgey and gray or light blueish, used to be pink in the H+e
- there's gonna be seen in nerve + vessel, and nerve loses more of the small myelinated ones 


guillian barre syndrome GBS 
- acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy 
- clinical 
	- rapidly progressive, **ascending motor issue**
		- please dx this be4 they will have it to their chest and stop breathing 
	- can happen bc they get vaccinated or bc they got the dz they shoulda been vaxxed for 
	- CSF has inc prtein , but no inc in cellularity
		- bc not an infection 
	- nerve conduction velocity NCV slowed... **bc you're losing myelin**; no axons affected usually, just demylinating  
- etiology - autoimmune 
	- after vax or infection
- treat: supportive: autoimmune syndromes to get to the point where they start remodeling their myelins 
	- plasmapheresis 
	- immunoglobulins 
- differential: chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy 
- we see **segmental demyelination, inflammation of nerves with many mostly macrophages**- they are wiggling themselves into the myelin sheath and trying to unwrap the myelins 

chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy 
- more common 
- more worsening **muscle weakness, more pain/sensory problems like numbness, loss of reflexes**
- autoimmune + acquired
- **slowly progressing long term symptomes**
- mosty older men 
- TREAT: steroids, IVIG, plasma ex, other immuontherapy 
- histo: **onion bulbs** 

hereditary neuropathies
categories/combos 
- hereditary motor+sensory neuro
- - hereditary sensory neuro
	- sensory symptoms: numbness, tingling, pain in feet/hands
-  hereditary motor neuro
	- motor symptoms: weakness/atrophy
- hereditary sensory + autonomic neuro
	- autonomic syndromes: sweating, bp like postural hypotension, insensitivity to pain 
- additionally : 
	- many bone and soft tissue issues come with hereditary neuropathies 
dx and treat of hereditary neuropathies
- hx + fmhx 
- exam
	- nerves might become palpable on exam in hypertrophic neuropathy 
- lab investigations:
	- EMG - electromyography 
	- NCV - nerve conduction velocity 
	- genetic testing is huge
	- almost never biopsy 
- symptomatic treatment for pain + contractures 
- hypertrophic neuropathy
	- onion bulbs around the axons - **those are redundant layers of schwann cells around axons**

types
- charcot-marie-tooth
	- 
- dejerine-sottas
	- 
- familial amyloid polyneuropathy 


skeletal muscle- 
practical but not on boards
- which muscle do we biopsy ?
- muscle that is involved, not endstage
- but not the muscle where EMGs (needle stick) were done
- typically these are **quadriceps and occasionally biceps**

paraffin muscle = hard to tell where fibers are 
frozen muscle = easier to see, size and shape edges.... fresh muscle is frozen and we can see size/shape 
	fresh frozen muscle stains: 
	- enzyme stains like NADH... blue, seeing type 1 fibers as oxidative, and type 2 for the rest of the stains 
	- getting mosaic normal fiber typing 
		- **mosaic typing = note that muscle fibers don't know what type they are but the nerves tell them. we're not poultry with white and dark meat, so it's interwoven**
	- can look at all these smaller blue dots = mitochondria , so we know it's type 1 
	- ATPase diferent shades of brown too 
consider 
- age of onset, milestones, progression of symptoms 
- patterns of muscle weakness/wasting? axial, prox, distal
- pattern of weakness progression? 
- any reflexes different? 
- contractures of the tissue/scarring/fibrosis? skeleton weirdness? cataracts? heart? 
- involvement of CNS?

skeletal muscle dz categoreis
- neurogenic = CNS/PNS seconary issues
	- cNS: central motor neuron dz 
		- adults have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/lou gehrig dz = ALS 
			- distal weakness, **no pain, fasciculations, enzymes might be fiarly normal**
			- EMG shows fibrillations (EMG form of fasciculations), sharp waves, fascciculations 
			- TREAT: some cases are genetic with SOD1 or C9orf72 ... but there's an **antisense oligonucleotide to stop some symptoms and slow down progression. not a cure**
		- kids have spinal muscular atrophy = weakness, tremors, dev developmental delays, contractures in joint, bone deformities 
			- TREAT: insufficient survival motor neuron SMN protein due to loss of function gene, so they use adeno-associated virus vector based therapy or some SMN2 directed antisense oligonucleotide 
	- peripheral neuropathies - moto, sensory, autonomic combo of deficits 
	- for any neurogenic muscle pathology: 
		- we see: **angular atrophic fibers**
			- basically if you lose a nerve, the fibers that were innervated by something atrophy and get skinny, long, angular, **compressed by others**
			- little groups of small skinny fibers , small little dots. 
		- type grouping
			- if nerves recover, you might have another neuron take over the innervation that once went to the specific cells... and a whole chunk of it would be a same fiber type
			- if you see hypertrophy of fibers being compensatory near where you see atrophy, you'd know that it's in the child and not an adult. 
		- grouped atrophy when it's been going on long enough
			- if dmg continues , that entire group or type would be erased 
![[Screenshot 2025-09-05 at 5.56.28 PM.png]]
		- inc central nuclei when we innervate denervated muscles 
- neuromuscular junction = myasthenia gravis / lambert-eaton 
	- symptoms tend to fluccuate 
	- defective neuromuscular transmission 
	- LEMS/lambert eaton 
		- **small cell cancer surface antigens - small cell cancer of LUNG making things, paraneoplastic syndrome is common**
		- producing voltage gated Ca channel antibodies , reacting with normal channels in nicotinic + muscarinic presynaptic nerve terminals
		- autoimmune dz of **presynpatic NMJ**
		- **larger muscles like beginning in upper legs, arms, then move onto respiratory**
		- weakness on muscle exam is disproportionally mild to symptomatology severity. 
		- **areflexic!!!!!**
	- myasthenia gravis - **anti-acetylcholine receptor**/anti-muscle-specific tyr kinase antibody being made 
		- **small muscles tire easily, worse later in the day = droopy eyelids/ptosis, diplopia/blurry/double vision**, fatigue, facial changes as exam goes on, problems talking, etc, weaknes sin **fingers**
		- very often = **thymus is abnormal with thymoma or hyperplasia**= maybe some tumor or cell growth, they'll need to have this removed
		- EMG = progressive decrmeents in AP potentials 
		- tensilon given? not rlly done anymore
		- TREAT: pyridostigmine, steroids, immunosuppressants 
- myopathic - suspect these if **weak + PAIN in upper arms, shoulders, thighs** - maybe a long hx or not progressive. most have **CK elevations** due to necrosis and dead myocytes
- they have in common: 
	- degeneration/necrosis (pinkish fibers) , 
	- phagocytosis with macrophages eating dead fibers, 
	- regeneration(seen where the fibers would migrate into the center of fiber and inc in size, cyt gets blue, and big nucleoli instead of just in the edges), 
		- central nuclei can bee seen with re-innervation and regeneration in myopathy
	- "round" atrophy 
	- fibrosis 
- some types have inflammation/motheaten changes, other have hypertrophy similar to peds issues and splitting 
	- inflammatory - biopsies seen most freq here
		- weakness, pain inc CK 
		- cellularity in the muscle fibers
		- types are dermatomyositis
			- painful rash in face, or around joints. might find vasculitis there
			- **association with cancer = workup needed**
			- TREAT: **steroids**
			- angular atrophic fibers are instead **around the periphery of the muscle fascicle = perifascicular atrophy**
			- inflammation in perimysial (around fascicle fibrous tissue)
		- inclusion body myositis 
			- more **distal upper extremity + quadriceps** = so wrist and hand issues not typical of other myopathies
			- rimmed vacuoles are seen = these are seen as inclusion bodies
			- little inflammation once they occur + **steroid unresponsive**
		- immune mediated necrotizing - many fibers are necroti
			- very high CK
			- **proximal msucle weaknes,s more of the quads**
			- very associated with **statins used to manage cholesterol, look for anti-HMGCR**
			- or other anti-SRP autoantibodies
			- cancer possible 
			- viral infections
			- CT diseases
			- might response to steroid/immunesuppressants 
	- t2 atropy - groups of small angular fibers which are all type 2 
		- causes by **disuse, CT disease, PREDNISONE,**
	- musculodystrophy
	- mitochondrial myopathy
	- metaboic myopathies like enzyme deficiencies
	- channelopathies
	- congenital myopathies
