segmentation + limb dev I-II

initiation of limb dev
- implantation and division of zygote in the beginning of the 1st 2 weeks 
- then after the first two weeks, the **main embryonic period in weeks happens (weeks 3-8)**
- at the start of the main embryonic period, the CNS starts dev
- intense change in dev = bud and upper limb around **week 4**
- lower limb around **week 5**
- first 4-5 weeks = **very sensitive, but stays sensitive til week 8**
- forlimb buds appear between wks 4-5 , and then by 5 wks, hindlimb buds are visible 
	- **fingers + toes at 8 weeks**
	- nails become visible at -16 weeks. 
axes in embyonic development
1. PD = proximal distal axis, from the body (shoulder/hip) to away from the body, the tips of fingers/toes
2. anterior posterior - AP : radioulnar/cranialcaudal. = from **thumb to the little finger in the upper limbs, anterior to posterior**
3. dorsal-ventral axis - DV = dorso-volar .... **back of head = dorsal or back of hand to the palm, which we imagine as the ventral.**

limb buds = extension of **somatopleure, outgrowths of lateral plate mesoderm covered by ectoderm.** mesoderm surrounding the notochord, and then embryo is folding, and then the lateral plate mesoderm in blue with the ectoderm.. **will develop the limbs**
- growth of limb buds = due to **mesenchyme prolif**
- forelimbs dev next to C5-T2 somites, which are paired mesoderm blocks that make the vertebrae, skeleton etc. (eventually myotomes dev from these)
- hindlimb buds next to L2-S2 somites
- signals - coordinate growht + dev along the 3 key axes , each controled by distinctive signalling 

outgrowth of limb buds: proximo-distal axis
- pop it out from the neural tube and then grow it towards the ectoderm 
- **homeobox genes regulated by retinoic acid signalling to start telling growth factors**
	- ==tbx5 = forelimbs and tbx4 hindlimbs initiate limb dev by triggering signalling cascade==
	- they promote expression + secretion of **fibroblast GF FGF10 in mesodermal cells**
	- FGF10 acts on **ectoderm making it produce FGF-8 which results in positive feedback loop between the 2**
	1. pathology: **amelia** = lack of tbx5 or tbx4 early... **lack of ENTIRE limb**
	2. **meromella** = lack of PART of the limb 


outgrowth of limbs
- apical ectodermal ridge - proximo-distal axis
	- thickened ridge of ectoderm...
	- oriented in the AP axis, ==induced by opposing expression of r-Fng (radical fringe, on dorsal part of structure) and En-1 (engrailed-1, on ventral part)==
		- En-1 eventually inhibits the r-Fng, so you get the border to develop! 
		- this creates the ridge = **like the border of the flipper, a guide so that limb can develop in that direction.**
	- makes FGF-8 and FGF-4 - reciprocal signaling with underlying mechanism 
	1. patho: absnce of r-Fng, En-1 and AER are amelia
	2. mutations in AER **after its formation**, we see arrested development from that point forward, but **can be rescued by exogenous FGF**
	3. multiple AER made - caused by **ectopic FGF, multiple initiation of limb bud is diplopia**
- progress zone - proximo-distal axis 
	- see this flipper and area to the head near the top and the bottom one lower on the picture..., and then we  take a cross section near the base,
	- **immediately deep to the AER... area with actively dividing cells.**
	- colaborates with the AER in the limb dev but in the proximo-distal axis thru the signalling molecules. expression of transcription factors and the underlying mesoderm 
	- eventually these 2 areas limb growth will support each other on that proximo-distal axis. 
- anterior posterior patterning: zone of polarizing acitivty - ZPA
	- from thumb to little finger/pososterior
	- ==ZPA makes **sonic hedgehog (Shh)** morphogen establishing **gradient** critical for digital identity and number. ZPA will induce AER formation==
		- ==high concentraitions Shh = posterior digits==
		- low or absent shh = anterior digits like thumb 
	- the ulna + **high concentration Shh places** 2-5 digits come first, then radius + thumb. 
	- retinoic acid => **stimulating Shh expression, defining the ZPa development region** (remember ZPA is a location/signalling center, corresponding to RA, Shhh and FGF-4)
	- putting a 2nd ZPA to anterior limb bud makes mirror img duplications of limb structures. due to high sonic hedgehong on both sides, making the gradient bad. 
	1. this is **polydactyly**, sometimes a 2ndary AER coming into it  

feedback loops + interplay 
- FGF10 from mesenchym -> induces FGF8 in AER , which maintains FGF10 expression from ectoderm, making outgrowth poz feedback loop 
- Shh from ZPA regulates **gremlin, which inhibits BMPs**, allowing FGF4 expression into the aER 
- Wnt7a from dorsal ectoderm activates lmx1b in dorsal mesenchym, making the dorsum identity clear all while En1 represses it ventrally.

hox genes = segmental org
- limb field spec 
	- AP axis control - with hox genes expressed in nested domains along the body, giving positional identity 
	- forelimb v hindlimbs
		- hox4-5 gives **permissive signals for forelimb formation**
		- hox6-7 = **cues that specify forelimb location n lateral plate mesoderm**
	- limb segment identity 
		- stylopod = hox9 yellow,10 browtn ; the forearm  
		- zeugopod hox 11 orange = ulna 
		- autopod hox12 blue,13 dark red  = bones of hand 
![[homeobox gene limbs.jpeg]]
	1. patho any mutations in HOXD13 in humans = make digits **polysyndactyly** - more than usual finges, and some of them are **fused together.**
morphogenetic control of early limb dev - 
- molecular signals in limb dev - for dorsoventral patterning 
	- ==Wnt7a (**expressed on the dorsal ectoderm**) will activate **Lmx1b** (on the dorsal mesenchyme.....== 
	- ==and then En1 represses the Wnt-7a ventrally.== 
	- makes so that dorsal ones commanded by the wnt7a will make nails, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and
	- ventra structures = expressed by the En1 and protected, fatty , thicker skin (special crease for grip) and more sweat glands 

chronological order of gene activation in limb dev

- cell death + dev of digits

dev of limb tissues

neural tube in middle
and somites from mesoderm 
neural crest = from the top of the neural tube
lateral mesoderm = the driver of limb dev 
STAGES of limb dev
- bud in end of wk 4
- paddle in wk 5 
- digital rays wk 6
- apoptosis of notches bt digital rays wk 7 
- elongation of digits/separation in wk 8 
in order:  
2. lateral plate mesoderm 
	- cartilage bone joints - limb bone from lateral plate mesoderm
		- where mesenchymal condensations happen under influence of **bone morhpogenic proteins BMPs**
		- from prox to distal seq
		- encochondral ossification - first cartilage and then the osteoid 
		- **postaxial structures differentiate before the preaxial - meaning the sides that are close to the ulna / the posterior side develops before the radius / anterior side** 
	- joint formation - also from this plate
		- as th precartilage grows, there's a zone of cell density in the middle. 
		- this middle place is a line of cell necrosis at **higher cell density zones**, usage of ,,==gdf-5 and noggin==, causing necrosis as the BMP continues to grow both the ends. 
		- this cell space gets moddeled with more ECM remodding, with loose connective tissue, and then mesenchyma condensation makes joint capsule, ligaments , tendons, 
		- instead eventually the secondary ossification cetners move onto the bone development at the epiphysis 
	- BVs - rbcs and stuff comes from **pre-existing BVs froom that aorta = angiogenesis mostly**
		- sprouting from aorta + cardinal veins 
		- capillary networks will come together to make larger ones 
		- primary axial a will give out the brachial a, ulnar, interosseus a... and radial a is the last, bc recall that **dev starts on post-axial area of limb**
3. myotome cells - areas that develop from somites(of the paraxial mesoderm), become muscles during week 5... 
	- from paraxial mesoderm, the somites will be there, and then myotome develops from them and eventually by **week 5 will migrate into the limb bud, making 2 muscle masses**
	- dorsal muscle mass
		- upper limb = extensors, ==supinators==
		- lowr limb = extensors, ==abductors== 
	- ventral muscle mass
		- upper limb = flexors, ==protonators==
		- lower = flexors + ==adductors== 
	- location = ultimately determines cell fate 
4. motor nerve axons  
	- from neural tube, straight down 
5. sensory N axons
	- from NCCs, moving alnog the motor nerve axons in their path , enters along with them. 
	- upper limbs get C5-T2 
	- lower limb = L2-S2 ; looks split and messed up and confusing. 
6. other NCCs
	- melanocytes
	- schwann cells - makes myelin sheath 
dermatomes 
- skin region innervated by sensory fibers from a single spinal nerve's dorsla root - can b used to id spinal cord injury 

dev of digits
in the limb, there's some digital rays
- in these areas of digit growth - the AER is maintained with FGF-8 production 
- in finger web areas = AER regresses , regions of apoptosis 
- so mesenchymal cndensations that lead to pre-cartilages ECM eventually makes boney strcutures of limbs ... they develop in the inside of the digits as bones 
- basically the retinoic receptor B will come in 
1. syndactyly - the fusion of fingers, if the apoptosis doesn't happen. often combined with an extra bone as we discussed before as HOXD13 mutations cause polysyndactyly 

limb rotation 
- important to understand bc of how lower limb dermatomes are organized!!!
- upper limbs - will move a bit towards the belly of the embryo with the dorsum. and the proximal part will roatate laterally = eventually hands will rest in front of the embryo
- on lower limbs = plantar surface will rest more on the anterior facing ... and knees are more lateral, so 90 degree rotation of legs medially 
![[fetal limb rotation.jpeg]]
- baby arms rotate laterally out, thumb will fact belly  
- baby legs rotate in , feet will be dorsal surface facting forward 
![[dermatomes of lower limb.jpeg]]
![[dermatomes of upper limb.jpeg]]

limb anomalies 
- amelia- absence of entire limb... 
- acheiria / apodia - loss of hands/feet
- phocomelia - shortening of prox limb segments (hands are growing out of the prox part of limb)
- hemimelia - absence of preaxial/postaxial parts o limb 
- meromelia - general term for absence in part - any part 
- ectrodactyly - absence of number of digits, any number
	- "lobster claw, claw instead of hand bc of missing central digits" -   
Ectrodactyly, also known as split-hand/split-foot malformation, is characterized by:
	- A deep central cleft in the hand or foot
	- Absence of central digits (commonly the third digit)
	- Fusion or malformation of the remaining digits
-  polydactyly - excessive digits - a mirror img seen , maybe another ZPA , sonic hedgehog signalling issue? 
- syndactyly - presence of interdigital webs
	- decreased apoptosis 
- brachydactyly - short digits - 
	- think impacted by hox genes = hox 13 = best for outgrowth. 
- split foot / hand = no central components 
- adactyly - loss of all digits on limb 

impact of pysical environment
- lack of mobiilty = thought to adversely affect joint dev
- not anough amniotic fluid- see amniotic bands impat limb dev and viability when wrapped around head/neck , blood flow obstruction
- clubfoot= caused by limited mobiity to fetal hindlimb? restrition of hind limb growth in fetus
meds/drugs
- limb defects
- **dilatin/phenytoin usage = fetal hydantoin syndrom**
	- neurological, minor syndromes of newborn, limb abnormalities are often part of a syndrome. 
genetic causes 
==tbx molecules = transcription factors that allow dev of forearm==
hoxA13 - like polydactyly or synpolydactyly 
sonic hedgehog molecule - in extra digits + webbing for poly syndactyly 
FGFR  mutations = seen in syndactyly and brachydactyly
