segmentation + limb dev I-II

initiation of limb dev
- implantation and division of zygote in the beginning of the 1st 2 weeks 
- then after the first two weeks, the **main embryonic period in weeks happens (weeks 3-8)**
- at the start of the main embryonic period, the CNS starts dev
- intense change in dev = bud and upper limb around **week 4**
- lower limb around **week 5**
- first 4-5 weeks = **very sensitive, but stays sensitive til week 8**
- forlimb buds appear between wks 4-5 , and then by 5 wks, hindlimb buds are visible 
	- **fingers + toes at 8 weeks**
	- nails become visible at -16 weeks. 
axes in embyonic development
1. PD = proximal distal axis, from the body (shoulder/hip) to away from the body, the tips of fingers/toes
2. anterior posterior - AP : radioulnar/cranialcaudal. = from **thumb to the little finger in the upper limbs, anterior to posterior**
3. dorsal-ventral axis - DV = dorso-volar .... **back of head = dorsal or back of hand to the palm, which we imagine as the ventral.**

limb buds = extension of **somatopleure, outgrowths of lateral plate mesoderm covered by ectoderm.** mesoderm surrounding the notochord, and then embryo is folding, and then the lateral plate mesoderm in blue with the ectoderm.. **will develop the limbs**
- growth of limb buds = due to **mesenchyme prolif**
- forelimbs dev next to C5-T2 somites, which are paired mesoderm blocks that make the vertebrae, skeleton etc. (eventually myotomes dev from these)
- hindlimb buds next to L2-S2 somites
- signals - coordinate growht + dev along the 3 key axes , each controled by distinctive signalling 

outgrowth of limb buds: proximo-distal axis
- pop it out from the neural tube and then grow it towards the ectoderm 
- **homeobox genes regulated by retinoic acid signalling to start telling growth factors**
	- ==tbx5 = forelimbs and tbx4 hindlimbs initiate limb dev by triggering signalling cascade==
	- they promote expression + secretion of **fibroblast GF FGF10 in mesodermal cells**
	- FGF10 acts on **ectoderm making it produce FGF-8 which results in positive feedback loop between the 2**
	1. pathology: **amelia** = lack of tbx5 or tbx4 early... **lack of ENTIRE limb**
	2. **meromella** = lack of PART of the limb 


outgrowth of limbs
- apical ectodermal ridge - proximo-distal axis
	- thickened ridge of ectoderm...
	- oriented in the AP axis, ==induced by opposing expression of r-Fng (radical fringe, on dorsal part of structure) and En-1 (engrailed-1, on ventral part)==
		- En-1 eventually inhibits the r-Fng, so you get the border to develop! 
		- this creates the ridge = **like the border of the flipper, a guide so that limb can develop in that direction.**
	- makes FGF-8 and FGF-4 - reciprocal signaling with underlying mechanism 
	1. patho: absnce of r-Fng, En-1 and AER are amelia
	2. mutations in AER **after its formation**, we see arrested development from that point forward, but **can be rescued by exogenous FGF**
	3. multiple AER made - caused by **ectopic FGF, multiple initiation of limb bud is diplopia**
- progress zone - proximo-distal axis 
	- see this flipper and area to the head near the top and the bottom one lower on the picture..., and then we  take a cross section near the base,
	- **immediately deep to the AER... area with actively dividing cells.**
	- colaborates with the AER in the limb dev but in the proximo-distal axis thru the signalling molecules. expression of transcription factors and the underlying mesoderm 
	- eventually these 2 areas limb growth will support each other on that proximo-distal axis. 
- anterior posterior patterning: zone of polarizing acitivty - ZPA
	- from thumb to little finger/pososterior
	- ==ZPA makes **sonic hedgehog (Shh)** morphogen establishing **gradient** critical for digital identity and number. ZPA will induce AER formation==
		- high concentraitions Shh = posterior digits
		- low or absent shh = anterior digits like thumb 
	- the ulna + **high concentration Shh places** 2-5 digits come first, then radius + thumb. 
	- retinoic acid => **stimulating Shh expression, defining the ZPa development region**
	- putting a 2nd ZPA to anterior limb bud makes mirror img duplications of limb structures. due to high sonic hedgehong on both sides, making the gradient bad. 
	1. this is **polydactyly**, sometimes a 2ndary AER coming into it  

feedback loops + interplay 
- FGF10 from mesenchym -> induces FGF8 in AER , which maintains FGF10 expression from ectoderm, making outgrowth poz feedback loop 
- Shh from ZPA regulates **gremlin, which inhibits BMPs**, allowing FGF4 expression into the aER 
- Wnt7a from dorsal ectoderm activates lmx1b in dorsal mesenchym, making the dorsum identity clear all while En1 represses it ventrally.

hox genes = segmental org
- limb field spec 
	- AP axis control - with hox genes expressed in nested domains along the body, giving positional identity 
	- forelimb v hindlimbs
		- hox4-5 gives **permissive signals for forelimb formation**
		- hox6-7 = **cues that specify forelimb location n lateral plate mesoderm**
	- limb segment identity 
		- stylopod = hox9,10
		- zeugopod hox 11
		- autopod hox12,13


morphogenetic control of early limb dev - 
- molecular signals in limb dev - for dorsoventral patterning 
	- ==Wnt7a (**expressed on the dorsal ectoderm**) will activate **Lmx1b** (on the dorsal mesenchyme.....== 
	- ==and then En1 represses the Wnt-7a ventrally.== 
	- makes so that dorsal ones commanded by the wnt7a will make nails, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and
	- ventra structures = expressed by the En1 and protected, fatty , thicker skin (special crease for grip) and more sweat glands 
- cell death + dev of digits
