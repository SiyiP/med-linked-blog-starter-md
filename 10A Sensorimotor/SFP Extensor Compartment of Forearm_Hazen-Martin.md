![[10. Extensor Compartment of the Forearm_Hazen-Martin_NOTES (1).pdf]]

posterior = extensor 
- include: muscles of the lateral component
- posterior largely innervated by the **posterior interosseus nerve** which is a deep br of radial nerve
- lateral compartment = ennervated by the radial n. 
12 muscles in total 
- 2 lateral to radius bone ; both superficial 
- 10 posterior to radius, ulna, and interosseus membrane
blood supply - lateral is radial artery 
posterior is posterior interosseus artery which is a **branch of common interossueus**
	interosseus membrane in the posterior side = subdivides posterior group into a deep and superficial compartment

superficial layer - radial to ulnar  - these 7 muscles of this layer come from the supracondylar ridge or lateral epicondyle. 
1. brachioradialis (latera)
	1. different functions, crossing elbow joint but not wrist 
	2. from the upper 2/3 of lateral supracondylar ridge, descnding to the styloid process of radius... 
	3. this causes flexion of forearm at elbow, assists in rotating forearm to **midprone position from full prone, a normal position at rest**
	4. innervation by radial nerve C5-7  - straight off it, before it branchs!!!
	5. "beer drinking motion" 
	6. reflex of C6 testing - strike with mallet to test C6 
		1. C5 test with bicep tendon 
		2. C7 test with tricep tendon 
2. extensor carpi radialis longus (latera) - carpi - extends at wrist , on the radial side 
	1. extends hand at wrist 
	2. from lower 1/3 of lateral supracondylar ridge, inserting into the posterior base of 2nd metacarpal!!!!
		1. on the anterior/flexor side, you have only 1 that went to 2 and 3 - this is flexor carpi radialis 
		2. on this side, you have this that only goes to 2nd metacarpal 
	3. nerve supply the radial n C6-7 bc it's in the lateral compartment. 
	4. **complete wrist drop if you dmg the radial nerve because of this!** 
3. extensor carpi radialis brevis
	1. extends hand at wrist 
	2. originates from lateral epicondyle. the common tendon to insert into the posterior base of the 3rd metacarpal 
	3. extends and abducts hand at wrist 
	4. supplied by DEEP br of radial n C7/8
4. extensor digitorum 
	1. muscles extend fingers 
	2. also from lateral epicondyle, then runs down to **split into 4 tendons, each into a tendon**
	3. extends all 4 fingers, allowing it to attach to base of middle and distal phalanx, so **extension of both PIP and DIP**
	4. deep br of radial nerve 
	5. this will go down posterior to surface of metacarpal, and the CT will expand into an extensor hood, which will attach to transverse carpal ligament between knuckles to keep this in line! 
		1. the expansion will give rise to continuations of tendons in parts: 
		2. central band attaching to base of middle phalanx 
		3. 2 lateral bands to base of distal phalanx 
	6. left alone, causes extensions of all these joints. 
	7. but lumbrical muscles which are from the **profundis tendons** come into the extensor hood from below beyond that joint, and tugs on the hoood causing flexion in the joitns 
	8. this will enhance extension in the interphalangeal joints
	9. lumbrical muscles attach to mid proximal phalanx 
	10. interosseus muscles attach to lateral band 
	11. very easy to see all this stuff! 
	
	hyperflexion of DIP would pull the lateral tendons that came together and extended to the distal phalanx, so it would take part of the bone from it - an avulsion injury 
	- causing the distal phalanx to remain flexed bc flexor digitorium profundis is unopposed now!!! 
	- **two lateral bands of extensor expansion avulse fragment of base of distal phalanx**
	boutonniere / button hole deformity 
	- the central band of extensor expansion detached/severed
	- 2 lateral bands migrate anteriorly on sides of finger 
	- anterior to axis o
5. extensor digiti minimi 
	1. muscles extend fingers 
	2. just next to extensor digitorum 
	3. from the lateral epicondyle/common tendon, 
	4. joints the extnensor expansion for little finger 
	5. extends metacarpopalangeal joint of the little finger
	6. **this is the reason why we can extend just the pinky finger without moving any of the other fingers!**
	7. deep br of radial nerve 
6. extensor carpi ulnaris 
	1. extends hand at wrist  
	2. from lateral epicondyle and posterior shaft of ulna to insert into posterior base of 5th metacarpal bone... 
	3. action to extend + adduct hand at wrist 
	4. deep branch of radial n 
7. anconeus 
	1. different functions, crossing elbow joint but not wrist 
	2. from the posterior aspect of lateral epicondyle to insert into the lateral surface of olecranon process of ulna ... looks like the triangle/sail 
	3. helps triceps in extension of elbow joint!!!
	4. innervated directly from radial n C7-8 and T1 
	5. looks like part of the triceps but isn't. 

deep layer - radial to ulnar 
1. supinator
	1. different functions, crossing elbow joint but not wrist joint = oddball 
2. abductor pollicis longus 
	1. extend or abduct thumb 
3. extensor pollicis brevis 
	1. extend or abduct thumb 
4. extensor pollicis longus 
	1. extend or abduct thumb 
5. extensor indicis 
	1. muscles extend fingers 

functional classification of posterior compartment muscles ^^
1. wrist drop if extends hand at wrist is not working! 
2. digiti muscles extend fingers 
3. pollicis muscles extend or abduct thumb 
4. different functions, crossing elbow joint but not wrist joint
