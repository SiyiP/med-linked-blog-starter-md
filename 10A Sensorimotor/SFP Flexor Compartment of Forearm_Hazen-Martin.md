![[09. Flexor Compartment of Forearm_Hazen-Matin_NOTES (1).pdf]]

from elbow to write = the forearm 
flexor = anterior (of hand/wrist and digits)
posterior = extensor. (of hand/wrist and digits)
much dexterity needs to be between the two, and they will synergize to make it work 
if you make ur hand flat, with thumb on plane too, we see msucle called an adductor inner osseous muscle, thumb is adducted when on the same plane as the flat palm. 
- abduction when the thumb is put out of that plane. 
- opposition - unique to thumbs of humans moving thumb to meet the other fingers. 

forearm skeleton 
- radius - head that spins at the capitulum of the humerus, smaller, descents to broader distal component
	- mostly articulate with carpal bones to make wrist joint 
- ulna articulates with the trochlea of humerus above, descends, getting smaller and articulates **indirectly via a disk, which is why you see a space.**
the 2 bones radius and ulna articulate with one another, allowing for **suppination and pronation**: this is a spinning of the radius on the capitulum, when it spins, it moves the distal end, hand along for the ride. 

carpal bones - are involved in the wrist joint
- there's 2 rows
- 8 altogether
- they articulate proximal one to the wrist jiont 
- the distal one articulates with the metacarpal bones of the digits 
- number the metacarpals starting with the lateral thumb!!! 1-5, thumb always lateral and the most lateral structure. 
	- has 2 phalanges - proximal and distal!!!
	- so thumb only has one interphalangeal joint
	- eveyr othter digit has proximal, middle , and distal, so 2 interphalangeal joints. DIP and PIP.... and MCP 
	- proximal phalanx articulating with head of the metacarpal =  metacarpal phalangeal joint - 
	- carpal bone with metacarpal = carpal metacarpal joint 
	- metacarpal phalangeal joints = the knuckles 
fascia of forearm 
- antebrachial fascia - relatively thick deep fascia cover of forearm 
	- attached to subq border of ulna 
- superficial fascia
	- cephalic V- begins at the dorsal venous arch all the way up the forarm, then going to the anterior side, then going up the arm into the delta pectoral triangle, **draining into the axillary vein**
	- basilic v  - comes from medial side of arch, moving to anterior side, going up by the cutibtal fossa, remaining medial to biceps, dives to make the axillary vein by joinging the brachial veins
		- in the cubicle fossa, the connector median cubicle vein is where we draw blood 
		- bicep aponeurosis will blend over the fascia , keeps the needle from going deeper into the artery which you don't wanna do! 
	- lateral, medial, post antebrachial cutaneous NN 
		- lateral is affiliate with cephalic v from musculocutaneous 
		 - superficial branch of radial branch emerges distally over the beginning of cephalic vein (in HAND) 
		- medial antebrachial, with the basilic vein 
		- posteriorly - there is a nerve that will be from the radial nerve of the arm, sensing to a small strip on the posterior forearm 

forearm compartments - ant and posterior 
separated by radius, ulna, **interosseus membrane** and intermuscular septa 
- the deep fascia extensions of the radius and ulna will merge into those membrane casing of **brachial fascia, further dividing anterior**
- lateral compartment clustered due to supply, spacially discrete but still part of lateral ones 
- fascia on the outside = very very strong, basically when a part is injured, blood will fill just the inside, making pressure c**ompartment syndrome**
	- soft tissue injury -> edema
	- antebrahial fascia 
	- compression of vessels + nerves
	- pain
	- paresthesia,  - numbness/altered sensory 
	- pressure- measureable 
	- pallor/poikilothermia - paleness + loss of temp 
	- paresis = paralysis of that nerve 
	- pulse loss = bc bloods not moving 
	- basically irreversible dmg after 4+ hrs 
happens in forearm and also below the knee

8 anterior muscles in 3 layers - really all layers originate from medial side
most superficial layer 
- 4 muscles from the medial side of the humerus at epicondyle and supracondular ridge
- have to cut the bicipital aponeurosis to see the origins 
1. pronator teres - from the supracondylar ridge and medial epicondyle 
	1. one superficial head = origin medial epicondyle+supracondylar ridge of humerus 
	2. deep head = from medial side of coronoid process of ulna
	3. insertion: into lateral surface of radius -> will cause protonation !!! spinning of radius with that ulna. 
	 nerve supply: median nerve: **between 2 heads of muscle**  - can get pinched
	- these must be reflected in lab - bisect this to trace that median n and branches of brachial a 
	- aftr reflecting you'll be in that cubital fossa region! 
2. flexor carpi radialis FCR - going beyond that wrist joint, will have that action at wrist, insertion on that radial side
	1. origin - common tendon at medial epicondyle and inserts at bases 2nd and 3rd Metacarpals 
	2. causes flexion and abduction of hand at wrist (bc attached to the other side too)
	3. supplied by median nerve + radial artery is lateral of the tendon at the point of insertion at the wrist, so the radial pulse is felt here 
3. palmaris longus - 15% of ppl don't have one; don't rlly need it 
	1. slender
	2. originates from common tendon at medial epicondyle
	3. inserts into palmar aponeurosis 
	4. strengthens grip by being there, flexes hand at wrist + anchors skin of palm 
	5. median nerve supply ; will protect this at the wrist joint, and good for a donor tendon surg 
	6. when dissecting: trace palmaris longus tendon; the aponeurosis when at hand spreads to finger regions - reflex tthis with the palmar aponeurosis 
		1. note that the reflection of this will be done distal to proximal, still attached to the tendon!!! separate from fingers and work back 
		2. underneath the aponeurosis of palmar: 
			1. superficial palmar arterial arch 
			2. palmar digital branches of median n 
			3. reflection also reveals flexor retinaculum
4. flexor carpi ulnaris - 
	1. one head from medial epicondyle 
	2. 2nd head from olecranon and posterior border of ulna 
	3. insertion: into pisiform bone (proximal bone of wrist) and base of the 5th metacarpal 
	4. actions: flex + adducts hand at wrist , bc it inserts at medial side 
	5. nerve: ulnar nerve!!!!! passes between 2 heads at posterior elbow 

intermediate layer
- single muscle - flexor digitorum superficialis, leads to tendons of finger, huge, 
	- has a big belly 
	- arises from the medial epicondyle, area of ulna, and even the shaft/oblique line of the radius, there's an arch of the tendons from which it originates
	- each of the 4 tendons it has distally goes into the digits
		- insert in **middle** phalanx at the 4 fingers, not the thumb
			- we see a split!!!!
			- these splits will be holding those flexor digitorum profundum tendons in place 
		- will cross thru the carpal tunnel, flexing at wrist and the proximal interphalangial joint
			- MCP and PIP joints flexing
	- median nerve supply , runs deep to this 
	- but note; but median n and ulnar a pass deep to fibrous arch between the origins of FDS 

deep layer 
- flexor digitorum profundus 
	- proximal 2/3 ulna and intersseus membrane origin 
	- gives rise to 4 tendons thru the carpal tunnel, only one going to the **distal** phalanges of fingers
		- **these run between the split of the flexor digitorum superficialis**
	- so it flexes DIP but also MCP joints+wrists 
	- nerve supply: median N's **anterior interosseous n branch to lateral half** (will supply everyting in that deep compartment)
	- ulnar n to median half 
- flexor pollicis longus FPL 
	- from middle 1/2 radius and interosseus membrane
	- inserts as a single tendon thru carpal tunnel + inserts on the distal phalanx of THUMB! 
		- flexes the IP joing and MCP of thumb 
		- nerve supply as median's anterior interosseous nerve branch 
		- this tendon will accompany the flexor tendons of finger in carpal tunnel duh 
- protonator quadratus
	- little square muscle 
	- origin: anterior surface of distal ulna 
	- anterior surface of distal radius insertion 
	- assists in pronation ,
	- nerve supply median n/anterior interosseous n 

the carpal tunnel 
- carpal bones makes a concave room 
- on the palmar surface: roof formed by the flexor retinaculum CT that bridges the most medial to lateral side bones 
- tendons of superficialis, radialis, and profundus and the flexor pollicis all go thru here 
- alog with the median nerve, ^^all these are very vulnerable to carpal tunnel syndrome
- we get edema, cramping and many neuro deficits from that
- superficialis tendons arranged , in 2 rows of 2 
	- to the middle nad ring = more anterior
	- the other fingers. = more posterior 
- profundis msucle and the radialis are more flat tendons 
- all these are covered in synovial sheath to glide 

when ppl have carpal tunnel syndrome
- we see pressure on median n , which can be released by butting the flexor retinaculum 
- let it mend don't sew back, splint, and make them move their fingers to avoid scar tissue
- transverse carpal ligament 

fibrous flexor sheaths - 
- encloses anterior surface + sides of long flexor tendons + synovial sheaths  
- prevent tendons from pulling away in flexion 
- osseofibrous tunnel
	- fibrous flexor is anterior + on sides
	- bones of phalanges posterior 
- radial bursa - the synovial sheet around the pollicis longus
- ulnar bursa surrounds 8 tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor digitorium superficialis 
	- ulnar bursa communications with the digitla synovial sheath of **little finger, extension**
- EACH digital synovial sheath will surround both the  flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor digitorium superficialis
- we have connection between ulnar and radial bursa, so we can have infection spread making the horseshoe absess 
	- tenosynovitis = infection in synovial sheaths 

any tendon that will arch over the phalanges has a synovial sheath 
- to hold tendon between the bone, for effective flexion
- but these can get infected and then cause issues and cysts 

"trigger finger"
- have to forciblely push that finger to resist the cyst, 
- this pops the cyst with a click, 
- distal movement of flexor tendon temporarily stopped during extension 
- can work in the other way 
- can be painful ): 


radial / ulnar arteries
- radial a = superficial but deep to brachioradialis 
- origin in the cubital fossa - lateral to medial 
	- biceps tendon
	- brachial a 
	- median n 
- when the brachial a goes below the tendon, divides to radial + ulnar 
	- radial - superficial with the superficial branch of the radial n to the wrist and then move to posterior side
	- ulnar a descends deep to pronator teres, emerge between tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus
		- not in carpal tunnel, **crosses wrist just lateral to the pisiform bone**
		- deep branches - rmove all pronator teres and the flexor superficialis musc 
			- common interosseus A 
				- divides into posterior interosseus A, goes to posterior compartment and over top of interosseus membrane  
				- and anterior interosseus A - descends in that deep compartment as median nerve comes down
					- AI is Okay - if you can flex the thumb! 
					- only nerve that can supply the - flexor pollicis longus FPL , also supplies the radial 1/2 of the digitorum profundus and the protonator quadratus 
				- median n will make the anterior interosseus nerve, running with that anterior interosseus artery , supplying all nerves but the medial half of the flexor digitorum profundis (ulnar nerve supplies instead)

median nerve - big and thick, between 2 heads of pronator teres M 
- no branches until in the forearm 
- supply all muscles in forearm except flexor carpi ulnaris and 1/2 of  flexor digitorum profundis 
ulnar n 
- posterior to medial epicondyle and deep to the flexor carpi ulnaris 
	- dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve branche in forearm 
- only supplies in the forearm to flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar 1/2 of flexor digitorum profundis 

cubital tunnel syndrome
- adjacent to cubital fossal
- basically ulnar n compressed as it enters forearm
 between humera and ulnar heads of flexor carpi ulnaris 
 - cell phone syndrome - long-term flexion at elbow + paresthesia in ulnar side of hands
 - if you surgically move ulnar nerve anterior to medial epicondyle it'll help = stronger arm afterwards, good outcomes 

structures of writst 
- many injuries have happened here!!! 
- common dmg site for trauma 
- many tendons are ulnerable there
- feel the ulnar and radial pulse too , (flexor carpi radialis, just lateral to that)
- on the carpi ulnaris tendon , feel the pisiform bone on the ball of your hand
	- ulnar pulse j lateral to this 
- just lateral to that - where the ulnar a is , along with the ulnar n 
- palmaris longus tendon will overlap the median nerve

median n + palmaris longus tendon - 
- the palmar cutaneous br of median n don't go thru the carpal tunnel 
	- sensation to proximal palm skin. 
- palmaris longus tendon, protects the median nerve at the wrist
