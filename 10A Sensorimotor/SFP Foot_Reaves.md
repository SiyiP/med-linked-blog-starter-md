loaded with info - dissections help 
on plantar surface - very similar 
dorsum - not a whole lot comparitively 

feet attached at ankle as tibiotalar joint
- supporting entire body weight in upright 

3 groups of bone foot
- 7 tarsal:
	- talus
	- calcaneus
	- navicular
	- 3 cuneiforms
		- medial
		- intermed
		- lat
	- cuboid 
- 5 metatarsals
- 14 phalanges
	- great toe has 2 
- 2 sesamoid bones 
areas = hind foot, mid foot, and forefoot - all regions

tibiotalar joint in ankle
transverse tarsal joints = 
- calcaneus and cuboid
- talus-calcaneus + navicular 
subtalar joint 
- talus + calcaneus 

support of arches
- plantar alcaneonavicular , plantar calcaneocuboid / short plantar ligament, long plantar ligaments, plantar aponeurosis (really superficial)
- tendons tibialis ant + post, fibularis longus

ligaments at ankle
- medial / deltoid ligament: from tibia to bones of foot
	- tibiocalcaneal
	- **tibionavicular**
	- ant tibioltalar 
	- posterior tibioltalar 
- lateral ligaments = bone of foot to the fibula
	- ant talofibular 
	- post talofibular 
	- calcaneofibular 

ligaments at intertarsal joints - names tell u where that is 
- subtalar joint : 
	- lateral, medial, posterior, interosseus talocalcaneal ligaments
- talocalcaneoonavicular joints;
	- talonavicular ligament
	- bifurcate ligament
	- plantar calcaneonavicular ligament = spring ligament
- calcaneocuboid joint 
	- bifurcate ligament
	- plantar calcaneocuboid ligament aka short plantar ligament 
- long plantar ligament 
the prosection show this


midfoot ligament s- really hard to identify 
- we need to know the bifurcate ligament 
	- calcaneonavicular ligament 
	- calcaneocuboid ligament 
- for the rest, understand - these are to hold the bones together and to facilitate walking movement 

plantar aponeurosis - similar to palmar, very hard and tough,
- attach to calcaneal tuberosity at the heel end
- digital bands into toes, attaching to bones, ligaments, dermis 
- transverse metatarsal ligaments at the MTP joints 
- superficial transverse metatarsal ligaments attach, 
- both of these will support longitudinal arches. 

extrinsic muscles
- tendons on dorsal aspect
	- extensor hallucis longus
	- extensor digitorum longus 
- on palmar insertion
	- flexor hallucis longis
	- tibialis anterior 
	- flexor digitorum longus 
	- tibialis posterior 
	- fibularis longus 
	- fibularis brevis
![[tendons on dorsal foot.png]]

intrinsic foot on dorsum
- extensor digitorum brevis:
	- from superolateral surface of calcaneus
	- 4 tendons to 
		- great toe at proximal phalanx
		- **3 medial toes**, joining extensor digitorum longus tendons at **extensor hoods** - facilitate the similar movements 
intrinsic plantar muscles - 4 layers
layer 1 - all from calcaneal tuberosity - abduction 
1. abductor hallucis 
	1. attach to medial side of base of prox phalanx of great toe to abduct + flex at MTP joint 
2. flexor digitorum brevis 
	1. insert into middle phalanges of **lateral 4 toes**
	2. flex at PIP joints 
3. abductor digiti minimi 
	1. insert to lat side of base of prox phalanx of little toe 
	2. abduct at mtp joint 

layer 2 - a lotta flexion 
1. quadratus plantae 
	1. from calcaneus
	2. to lateral side of flexor digitorum longus tendon 
	3. assists that muscle to flex those lateral toes 
2. 4 lumbricals
	1. 1st lumbrical - from mdial side of  flexor digitorum longus tendon , toe 2
	2. 2-4 = from the other FDL tendonos 
	3. to medial side of extensor hoods 
	4. to flex mtp while extending IP 

layer 3 
1. flexor hallucis brevis- has 2 heads - from cuboid +lateral cuneiform, and tibialis posterior tendon. flexor hallucis longus tendon will split that flexor hallucis brevis
	1. flexes mtp joint, goes to base of prox phalanx of great toe 
2. adductor hallucis - has oblique + transverse head 
	1. transverse heads from ligaments at mtp joints of lateral 3 toes
	2. oblique head from bases of 2nd-4th MT joints , from fibularis longus tendon SHEATH 
	3. recall that  fibularis longus tendon  travels all the way to that calcaneus and stuff, so oblique is from that 
3. flexor digiti minimi brevis
	1. from the base of the 5th mt and fibularis longus tendon sheath
	2. insert to lateral side of base of prox phalanx of little toe 
	3. flex mtp joint 
layer 4 - deeper 
4. dorsal interossei - has 2 heads on each 
	1. from sides of adjacent metatarsals to extensor hoods of **toes 2-4 **
	2. abduct mtp and resist extension mtp, flexion the ip 
	3. 4 dorsl interossei 
	4. 2nd toe can move either way 
5. plantar interossei - has only 1 head 
	1. from medial sides of mts 3-5
	2. to extensor hoods 3-5 
	3. adduct 3-5 mtp joints, rsisting extension mtp for flexion ip \deepest muscles
	4. there's like 3 smaller plantar interossei
	5. these are unipennate, from single metatarsal bone 
	6. involved in adduction 

platar arterial supply 
- medial plantar artery - from the terminal br of posterior tibial a - will be along the medial side of sole to medial side of gr8 toe
	- bt the abductor hallucis + flexor digitorum brevis
- lateral plantar artery 
	- deep to abductor hallucis bt flexor digitorum brevis + quadratus plantae metatarsal 5, arches medially + deep platnar arch on base of metatarsals
	- bt metatarsals 1-2  , joins terminal br of dorsalis pedis artery on the side 
- deep plantar arch 
	- digital br to small toe with 4 plantar metatarsal aa
		- all have plantar digital br 
	- 3 perforating artereies anastamose with dorsal aa 
proper plantar digital arteries + common plantar digital arteries are here too 

on the dorsal side
- dorsalis pedis artery - 
	- continuation of anterior tibial a , changes the name at the ankle joint 
	- this is bt tendons of extensor hallucis longus + extensor digitorum longus 
	- deep plantar a passes here to contribute to deep  plantar arch 
- we have an arcuate artery - at base of metatarsals
	- dorsal metatarsal aa
	- dorsal digital aa 
	- 1st dorsal metatarsal a
- dorsal digital arteries and dorsal metatarsalaa will pass thru to the plantar side bt 2 heads of the 1st dorsal interosseus 
	- joining the deep plantar arch 

veins of the foot - less important - find the great and lesser saphenous, which will come together to make the dorsal venous arch... which drains the superficial veins
- deep veins accompany the aa... plantar metatarsal v drain to dee p plantar veins at arterial arch 
- drain to lateral platnar vein to posterior tibial vein 
- great saphenous v on medial side = pass ant to medial malleolus 
- small saphenous v on lateral side = pass poterior to lateral malleolus 

n supply from tibial nerve
- travels to the plantar portion of foot, giving rise to medial and lateral plantar nerve 
- enters foot posterior to medial malleolus. - medial calcaneal nerves
- medial plantar nerve
	- large sensory area - supplies medial anterior 2/3 of sole 
	- medial 3 and a half toes 
	- saphenous nerve = on medial side of foot
	- sural nerve = on lateral side of foot 
	- tibial nerve = on the calcaneal or heel


4 plantar intrinsic muscles of the medial plantar nerve
- abductor hallucis
- flexor digitorum brevis
- flexor hallucis brevis
- 1st lumbrical 

n supply - lateral plantar nerve from tibial nerve 
the lateral plantar nerve on the lateral 1 and a half toes 
- accompanie lat plantar artery 
- lateral ant 1/3 of sole + lateral 1 and a half toes
- will supply all the rest of the muscles  not supplied by the medial plantar
	- outlier, supplis also the 3 lumbricals laterally 

deep br that dives in and then a superficial br that stays on the surface
- there's common plantar nerves
- and proper plantar digital br of plantar nerve when it splits
	- there's versions for the lateral platnar nerve
	- or medial platnar nerves, depending on which toes 

nerve on dorsum of foot
- recall - saphenous nerve will travel into the medial side, so down the superior and medial part of dorsal foot
- superficial fibular nerve
	- from common fibular v , and superficial becomes cutaneous to dorsum of foot 
	- no muscle supply in foot, sensory to majority of dorsum of foot + toes except
		- no medial ankle / just inf 
		- lateral side of foot
		- lat side of little toe
		- webspace bt great toe + 2nd toe 
- deep fibular nerve
	- extensor digitorum brevis (medial 2 dorsal interossei)
	- snesory to the webspace bt great and 2nd toe 
	- basically toe tips
- and sural nerve to lateral sliver of foot 

movements
- inversion - tibialis ant/post, extensor hallucis longus 
- eversion - fibularis longus + brevis, fibularis tertius 
- plantar flexion - tibialis post, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, soleus, plantaris, gastrocnemius 
- dorsiflexion / extension - extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior 

movements of abduction /adduction 
- these have the 2nd toe as the line !!!
- abduction move thumb and toes apart
	- dorsal interossei
	- abductor digiti minimi
	- abductor hallucis
	- flexor digitorum brevis 
- adduction move them together = 
	- adductor hallucis 
	- plantar interossei (with aid from lumbricals)

clinical info
1. pes planus- the flattened foot arch 
	1. the talus dislocates , so makes the foot flatten and hurt
	2. rest + ice to reliev pain and reduce swelling 
	3. overuse injury 
2. plantar fascitis - plantar fascia across bottom of foot and connects heel bone/calcaneus will get inflammed and hurt
	1. pain is due to **inferior calcaneal nerve**
	2. most recovery with rest + ice + NSAIDs
3. stress fractures
	1.  from running and strike or land improperly it'll swell up. 
	2. stress fracture heal with rest and sometimes use boot 
4. achilles tendinitis - when this attached to calcaneus is inflammed, causes mild ache... caused by tight calves 
	1. treat with ice + rest 
5. turf toe - 
	1. sprain of great toe joint from football, results from **excessive upward bending** or jamming; 
	2. RICE treatment
6. heel spur - calcium depo that makes a bony protrusion along plantar fascia
	1. need stretches to the plantar area, dec the associated inflammation 
	2. application of ice
7. morton's neuroma / intermetatarsal neuroma
	1. compression of nerve or irritation - typically bt 3rd and 4th toes
	2. this is in the plantar areas of foot bc of heel strikes
	3. shoes that contrict the feet too much 
	4. treat with activity mods, shoe mods , and NSAIDs/injections 
8. lisfranc/midfoot injury 
	1. happens in football players - where the ***bifurcate*** ligaments get torn, so the CTs will stretch, twisting fall usually + bones are dislocated
