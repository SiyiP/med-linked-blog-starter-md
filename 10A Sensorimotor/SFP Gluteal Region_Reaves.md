#sensorimotor 

recall -level of iliac crest L4 ish 
must locate the posterior superior iliac spine = about S1-2
- tip of greater trochanter = slightly lower things that jut out to the sides 
- ischial tuberosity = what we're sitting on 

msucles we start out naming: they are medial rotators !!
gluteal = between iliac crest + gluteal fold of buttock 
notably the lower limbs are mainly for stability + weight bearing 
pelvic girdle = lnik bt lower limbs and the axial skeleton 
- right and left hip / coxal bones with acetabulum 
- sacrum + coccyx 
- femur too is part of it 

hip bone = the ilium 
- acetabulum = the middle divot on the lateral side of the ilium... made up of 3 parts
	- ilium (has iliac tubercle where ligaments attach to, gluteal lines = attachments for muscles, ASIS and AIIS , PSIS and PIIS , with **greater sciatic notch**) ... medially the ilium has the iliac tuberosity and the auricular surface for sacrum + ala (wing portion of ilium)
	- ischium = what we're sitting on. we have an ischial spine, lesser sciatic notch, and ischial tuberosities.... the body on the inside of the lateral side. medial surfaces don't have much except maybe concavity
	- pubis = has body, superior ramus, inferior ramus attaching point, and obturator foramen will have a small artery come thru there to supply the femur 

femur - strongest and longest
- posteriorly has a head with the fovea capitis , has an artery attach to it 
	- intertrochanteric crest going down, in between the greater and lesser trochanters for muscles 
	- gluteal tuberosity - where gluteus maximus would attach to 
- anteriorly has a head + neck, intertrochanteric LINE (not crest), and a shaft 

sacroiliac joint = strong synovial joints bt auricular surfaces of iliac and sacrum 
- very strong and don't come apart except maybe with trauma
- strong posterior + interosseus sacroiliac ligaments
- thin anterior sacroiliac ligament on anterior aspect of joint 
- give rise to 2 important accessory ligaments
	- sacrotuberous ligament = from sacrum to ischial tuberosity 
	- sacrospinous = from sacrum to ischial spine 

note - greater and lesser sciatic notches BECOME the 
greater + lesser sciatic foramina via ligaments filling it up 
- greater sciatic foramen = 
	- anterosuperior = rim of the great sciatic notch 
	- posteromedial = sacrotuberous ligament
	- inferiorly = sacrospinous ligament + ischial spine 
		- passing thru: superior + inf gluteal aa
		- superior + inf gluteal nn 
		- n to quadratus femoris m (hard to id)
- lesser sciatic foramen
	- anterior: body of ischium tuberosity + rim of lesser sciatic notch 
	- superiorly = ischial spine and sacrospinous ligament
	- posteriorly = sacrotuberous ligament 
		- passing thru 
passing thru both (out the greater into the lesser)
- pudendal n 
- internal pudendal artery (there's a vein we cut out)
- n to obturator internus muscle 
PIN structures!!! from medial to lateral 


gluteus maximus = in most superficial position 
- entire reason we walk upright 
- from outer surface of ilium, postrior surface of sacrom+coccyx + sacrotuberous ligament origin!!!
- inserts onto the iliotibial tract + gluteal tuberosity of femur!!!
- innervation = **inferior** gluteal nerve 
	- extends and laterally rotates hip joint (entire lower limb)
	- extends trunk at hip when lower extremity is fixed (helps straighten core when you're fixed)
	- can contribute to knee joint extension **(note that the iliotibial tract runs below the knee)**

deep to maximus, gluteus medius 
- remove the fascia 
- thick-fan-shaped muscle almost entirely coveerd by the maximus 
- originates from outer surface of ilium, bt posterior and anterior gluteal lines 
- innervation by superior gluteal nerve 
- will insert into the **lateral upper surface of greater trochanter** 
	- note how it's high and lateral
- this means that it would do abduction of thigh at hip joint, and medially rotates the thigh (medial rotation bc it's the anterior lateral surface insertion, it pulls up when contracting)
- prevents down tilt of pelvis on the opposite side when foot's anchored. 
	- when it contracts on one side, it holds up the opposite side, like making one hip area more compact = raising the other one. working in oopposite direction

gluteus minimus
- thin, fanshaped muscle which is underneath gluteus medius 
- origin on the outer surface of ilium, bt anterior + inferior gluteal lines
- inserts onto anterior + upper surface of greater trochanter 
- innervation superior gluteal nerve 
- will abduct thigh at hip jjoint
- prevents down tilt of pelvis on the opposite side when foot's anchored. 
- ofc the anterior fibers will contribute to medial rotation of thigh at hip 

positive trendelenburg's sign 
- decr strength oof gluteus medius + minimus due to trauma/dz on one side = "dropped pelvis" [[SFP Bone Pathology I+II Forucci and Ritchie]]

tensor fasciae latae - TFL
- if you run a lot this is implicated ; smaller muscle, and in some cadavers some are covered by fascia of long tendon 
- originates from outermost edge of iliac crest, going from the anterior superior iliac spine to the iliac tubercle... 
- inserts onto anterior aspect of iliotibial tract ... near the front 
- innervation by the superior gluteal nerve 
- thigh abductor... medial rotation bc insertion near front, and contributes to knee extension 
	- think gluteus maximus will also help with knee extension bc of connection via **iliotibial tract**

iliotibial tract in gneeral
- such a long tendon, huge thing that will be for runners. really for running in short distances to get away - this is why we end up with this inury 
- structure depends on the muscles attached to it 
	- strengthened superiorly and posteriorly by gluteus maximus fibers
	- extends the iliac tubercle to latral tibial condyle - attach to septums of thigh muscles  
	- each time you have a long tendon and muscles which pass over 2 joints... there's issues with stability bc of the 2 joints all doing different things - keep this in mind. 
- movement = **extension, abductor + medial rotator of hip, laterally stabilizes the knee joint**
- this is a sheath around the tensor fascia lata muscle! 
- tensor fascia lata = flexor, abductor + internal rotator of hip + tenses fascia lata 
	- from the iliac crest... descends infriorly to superoolateral thigh and inserts into anterior iliotibial tract
- also contracts ; when u contrat and suport the knee, it can extend and support it esp when opposite foot's lifted 
- msucles in anterior + posterior thigh compartments are closer to the femur
- within the compartment, there's a centralization of muscle weight + limit of outward expansion , which in turn reduces overall force req for movement at hip joint
- stiffness in the knees and legs with age = probably bc of this iliotibial tract band.


deep muscles
with the reflection of gluteus maximus 
from top to bottom (under gluteus medius) 
- piriformis  = the landmark of deep gluteal region 
	- from antero-lateral border of sacrum, thru the greater sciatic foramen 
	- insertion onto the upper medial aspect of greater trochanter
	- basically this will mean you pull the trochanter inwards, making the thigh laterally rotate 
	- innervation = anterior rami of 1st/2nd S1-2 sacral spinal nerves 
- superior gemellus
- obturator internus
- inferior femellus 
- quadratus femoris 
short **lateral** rotators of hip joint , counteract medial rotators abov 
1. superior gemellus  - infrior to pirifrmis
	1. from origin spine of ischium (seen poosteriorly) and 
	2. insertion with the tendon of obturator intrenus into medial aspect of upper trochanter
	3. lateral rotator 
	4. nerve of obturator internus 
2. inferior gemellus
	1. below obturator internus 
	2. from upper margin of ischial tuberosity 
	3. inserts with tendon of obturator internus into medial aspect of greater trochanter 
	4. innervated by n of **the quadratus femoris**
	5. lat rotator of thigh 
3. obturator internus
	1. fan shaped, inferior to superior gemellus
	2. from origin pelvic surface of obturator membrane 
	3. insertion into medial aspect of upper trochanter with both gemelli 
	4. n of obtruator internus 
	5. lateral rotator of thigh at hip 
	6. **prominent tendon is in the center of this**
4. quadratus femoris 
	1. pretty prominent, between greater and lessr trochanters
	2. originate from lateral border of ischial tuberosity
	3. inserts onto quadrate tubercle on intertrochanteric crest of the femur 
	4. innervation nerve of quadratus femoris 
	5. lat rotation 

source of these nerves
- sacral plexus is L4-5, S1-4 
- sup gluetal n = L4,5,S1
- sciatic n L4-5, S1-3
- inf gluteal n L5; S1,2
- N to obtruator internus L5, S1
- - N to quadratus femoris L5, S1
- posterior femoral cutaneous n s1-3
- pudendal n = s2-4 

source of arteries
- from abdominal aorta
- common iliac -> internal iliac 
	- posterior division/trunk -> superior gluteal = 
	- anterior trunk -> inf gluteal 
	- anterior trunk -> internal pudendal 
- br exit thru greater sciatic foramen, on either side of piriformis. - landmark bc these structures pass above and below it 

structures exiting greater sciatic foramen above piriformis
- superior gluteal n (to gluteus medius, minimis, TFL)
- superior gluteal vessels wihch supply tissues of gluteal origin 
exiting below
- sciatic n 
- **inferior glutael nerve which innervates gluteus max**
-  N to obtruator internus supplying the superior gemellus 
- - N to quadratus femoris supplying inf gemellus 
- posterior femoral cutaneous n 
- pudendal n 
- internal pudendal vessels 
they are deep to the sacrotubulous ligament

only structure exiting lesser sciatic foramen 
- obturator internus muscle 
structure **entering perineum** 
- thru lesser sciatic foramen - after exiting pelvis thru greater sciatic foramen below the piriformis:
	- pudendal n - most medial 
	- internal pudendal vessels - 
	- n to obturator internus - most lateral 
	- PIN ^^

sciatic n = exit greater sciatic foramen, mid distance bt PSIS and ischial tuberosity 
- midways bt ischial tuberosity + greater trochanter too 
	- clinical implications = when giving shots'
		- this nerve is in lower medial quadrant of gluteal region 
		- IM injection should be put into the upper lateral quadrant to avoid this nerve
	- but sometimes this nerve divides early into 
		- tibial
		- common fibular nerves
		- if it's too above the piriformis or going thru it it can cause issues
			- common fibular nerves get compress when it contracts, so might have some issues with it tingling etc

cutaneous nn of gluteal - 4 quadrants
1. upper medial = superior + middle cluneal nn (ez to id),
2. upper lateral = lateral cutaneous br of iliohypogastric + ventral ramus of t12_
3. lower lateral/**femoral** = lat cutaneus nn of thigh , ventral rami L2-3
4. lower medial = posterior cutaneous nn of thigh = inferior cluneal nn, ventral rami s1-3 

cruciate anastomosis
- on posterior aspect of thigh 
- provides connection bt internal iliac and femoral aa 
	- inf gluteal a
	- lateral circumflex femoral a (transverse br)
	- medial circumflex femoral a (transverse br)
	- first perforating a (br of profunda a)

piriformis syndrome
- pain in butt
- basically in 15-20% of the population , the sciatic nerve will cross below but the muscle splits, either comes out under or on top 
	- inc tension or irritation
	- tickle that nerve = issues with foot/legs
- crosss over 2 joints. sacroiliac + hip 
	- can strengthen the piriformis, 
	- if you make that piriformis to get it thicker, you eliminte that split and looseness
- pain down the posterior leg 
- treat: foot orthotic, biomech issue, examine sacroiliac joint/hip joint, typially mssage , ice

sacroliliac joint dysfunction 
- excessive movement in the joint, maybe trauma caused. 
- bc ligament has been stretched
- can lead to piriformis syndrome, degen arthritis 
- pregnancy can cause this bc they get so much excess weight in short time. 
- also this is larger but goes into effect when baby's born 
- symptoms - pain in lower back, back of hips + lessor exent groin+thigh
- treatments = anti infalmmatory meds + physical therapy
