- hand = distal to the carpal bones
5 metacarpal bones **1-5 starting with thumb** 
each metacarpal has 
- base - articulates with 1+ carpal bones 
- shaft
- head - articulate distally with phalanx. 
metacarpal bones  
are slightly triangular in cross-section  
and present a palmar concavity in  
their length.

fingers -3 phalanges (prox, mid , distal )
thumb - 2 prox + distal 
- sesamoid bones - free floating bones that would allow for movement facilitation, seen in larger ones. 

Each phalanx has a base, shaft and head.
- the sesamoid bones are on the MCP of thumb and sometimes are at the index mcp 
- like a sesame seed on xray, bone in a tendon/ muscle 

bursa of hand = continuation from wrist/forearm, 
- radial bursa which is tendinous sheth of flexor pollicis longus +
- ulnar bursa which is the common flexor sheath 
- named for the nerves
- phalangeal bursa in between PIP and DIP 
recall: 
- cephalic vein from lateral aspect
- basilic from medial aspect of dorsal venous arch 
- joined by median cubital v 
- these two veins will infiltrate hand , just drain 

dermatomes:
C6 = skin of thumb  / lateral part of forearm 
C7 = skin of index, mid finger + ring fingers, middle part of hand
C8 = skin of little finger , medial hand, distal forearm 

extrensic mulscles on dorsal + palmar surfaces review from forearm 

note muscle gruops
- there's a pamar aponeurosis that is attached to flexor retinaculum, with 4 fibrous slips that extends to each finger. 
- small muscle in the medial side of hand = palmaris brevis 
- some diseases of the fascia
	- dupuytren's disease = collagen overgrowth, inability to extend the hand
	- thenar vs hypothenar(fifth digit) eminences
	- intrinsic v extrensic 

movements
abduction + adduction is with reference to axis passing thru middle finger. 
thumb = movements are in ref to plane of palm of hand. 

thenar eminence- technically extrinsic, origin from carpal bones 
- abductor pollicis brevis - move thumb away from palm - most medial
	- superficial + anterior in thenar eminence
	- origin - flexor retinaculum + carpals
	- insert into lateral aspect of base of proximal phalanx of thumb with the flexor pollicis brevis
	- abduction of the thumb at carpometaarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints 
- flexor pollicis brevis - thumb flexion - middle 
	- 2 heads, superficial + deep head. 
	- originate from lat + anterior surface of flexor retinaculum 
	- insert into lateral aspect of base of proximal phalanx of thumb with the abductor pollicis brevis; sometimes attached to sesamoid bone 
	- flex that metacarpophalangeal joint of thumb 
- opponens pollicis - opposition - most lateral 
	- DEEP to abductor pollicis brevis
	- origin lateral and anterior surface of flexor retinaculum 
	- inserts into entire length of lateral border of shaft of the first metacarpal bone!!!
	- makes sense that it's the most lateral, since we have to reach all the way to the pinky! 

adductor pollicis - 4th short musle of thumb but not in the thenar eminence
- 2 heads (oblique + transverse)
- origin - oblique head from anterior surfaces of base w/ 2nd/3rd metacarpal... transverse head from anterior surface of 3rd metacarpal 
- insertion - medial side of base of prox phalanx of thumb 
- one line to the palm formed by muscle = adduction of carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints 


---
hypothenar eminence - technically extrinsic, origin from carpal bones 
abductor digiti minimi
- superficial + medial in hypotheniar eminence
- origin = pisiform bone
- inserts into medial side of base of proximal phalanx in the little finger, so this is like 
- abduction of metacarpophalangeal joint of the little finger 
	- basically the insertion point into the side/medial side of base in proximal phalanx...
	- when it CONTRACts, it pulls finger to side slightly basically 

flexor digiti minimi
- origin from medial portion of anterior surface of flexor retinaculum  , just deep to the abductor
- insertion into medial side of base of proximal phalanx of little finger 
- flexion of metacarpophalangeal joint of little finger 
-  whole finger goes forth 

opponens digiti minimi 
- from medial portion of ant surface of flexor retinaculum, 
- similar insertion into entire legnth of medial border of 5th metacarpal bone, bringing the little finger into opposition with thumb 

actual intrinsic muscles of the hand 
lumbrical muscles (4)
- from tendons of **flexor digitorum profundus**- 
- insertion onto the LATERAL side of the corresponding extensor expansion hoods 
- first 2 = **one head**
- 3-4 have 2 heads 
- flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints + extend the interphalangeal joints too 
	- expansion hood insertion = basically it would be the most **superficial** muscle that inserts underneath, allowing extension of intrphalangeal joints 
	- flexion of metacapophalangeal joints. 

palmar interossei muscles (3)
- from anterior surface of shaft of 2nd, 4th, 5th metacarbal bones
- insertion **into proximal phalanges, onto the side closest to the middle finger**
	- adduct index, ring, and little finger , since origin point is metacarpal bones. pulling everything in, near the axial line. 
- also insert into extensor expansions of index, ring, little fingers
	- flex metacarpophalangeal joitns 
	- while extending the interphalangeal joints of those 3 fingers
- Think: PAD: Three palmar interosseous muscles ad ADductors
- ADductors = PAD, taking 2,4,5 towards the axial line down middle finger 

dorsal interossei muscles (4)
- 2 heads
- from adjacent sids of metacarpal bones
- insert into proximal phalanges + extensor expansions of index, middle and ring fingers... 
	- 2 muscles dedicated to the middle finger
	this can mean that the middle finger can move in **both directions** but everything else just in one direction
- abduction, pulling apart fingers, 
- also insertion into extensor expansions = this is the most dorsal / posterior 
	- same movements as 	- flex the metacarpophalangeal joints + extend the interphalangeal joints of these 3 fingers 
- 4 dorsal interosseuous muscles are ABductors DAB - move 2,3,4 away from midline 

thenar space. = first lumbrical = lateral posterior to long flexor tendon 
- 3 lumbricals = posterior to long flexor tnedons of mid, ring, little fingers

superficial palmar arch 
- ulnar a = pass superficial to flexor retinaculum, lateral to ulnar n + pisiform 
	- gives deep palmar br , deep to palmar apon. anterior to long flexor tendons -> **making superficial palmar arch**
	- anastomose w/ superficial palmar br from the radial artery 
- 3 common br palmar digital a... divides self into **proper palmar digital a** to each finger... 1 proper one to litte finger

radial a - from anterior aspect of wrist to lat side -> **posterior aspect of hand**
	passes beneath tendons of **abductor pollicis longus+extensor pollicis muscles**
	dives bt 2 heads of first dorsal interosseous musc to pass bt transverse + oblique heads of adductor pollicis muscle
- note = common palmar digital arteries, **until it will bifurcate into proper palmar digital arteries** 
	- happens in the web spaces of the fingers 

deep palmar arch - 
- deep br of ulnar will travel posterior ,,, and will connect with the radial artery anastamoses. 
- arch = deep to **long flexor tendons, anterior to metacarpal bones + itnerosseuous**
- 3 small palmar metacarpal a a**nastamose with matching arteries from superficial arch** 
	- **radialis indicis a** to lateral side of index finger + the **princeps pollicis artery** to both sides of thumb
	- radialis indicis artery will supply to the index finger deeply 
	- princeps pollicis artery = supply to the thumb 

allen's test = to check patency of radial and ulnar aa 
- radial a is largest artery of the hand 
- place finger on the ulnar a and radial arteries, taking these pulses. 

cutaneous innervation 
- median (medial and lateral cord combo)
- ulnar (medial)
- radial (postreior cord)
motor
- ulnar and median ; NO RADIAL!

hand qt nerves
![[hand nerve distrib.png]]

ulnar and median nerves have essentially innervated the palms. both  have palmar br and a common and proper palmar digital br 
- palmar br 
- common palmar digital br
- proper palmar digital brs 
note; small area of anterior aspect of base of **thumb** = lateral band is innervated by the **superficial br of radial nerve**

in terms of dorsla cutaneous nervesrecall that median innervation of the top digits - palmar digital branches that spill over 
- superficial br of radial n = at wrist
- dorsal br of ulnar emerges under flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, on medial aspect of distal forearm and winds aroun the wrist to provide cutaneous innevation to dorsal aspect of 1 1/2 medial fingers 
- superficial br of radial pass **deep to brachioradialis** and supericial to extensor retinaculum 

palmar
- both median + ulnar n 
- **patient presenting wiht carpal tunnel don't get these symptoms of pain/paresthesia in the palm of hand nor in the 1 1/2 medial fingers**
	- this is bc we hav the ulnar nerve 

median nerve - dorsal side tips of fingers
- pass bt flexor digitorum superficialis + flexor carpi radialis, deep to palmaris longus tendon 
- under flexor retinaculum 
- give motor recurent br to 3 muscles f thenar eminence 
- 2 common palmar digital br dividing into proper palmar digital nerves
	- innrvation to 1st and 2nd lumbrical 

ulnar - superficial to flexor retinaclulum, **run distally bt psisiform and the hook of hamate = tunnel of guyon**
- divides in palm into superficial + deep br
- superficial br = motor to small musc, palmaris brevis + cutaneus to medial aspect of medial 1 1/2 fingers
- deep br = to 3 hypothenar muscles, all dorsal + palmar interossei, 2 most medial lumbricals + adductor pollicis 

superficial branch of the radial nerve  
(dorsal digital nerves) innervates the  
dorsal aspect of the lateral 3½  
fingers - these don't extend beyond middle phalanges ... proper palmar digital brs of median nerve innervate distal ends of lateral 3 1/2 fingers

stenosing tenosynovitis - trigger finger syndrome
- or trigger thumb sometimes
- tendongets inflamed and swollen 
- lng term irritation of this sheath = scarring + thickening that impact motion 
- when this happens, bending finger will pull the inflamed tendon thru narrowed sheath, making it snap/pop 

injuries to the ulnar n
- tunnel of guyon - **losing cutaneous innervation to palmar aspect of medial fingers + ability to contract all intrinsic hand muscles** except for 5 muscles innervatd by the median instead 
- flexor + extnsor extrinsics are unopposed, fingers will be clawed hand
- all interossei paralyzed aka MCP in extended with both pip and dip flexed 
- ///only 2 medial lumbricals paralyzed, contribute to this but note - etnsion at mcp and flexion at both pip and dip are less dramatic in index + middle fingers 
	- first 2 lumbricals are working but everyting else is fine. - innervated by median 
- adductor policis brevis = non-functional, with thumb abducted 
	- can't hold piece of paper bc of this

![[12. Joints of the Upper Limb_Reaves_NOTES (1).pdf]]

joint = arthrosis = an area where 2 bones are attachd usually for movemnt
3 typs
- fibrous- sutures in skull, minimal mvement, alveolar process, roots of teeeth, radius and ulna, with movement around this axis instead of away ... these are interlcked with interosseuous membrane 
- cartilaginous  - hyaline cartilage, synchondrosis = name for the joint bt cartilage and bone, like epiphysis and diaphysis of long bones = primary ones
	- secondary = symphesis of vertebrae, which is like between bodies on midlines 
	- determines mobility 
- synovial joints - highly moble, hyaline cartilage covers these surfaces, covered by fibrous capusle and enclosed by synovial membrane
	- plane joint
	- hinge -elbow 
	- pivot - axis and atlas of head 
	- condyloid - saddle type of joint 
	- ellipsoid- movement of hands and toes, will glide 
	- saddle - thumb 
	- ball + socket  - hip and shoulder 

ways of movement
- gliding - without angular or rotation - carpal joints
- angular - only bt long bones , elbows, fingers, toes
- circumduction - head + articular cavity, likes shoulder jjoint - makes a cone 
- rotation - bone moves on central axis without moving, like radius/ulnar - interosseous membrane allows for this 

joint stabiilty - architecture, ligaments(support/ROM), tone of muscles surroundign joint too compensate for articular shapes

hilton's law = a n that supplies a joint supplies muscles that move that joint + the skin over insertions
- help sensory input for pain 
- proprioception from joint capsule + ligaments
- blood supply via artery that passes over/near the joint 
- some exception to the hilton's law . 

3 joints having fibrocartilaginous discs
- sternoclavicular -synovium within same plane 
	- clavicle
	- manubrium of sternum 
	- costal cartilage 
		- lateral compartment = will be opened out to allow for muscle elevation 
			- sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, levator scapulae, rhomboids
			- depression. =pec minor, subclavius 
		- medial compartment = closed out , so anterior and posterior movements only 
			- anterior serratus anterior 
			- posterior - trapezius + rhomboids. 
		- ligaments are sternoclavicular anteriorly and posteriorly portion there and costoclavicularly (from first rib to clavicle)
		- nerves = supraclaviar n + n to subclavius 
	- movement = full limb elevation about 60 degrees bc this joint will go up and down .... as arm is fully extended, abducted clavicle rotate at there 25-30 dgrees
	-  **ankylosis = fixation of joint = we need to remove the center f clavicle to heal, so we get flail joint/excessive movments**
- acromioclavicular
	- lateral clavicle
	- acromion of scapula
	- articular disc, so it's wedge shaped 
	- ligaments = acromioclavicular superiorly and inferiorly . and coracoclavicular in 2 parts: trapezoid z= conoid, just under of that place to limit the clavile movement on the coracoid process
	- acromion rotates at joint as scapula moves (limited by the coracoclavicular ligaments)
	- nerves = supraclavicular, med/lat pectoral + axilary nns 
- distal radioulnar 

glenohumoral joints
- have a glenoid fossa - where humerus fits into 
- supraglenoid tubercle = attachment of long head biceps
- infraglenoid tubercle = long head of triceps attach 
- both hips and shoulders involved in movement, BUT for shoulders it's mobbility first and stability 2nd, 
- glenoid labrum = lip of fossa, circumference 
- synovial membrane / cavity = covers all articulating surfaces, 
	- transverse humeral ligament helps hold long head of bicep in place
	- coracoacromial ligament = holds acromium to coraconoid process similarly to before. 
- anterior support 
	- glenohumeral = has superior, middle and inferior side
	- transverse ligamnt of humerus 
	- 1 subscapularis muscle = with the tendon anteriorly supporting the shulder
superior support
- bony procsses: acromium + coracoid
- supraspinatus + bicep tendon 
- ligaments: coracoacromial + coracohumeral 
tendon of that supraspinatous muscle passes below AC joint and ccross the glenohumeral joint to greater tubercle of humerus 
- posterior support = 
	- infraspinatus + teres minor 
	- no inferior supporting structures....
	- so the dislocated head of humerus can enter quadrilateral space, **compromising axillary n and posterior circumlex humeral vessels**

several shoulder bursae
- subdeltoid
- subacromial
	- bursistis = painful arc syndrome = which is like leading to **painful arc syndrom**e - hard to raise and move shoudler 
	- inflammatory cells like neutrphils will tear up that tissue 
	- our shoudler doesn't heal up bc it's moving = painful arc syndrome
	- eventually you can get inflammatory joint disease + then biceps tendon degeneration 
- subscapular
- subacromial 

elbow joint
- capitulum of humerus w head of radius 
- trochlea of humerus with trochlear notch of ulna 
- synovial membrane covers all
	lines the joint capsule, continuous with prox radio ulnar joint
	note = small amount of sacciform process near the bottom of radius bc annular ligament from radius to ulna will surround portion of it 
anterior elbow support
- no anterior ligament support but there's radial collateral ligament on radial side 
- ulnar collateral ligament some of the fibers too 
- tnedon of biceps and brachialis 
radial collateral ligament = will attach to annular ligament
- **if you injure one you injure both**
ulnar collateral ligament = has anterior, psterior, tranverse band 

relationships
- median , radial, musculocutaneus + ulnar joints all supply this joint
- olecranon bursae = **bt triceps tendon + olecranon + then olecranon + overlying skin**
radioulnar joints -
- radius + ulna articulate prox and distally 
- proximally 
	- head of radius into radial notch of ulna
- distally 
	- head of ulna into ulnar notch of radius
	- we have fibrocartilage = **triangular fibrocartilage to make sure they don't band agains each other to join these**
	- weak ant/posterior ligaments
	- anterior + posterior interosseus nerves (deep br of radial aka) supply 
- both synovial pivot joints due to interosseuos membranes 
- pronation and supination occurs at radioulnar joints 
	- supinator = laterally rotate head f radius 
	- pronators will medially rotate 


wrist / radiocarpal joint - **ulnar does not articulate!**
- distal radius + triangular cartilage will artiulate with scaphoid, lunate + triquetral 
- felxion + extension , abduction, adduction, circumduction/ellipsoid articulation 
- separate synovial cavity associated with this joint 
reinforcing ligaments of the wrist capsule - hard to id in lab
- just know. - there's a lot of named ligaments (reinforcing ones we don't have to know thte name which holds the hand together)
- anterior interosseus n 
- deep br of radial nerve/posterior interosseus n 
- deep br of ulnar n 
- scaphoid fracture = most common injury, break fall with arms, **very common**

intercarpal joints
- synovial plane joints bt individual carpal bones
- very important - this is a shared synovial cavity + joint capsule, if one of these is infectd, all of these are!
- spread quickly 
- - anterior interosseus n  + deep brs of radial/ulnar nerves

carpometacarpal/intermetacarpal joints
- synovial plane joitns all except the saddle joint of thumb
	- bc of that , the thumb is protected from stuff like inflammation of everything else bc shared synovial space/capsule except thumb 
- MP ligaments - palmar, dorsal + collateral holding palmar + dorsal.. also deep tranverse which allows for coordinated movements between digits 
- interphalangeal ligaments - palmar, dorsal, collateral 


sternoclavicular joint injuries
- trauma/accidents, 
- anterior dislocation usually 
- if poterior, more serious bc of the strong ligaments , and organs bakck there. so requires more force for this 
shoulder injuries
separation - acromion + clavicle are separated
- type 1 = injry ot capusle around AC joint - bruise 
- 2 = ligaments are torn , ripped, AC joint capsule, visible bump 
- 3 = type 2 but more severe and larger bump, all ligaments torn 
- 4 = when clavicle pushed behind AC joint 
- 5 = superspinatous muscle is punctured by that clavicle pushed back, causing a significant bump 
- 6 = clavicle pusehd down + lodged below corocoid process, needs surgery 
- treat = usually antiinflammatory, resting, etc. types 4-6 need surgery. 
- type 3 hard to manage and surgery depends

shoulder DISLOCATION = is different, happens when HUMERUS is displaced from the socket anteriorly 

ulnar collateral ligament injury 
- baseball injruy - throwing of pitchers
- complete anterior band tear 
- surgical repair = tommy john surg
- transplant donor tendon usually palmaris longus, translocation of ulnar nerve up , threaing thru drilled holes in medial epicondyle and coronoid process of ulna 

elbow joint injuries
olecranon bursitis = sac fills with liquid with inflammation, notable swelling behind elbow + aggravation by having it on hard surfaces
- pain around back of elbow, swelling over it, limited motion slightly 
- drain the swollen bursa. + inject steroids 

pulled elbow 
- stretching / nursemaids elbow - stretching + tearing of annular ligament (not as tight when ur a kid!) [[Chunking Psych + maybe some social factors?]]
- - pain due to entrapment of annular ligament between radial head + capitulum of humerus
- reduction by supination in flexed position 

colle's fracture = most common fracture of forearm, if you fall and don't end up fracturing ur scaphoi
- transverse fracture of distal radius, with avulsion fracture of styloid of ulna 
- forced dorsiflexion of hand... dinner fork, kinda curved 


wrist injury of joint 
- grade 1 = mild, no ligament tear just stretch 
- 2 = moderate, torn ligaments
- 3 = severe, ligament cmpletely torn, instability in hands. 
- RICE for healing this with the wrist sprain 

arthritises
- RA = radial dev of wrist with ulnar deviation of digits = z deformity 
	- hyperplasia = hypertrophy of synovial cells= pannus 
	- MCP/PIP
osteoarthritis - age relted, 80% degen by 65 
- leading cause of disability 
- CMC, IP joints
