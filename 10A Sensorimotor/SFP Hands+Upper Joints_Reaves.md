- hand = distal to the carpal bones
5 metacarpal bones 1-5 starting with thumb 
each metacarpal has 
- base - articulates with 1+ carpal bones 
- shaft
- head - articulate distally with phalanx. 
metacarpal bones  
are slightly triangular in cross-section  
and present a palmar concavity in  
their length.

fingers -3 phalanges (prox, mid , distal )
thumb - 2 prox + distal 

Each phalanx has a base, shaft and  
head.
- the sesamoid bones are on the MCP of thumb and sometimes are at the index mcp 
- like a sesame seed on xray, bone in a tendon/ muscle 

bursa of hand = continuation from wrist/forearm, 
- radial bursa which is tendinous sheth of flexor pollicis longus +
- ulnar bursa which is the common flexor sheath 

ulnar and median nerves have essentially innervated the palms. both  have palmar br and a common and proper palmar digital br 
- palmar br 
- common palmar digital br
- proper palmar digital brs 
note; small area of anterior aspect of base of **thumb** = lateral band is innervated by the **superficial br of radial nerve**

superficial branch of the radial nerve  
(dorsal digital nerves) innervates the  
dorsal aspect of the lateral 3½  
fingers - these don't extend beyond middle phalanges ... proper palmar digital brs of median nerve innervate distal ends of lateral 3 1/2 fingers 

##### All For One And One For All
This mnemonic recalls the intrinsic muscles of the hand in their relative palmar anatomical position from lateral to medial:

- **A:** [abductor pollicis brevis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/abductor-pollicis-brevis-muscle?lang=us)
- **F:** [flexor pollicis brevis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/flexor-pollicis-brevis-muscle?lang=us)
- **O:** [opponens pollicis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/opponens-pollicis-muscle?lang=us)
- **A:** [adductor pollicis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/adductor-pollicis-muscle?lang=us)

- **A:** [abductor digiti minimi](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/abductor-digiti-minimi-muscle-hand?lang=us)

##### PAd DAb
This mnemonic recalls the function of the palmar and dorsal [interossei](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/interossei-muscles-of-the-hand?lang=us "Interossei muscles of the hand"):
- **P:** [palmar interossei](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/palmar-interossei-muscles-hand?lang=us)
- **Ad:** adduction
- **D:** [dorsal interossei](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dorsal-interossei-muscles-hand-1?lang=us)
- **Ab:** abduction
