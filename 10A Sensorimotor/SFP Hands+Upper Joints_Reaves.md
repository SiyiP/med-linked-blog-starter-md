- hand = distal to the carpal bones
5 metacarpal bones **1-5 starting with thumb** 
each metacarpal has 
- base - articulates with 1+ carpal bones 
- shaft
- head - articulate distally with phalanx. 
metacarpal bones  
are slightly triangular in cross-section  
and present a palmar concavity in  
their length.

fingers -3 phalanges (prox, mid , distal )
thumb - 2 prox + distal 
- sesamoid bones - free floating bones that would allow for movement facilitation, seen in larger ones. 

Each phalanx has a base, shaft and head.
- the sesamoid bones are on the MCP of thumb and sometimes are at the index mcp 
- like a sesame seed on xray, bone in a tendon/ muscle 

bursa of hand = continuation from wrist/forearm, 
- radial bursa which is tendinous sheth of flexor pollicis longus +
- ulnar bursa which is the common flexor sheath 
- named for the nerves
- phalangeal bursa in between PIP and DIP 
recall: 
- cephalic vein from lateral aspect
- basilic from medial aspect of dorsal venous arch 
- joined by median cubital v 
- these two veins will infiltrate hand , just drain 

dermatomes:
C6 = skin of thumb  / lateral part of forearm 
C7 = skin of index, mid finger + ring fingers, middle part of hand
C8 = skin of little finger , medial hand, distal forearm 

extrensic mulscles on dorsal + palmar surfaces review from forearm 

note muscle gruops
- there's a pamar aponeurosis that is attached to flexor retinaculum, with 4 fibrous slips that extends to each finger. 
- small muscle in the medial side of hand = palmaris brevis 
- some diseases of the fascia
	- dupuytren's disease = collagen overgrowth, inability to extend the hand
	- thenar vs hypothenar(fifth digit) eminences
	- intrinsic v extrensic 

movements
abduction + adduction is with reference to axis passing thru middle finger. 
thumb = movements are in ref to plane of palm of hand. 

thenar eminence- technically extrinsic, origin from carpal bones 
- abductor pollicis brevis - move thumb away from palm - most medial
	- superficial + anterior in thenar eminence
	- origin - flexor retinaculum + carpals
	- insert into lateral aspect of base of proximal phalanx of thumb with the flexor pollicis brevis
	- abduction of the thumb at carpometaarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints 
- flexor pollicis brevis - thumb flexion - middle 
	- 2 heads, superficial + deep head. 
	- originate from lat + anterior surface of flexor retinaculum 
	- insert into lateral aspect of base of proximal phalanx of thumb with the abductor pollicis brevis; sometimes attached to sesamoid bone 
	- flex that metacarpophalangeal joint of thumb 
- opponens pollicis - opposition - most lateral 
	- DEEP to abductor pollicis brevis
	- origin lateral and anterior surface of flexor retinaculum 
	- inserts into entire length of lateral border of shaft of the first metacarpal bone!!!
	- makes sense that it's the most lateral, since we have to reach all the way to the pinky! 

adductor pollicis - 4th short musle of thumb but not in the thenar eminence
- 2 heads (oblique + transverse)
- origin - oblique head from anterior surfaces of base w/ 2nd/3rd metacarpal... transverse head from anterior surface of 3rd metacarpal 
- insertion - medial side of base of prox phalanx of thumb 
- one line to the palm formed by muscle = adduction of carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints 


---
hypothenar eminence - technically extrinsic, origin from carpal bones 
abductor digiti minimi
- superficial + medial in hypotheniar eminence
- origin = pisiform bone
- inserts into medial side of base of proximal phalanx in the little finger, so this is like 
- abduction of metacarpophalangeal joint of the little finger 
	- basically the insertion point into the side/medial side of base in proximal phalanx...
	- when it CONTRACts, it pulls finger to side slightly basically 

flexor digiti minimi
- origin from medial portion of anterior surface of flexor retinaculum  , just deep to the abductor
- insertion into medial side of base of proximal phalanx of little finger 
- flexion of metacarpophalangeal joint of little finger 
-  whole finger goes forth 

opponens digiti minimi 
- from medial portion of ant surface of flexor retinaculum, 
- similar insertion into entire legnth of medial border of 5th metacarpal bone, bringing the little finger into opposition with thumb 

actual intrinsic muscles of the hand 
lumbrical muscles (4)
- from tendons of **flexor digitorum profundus**- 
- insertion onto the LATERAL side of the corresponding extensor expansion hoods 
- first 2 = **one head**
- 3-4 have 2 heads 
- flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints + extend the interphalangeal joints too 
	- expansion hood insertion = basically it would be the most **superficial** muscle that inserts underneath, allowing extension of intrphalangeal joints 
	- flexion of metacapophalangeal joints. 

palmar interossei muscles (3)
- from anterior surface of shaft of 2nd, 4th, 5th metacarbal bones
- insertion **into proximal phalanges, onto the side closest to the middle finger**
	- adduct index, ring, and little finger , since origin point is metacarpal bones. pulling everything in, near the axial line. 
- also insert into extensor expansions of index, ring, little fingers
	- flex metacarpophalangeal joitns 
	- while extending the interphalangeal joints of those 3 fingers
- Think: PAD: Three palmar interosseous muscles ad ADductors
- ADductors = PAD, taking 2,4,5 towards the axial line down middle finger 

dorsal interossei muscles (4)
- 2 heads
- from adjacent sids of metacarpal bones
- insert into proximal phalanges + extensor expansions of index, middle and ring fingers... 
	- 2 muscles dedicated to the middle finger
	this can mean that the middle finger can move in **both directions** but everything else just in one direction
- abduction, pulling apart fingers, 
- also insertion into extensor expansions = this is the most dorsal / posterior 
	- same movements as 	- flex the metacarpophalangeal joints + extend the interphalangeal joints of these 3 fingers 
- 4 dorsal interosseuous muscles are ABductors DAB - move 2,3,4 away from midline 

thenar space. = first lumbrical = lateral posterior to long flexor tendon 
- 3 lumbricals = posterior to long flexor tnedons of mid, ring, little fingers

superficial palmar arch 
- ulnar a = pass superficial to flexor retinaculum, lateral to ulnar n + pisiform 
	- gives deep palmar br , deep to palmar apon. anterior to long flexor tendons -> **making superficial palmar arch**
	- anastomose w/ superficial palmar br from the radial artery 
- 3 common br palmar digital a... divides self into **proper palmar digital a** to each finger... 1 proper one to litte finger

radial a - from anterior aspect of wrist to lat side -> **posterior aspect of hand**
	passes beneath tendons of **abductor pollicis longus+extensor pollicis muscles**
	dives bt 2 heads of first dorsal interosseous musc to pass bt transverse + oblique heads of adductor pollicis muscle
- note = common palmar digital arteries, **until it will bifurcate into proper palmar digital arteries** 
	- happens in the web spaces of the fingers 

deep palmar arch - 
- deep br of ulnar will travel posterior ,,, and will connect with the radial artery anastamoses. 
- arch = deep to **long flexor tendons, anterior to metacarpal bones + itnerosseuous**
- 3 small palmar metacarpal a a**nastamose with matching arteries from superficial arch** 
	- **radialis indicis a** to lateral side of index finger + the **princeps pollicis artery** to both sides of thumb
	- radialis indicis artery will supply to the index finger deeply 
	- princeps pollicis artery = supply to the thumb 

allen's test = to check patency of radial and ulnar aa 
- radial a is largest artery of the hand 
- place finger on the ulnar a and radial arteries, taking these pulses. 


ulnar and median nerves have essentially innervated the palms. both  have palmar br and a common and proper palmar digital br 
- palmar br 
- common palmar digital br
- proper palmar digital brs 
note; small area of anterior aspect of base of **thumb** = lateral band is innervated by the **superficial br of radial nerve**

superficial branch of the radial nerve  
(dorsal digital nerves) innervates the  
dorsal aspect of the lateral 3½  
fingers - these don't extend beyond middle phalanges ... proper palmar digital brs of median nerve innervate distal ends of lateral 3 1/2 fingers
