- hand = distal to the carpal bones
5 metacarpal bones **1-5 starting with thumb** 
each metacarpal has 
- base - articulates with 1+ carpal bones 
- shaft
- head - articulate distally with phalanx. 
metacarpal bones  
are slightly triangular in cross-section  
and present a palmar concavity in  
their length.

fingers -3 phalanges (prox, mid , distal )
thumb - 2 prox + distal 
- sesamoid bones - free floating bones that would allow for movement facilitation, seen in larger ones. 

Each phalanx has a base, shaft and head.
- the sesamoid bones are on the MCP of thumb and sometimes are at the index mcp 
- like a sesame seed on xray, bone in a tendon/ muscle 

bursa of hand = continuation from wrist/forearm, 
- radial bursa which is tendinous sheth of flexor pollicis longus +
- ulnar bursa which is the common flexor sheath 
- named for the nerves
- phalangeal bursa in between PIP and DIP 
recall: 
- cephalic vein from lateral aspect
- basilic from medial aspect of dorsal venous arch 
- joined by median cubital v 
- these two veins will infiltrate hand , just drain 

dermatomes:
C6 = skin of thumb  / lateral part of forearm 
C7 = skin of index, mid finger + ring fingers, middle part of hand
C8 = skin of little finger , medial hand, distal forearm 

extrensic mulscles on dorsal + palmar surfaces review from forearm 

note muscle gruops
- there's a pamar aponeurosis that is attached to flexor retinaculum, with 4 fibrous slips that extends to each finger. 
- small muscle in the medial side of hand = palmaris brevis 
- some diseases of the fascia
	- dupuytren's disease = collagen overgrowth, inability to extend the hand
	- thenar vs hypothenar(fifth digit) eminences
	- intrinsic v extrensic 

movements
abduction + adduction is with reference to axis passing thru middle finger. 
thumb = movements are in ref to plane of palm of hand. 

thenar eminence
- abductor pollicis brevis - move thumb away from palm - most medial
	- superficial + anterior in thenar eminence
	- origin - flexor retinaculum + carpals
	- insert into lateral aspect of base of proximal phalanx of thumb with the flexor pollicis brevis
	- abduction of the thumb at carpometaarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints 
- flexor pollicis brevis - thumb flexion - middle 
	- 2 heads, superficial + deep head. 
	- originate from lat + anterior surface of flexor retinaculum 
	- insert into lateral aspect of base of proximal phalanx of thumb with the abductor pollicis brevis; sometimes attached to sesamoid bone 
	- flex that metacarpophalangeal joint of thumb 
- opponens pollicis - opposition - most lateral 
	- DEEP to abductor pollicis brevis
	- origin lateral and anterior surface of flexor retinaculum 
	- inserts into entire length of lateral border of shaft of the first metacarpal bone!!!
	- makes sense that it's the most lateral, since we have to reach all the way to the pinky! 

adductor pollicis - 4th short musle of thumb but not in the thenar eminence
- 2 heads (oblique + transverse)
- origin - oblique 

ulnar and median nerves have essentially innervated the palms. both  have palmar br and a common and proper palmar digital br 
- palmar br 
- common palmar digital br
- proper palmar digital brs 
note; small area of anterior aspect of base of **thumb** = lateral band is innervated by the **superficial br of radial nerve**

superficial branch of the radial nerve  
(dorsal digital nerves) innervates the  
dorsal aspect of the lateral 3½  
fingers - these don't extend beyond middle phalanges ... proper palmar digital brs of median nerve innervate distal ends of lateral 3 1/2 fingers 

##### All For One And One For All
