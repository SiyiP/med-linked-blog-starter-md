anatomical bone structure
1. long bones - femur, tibia, humerus 
	- shaft of bone = diaphysis 
	- epiphysis = on the ends of the bone 
	- articular surfaces = cover the epiphysis, in hyaline cartilage 
	- metaphysis - neck between diaphysis and epihysis 
		- very vascular tissue = the bones usually 
	- nutrient canal - an artery comes in and apendices are inside these
2. short bones - carpal bones of wrist
	- only difference: don't have epiphysis and diaphysis note; **equal in length and diameters**
3. flat/membrane bones like skulls - 
	- internal plate - plate of compact bones
	- diploe - spongey layer on inside between the plates 
	- external plate -  plate of compact bones

specialized CT comprised of 4 primary cell types and elaborate calcified ECM = bone matrix 
- mostly type 1 collagen **embedded in ground substance, tight, fibrous**
		- proteoglycans with chondroitin sulfate + keratin sulfate
		- adhesive glycoprtoeins like **dentin matrix protein DMP and osteopontin**
		- calcium binding proteins - osteocalcin + osteonectin 
		- protein phosphatases,
		- growth factors/cytokines
	- inorganic components of bone matrix: **what hardens it - calcium and phosphat to make hydroxyapatite crystals, large ones made up of ca and phosphate!!!** , most of our body's calcium is in these! 
cells in bones 
- osteocytes - trapped in lacunae, terminally differentiated, and communicate via canaliculi in bone matrix to make gap junctions; maintaining the bone matrix + participating in remodding of the matrix/bone matabolism. **substantial effects on Ca2+ and PO4+ in the blood**
	- the ones that **AREN't in lacunae,** but on the surfaces of bone have cytoplasmic processes that communicate with the lacunae ones thru canaliculi 
		- these are **bone-lining cells**
		- they will be flattened cells, forming gap junctions still 
		- relatively **inactive/quiescent, but retain ability to differentiate into osteoBLASTS in bone remodding**
	- these are in between lamella.... **from osteoblasts that became by bone matrix**
	- send out long processes thru canaliculi and communicate with others by making gap junctions. can also form these with osteoblasts. 
	- can also reach into the BVs, like if they're close to a haversian canal etc. 
	- in lacunae, and nutrients transported thru these cytoplasmic processes away from haversian canal. 
	- note; **there's a small extracellular space in lumen of canaliculi transports molecules by passive diffusion. basically there's a cellular route of nutrient transport and an extracellular one**
	- bone marrow cells are separated from bone tissue by endosteum.
	- bottom line: they sense mechanical stress in bones within processes of canaliculi thru ECM fluid movement... this is a newer thing 
		- this generates an electric potential, resulting in activation of voltage gated Ca2+ in these that **triggers bone formation**
		- alternatively we **promote bone resorption** in response to redution in mechanical forces, by stimulating osteocyts to secrete **matrix metalloproteinases MMPs**
- osteoblasts - syntehsis + mineralization of bone matrix during growth/remodding, but later differentiated into osteocytes in lacunae/lining bone surfaces
	- more metabolically active than osteocytes. 
	- making organic matrix of bone: **OSTEoid**
	- express receptors for **PTH and vitamin D3/VDR**
	- usually cuboidal, making a single layer on the surface of a **forming bone**
	- euchromatic nucleus + basophilic cytoplasm due to many **RER involved in so much protein synthesis**
	- communication with osteocytes via canaliculi, can also later become osteocytes.
	- major secretory products of osteoblasts/osteoid
		- type 1 collagen = 90-95%
		- proteoglycans
		- osteocalcin
		- osteonectin
		- osteopontin, 
		- alkaline phosphatase 
	- mineralization of bone - secretion of alk phosphatases to inc PO4- , Ca2+ binding proteins osteocalcin and osteonectin and adhesive protein osteopontin 
		- these lead to formation of **hydroxyaptite crystals embeding collagen and proteoglycans in bone matrix**
- osteoprogenitor cells - mesenchymal stem cells differentating into blasts and cytes
	- don't have to recognize them, basicallly flattened cells 
	- know they're on the inner/outer surfaces of bones 
	- from mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow
- osteoclasts - **monocyte lineage**, multilineatedd that resorb and remodel bone. 
	- large multinucleated cells!!! from the bone marrow
	- function in bone resorption during growth and remodding of matrix 
	- located in cavities/depressions of bone called **howship's lacuna, as they're active**
	- stain eosinophilic bc mitochondria 
	- they attach to bones via **integrins, making a ruffled border to contact SA up**
		- then the contact zone is surrounded by cytoplasmic ring/collar of actin filaments, sealing off extracellular space with low pH 
		- the clasts have **carbonic anhydrase II** which catelyzes h2o + CO2 -> H2CO3, disassociating onto H+ and HCO3-
			- more acidic!!!
			- H+ transported into extracellular space, and then biarb back into the blood
			- we will make HCl bc the H+ is put in the extracellular space WHILE Cl- is transported
	- **very strong acid environment** = making lysosomal enzymes activate like cathepsin K and collagenase, making howships lacuna formed and then these enzymes degrade osteoid and then **low pH facilitates release/redistrib of Ca2+ , dissolving hydroxyapatite crystals**
how does differntiation/activation work? 
	- pre-osteoclasts - monocyte lineage from progenitor cells CFU-GM, of hematopoiesis in the bone marrow ; these have a receptor called RANK 
		- rank = receptor activator of nulear factor kB
		- RANKL = ligand 
	- osteoBLASTS express RANKL to bind to RANK on the pre-osteoclasts => fusion to form mature osteoclast!!
	- RANKL binds to rank expressed by mature osteoclast to make activation! 
	- OPG = **a decoy receptor !!! osteoprotegerin, gets released by *osteoblasts* that binds to RANKL, sequestring it, preventing osteoclast formation+activation.**
	- PtH = binds to GPCRs on osteoblasts, which is called PTH1R in osteoblasts
		- this makes RANKL secretion increase. 
		- and this ligand binding to osteoblasts also decreases OPG secretion
		- in total, this will stimulate more and more RANK-RANKL binding, so more mature osteoclasts activity 
		- **increased ca2+ levels bc promotion of bone resorption , inc Ca2+ and PO4- to the extracellular fluid**
	- calcitonin - binds to hCTR1 on **osteoclasts**
		- decrease the number 
		- inibit secretory/resorptive acitivty of mature osteoclasts
		- decreasing ca2+ levels in blood by inhibiting bone resorption by osteoclasts 
when plasma calcium levels are low -> trigger PTH 
when plasma calcium levels are higher -> calcitonin secretion 
sensing these changes via the receptors!!

types of bone tissue
1. spongey bone - cancellous bone 
	1. composed of bone spicules, or trabeculae , in lattice like network
	2. mainly in epiphyses of long bones , and the diploe between the plates of compact bones! 
	3. helps to lighten the bone and forms the cavity where the bone marrow is ! 
	4. this scaffolding lightens but the lattice network is still veryyyy strong 
2. compact/dense bone 
	1. makes the diaphysis and lines outer surface of epiphyses
	2. inner and outer plates of flat bones 
	3. continues all around the metaphysis and stuff, even underneath where the articular cartilage would be. 

coverings of bone!!!
- periosteum - on the outside surface, 2 layers
	- fibrous layer - dense, irreg CT, with **blood vessels**
		- collagen fibers will be sharpey or perforating fibers that extend INTO the bone matrix, binding it tight to underlying bone 
		- very hard to get periosteum off bone bc these will keep it on 
	- cellular layer - underneath - more of the **vascular layer** with periosteom, has osteoprogenitor cells that can differentiate. 
- inner surface; endosteum - thin cell layer, like 1-2 cells that line these including the marrow cavity + traveculae of spongey bone
	- mainly just osteoprogenitor cells.

structure + function of lamellar/mature bone - actual histology 
- both compact/spongey bone is organized into **multiple layers of calcified bone matrix = lamellar bone!** - layered bone 
- collagen fibers in a layer of lamella of bone matrix are arranged in either **parallel or concntrically around a central/haversian canal**
	- we see a "wedding cake" of collagen fibers, that are oriented with right angles to each other.... 
	- direction of collagen always oriented at right angles. 
	- osteocytes are in between each of the layers 

haversian system  
- **osteon = primary** **structural unit of COMPACT bone**
	- 4-10 concentric lamellae around the haversian central canal!!! 
	- haversian canals lined by endosteum and having BVs, 
	- osteocytes in lacunae will be situated between these layers 
	- in the center = we have an arteriole, venule, and a nerve as welll!! lined by the endosteum 
	- osteocytes will communicate via gap junctions sending out long slender processes called **filopodia thru the canaliculi**
- volkmann canals - how the central canals are connected to each other , on the sides, via these conduits. very rich network of blood vessels
	- we will see tangental dark tunnels. 
- the endosteum is continuous in this way. 
- note: around the central canal, we can see endosteum lining it, and then surrounding that we see layers/lamella of bone tissue
	- **dark areas of tissue = the osteocytes are all there**
	- and we can see all the canaliculi there between osteocytes. 

will also see in compact bone: intersitital lamella
- these are layered **lamellae in between osteons!!!!!**
- fills in these games between osteon units, shows how active the bones are 
compact bone at histo levels: 
- external circumferential lamellae - situated deep to periosteum ; we see layered bone, not the osteons just yet 
- internal circumferential lamellae - surrounding marrow cavity - layers that just wrap around the very inside 
- we can see periosteum: outer layer more fibrous, inner layer more cellular 
the blood supply of compact bone
- we can see nutrient foramina - 
	- in long bones - seen in the epiphysis 
	- most of this is provided by arteries entering into the nutrient foramina 
	- blood vessels can extend outward thru volkmann canals, these big arteries in the marrow branching out into the denser bone part of the bones...  
	- portion of the blood supply from branches of periosteal arteries, supplying outer part of the bone

histo of spongey bone
- or cancellous bone 
- also layered into lamellae, only difference is having these spicules, which are still in layers. 
- still have formation communication with gap unctions
- usually doesn't have haversian systems bc the trabeculae are thin, allowing for effective nutrient diffusion from marrow - 


osteoporosis - when bone resorption > bone formation 
- bone loss + reduced bone density 
- common in postmenopausal women + chronically immobilized pts
- 2 major changes: 
	- **thinner spicules/trabeculae**
	- bigger spaces in scaffolding of tissue.
