3 types of cartilage and ECM compositions and locations of them all. 
1. ==hyaline cartilage - most broadly distributed , covers all articulate processes==
	- ==type 2== , ==homogenous==, ==aggrecan (supramolecular complex of proteoglycans with hyaluronate)==
	- lots of type 2, many proteoglycans etc, giving a smooth appearance 
	- ==from mesodermal mesenchyme==, aggregation of these mesenchymal cells, and then ==will differentiate into chondroblasts== + then get ==physically separate into lacunae.== 
	- ==isogenous groups form as mitosis== 
	- ==**avascular, surrounded by perichondrium EXCEPT in articular cartilage**==
	- ==hyaline cartilage = **initial SKELETON OF EMBRYO**==
	- articular cartilage of joints + respiratory tract 
	- gross appearance - **smooth, glass-like!**
2. ==fibrocartilage - in the pubic symphysis etc==
	- ==has type 2 collagen, but very large areas of **type 1 collagen**, STRIATED / interstitial like appearance== 
	- ==avascular, **LACKS a PERICHONDRIUM!!!**==
		- so there needs to be a retrodistal CT at the mandibulum, rich in many lymphatics and BVs to provide nutrients and o2 to this  
	- ==chondrocytes make collagen type 2 and **fibroblasts type 1**==
	- ==intermediate between hyaline cartilage and dense fibrous CT==
	- ==**intervertebral discs, menisci of knee joint and articular disc of temporal mandibular joint**==
		- internal: nucleus pulposus, irch in hyaluronate and water
		- ==anulus fibrosus on hte outside- rich in type 1 collagen to absorb shock.== 
		- ==orthogonally arr\anged fibers resist shock and stress.== 
		- menisci of knee joint - are C-shaped cartilages that surrounded these WITH the hyaline cartilage. 
	- ==chondrocytes have to **align along the lines of stress due to type 1 collagen!!!**==
		- these are ==all surrounded by lacunae==, this will help us distinguish from just any tendon. 
		- ==alignment of chondrocytes in their lacunae, see heterogenity of these all.== 
3. ==elastic cartilage. - most limited distribution, in external ear and epiglottis== 
	- ==type 2 collagens, aggrecans, but **darker elastic fibers**, we see more heterogenous appearance in the interterritorial matrix== 
	- ==avascular, surrounded by perichondrium== 
	- elastin can be ==stained with orcein , resorcin== 
	- ==heterogenous== appearance, we see ==dark circles around the lighter lacunae... looks like "plate of oysters"==

role of ==eCM in cartilage:== 
- ==shock absorber due to stiffness of structured water== 
- lubricated surface for movable joints! 
	- ==lube fluid: hyaluronic acid, immunoglobins, lysosomal enzyms, collagenase + glycoproteins that are produced by the synovial lining of the capsule of joint== 
	- ==synovial fluid are for dx of joint diseases!!!!== 

overall, cells in these cartilages are small, 3-5%
- 15% collagens, and 80% of that are collagen type 2. 
- like 60-80% = of **cartilage is intercellular WATER!!!**
	- water complexed with charged GAGs, giving cushioning and resilience to the cartilage 
	- proteoglycan aggregates in aggrecans: 
		- ==recall: proteoglycans are stuck onto the linker proteins that are stuck onto a **hyaluronan molecule** via linker protein== 
		- **GAGs = chondroitin sulfates are small lines as well as keratan sulfate attached to the proteoglycans!!!!**
		- we have these all inside an aggrecan. broadly dispersed, the gAG groups will structure the water. 
==![[proteoglycan aggregate.png]]==
interaction of these large aggrecans and the proteoglycans - they will associate with other ECMs to stabilize it all! 



---

==chondrocytes = born as condrablasts, which will secrete ECM and deposit them in the periphery, so they will become enclosed and physically separate from one another, enclosed in the lacunar rim more and more== 
- like a sponge with swiss cheese, the ECM that the condroblasts/cytes that they live in, and the holes are the cells. 
- ==chrondrocytes have a well developped R endoplastmic reticulum, they have round nucleus with nucelolus , many secretory vesicles== 
- they're initially close to one another but torn apart bc of the ECM secreted 
1. pericellular matrix - at the periphery of chrondrocyte cell membrane 
2. territorial matrix - adjacent to pericellular matrix 
3. intraterritorial matrix - ECM between chondrocytes and their lacunae 
![[many chondrocytes.png]]
see: large round nucleus, prominent nucleolus, the rim of matrix in magenta, pericellular matrix, and then thespace surrounding it is territorial matrix , and the broad light blue around = intraterritorial

lacunum = the red line, holding these 2 chondrocytes in the same lacunum, an isogenous group. they can go thru mitosis, which is why they're isogenous. 
electron dense lighter stuff near the launar border = pericellular matrix 
territorial matrix, is the part immediately surrounding the lacunar border 
- intraterritorial vs territorial difference is the proportions of proteoglycans and collagen 
- ==prodom collagen = type 2== 
	- ==territorial matrix = **looser arrangement of type 2 collagen, higher proteoglycans**; if you have a limited space, closer to you you need more wiggle room!!!==
	- ==intraterritorial - more tight arrangement of type 2 collagen complexed with proteoglycans==

how does cartilage grow??? 
interstitial growth: 
chondrocytes = they are the ones that synthesize and secrete ECM as they deposite!!! sequested in that space , undergoes mitotic cell division as isogenous groups 
- as it gets larger and larger, the matrix would offer resistance
- this will mean **cartilage is limited in size, bc of the matrix and bc it has no blood supply!**

==appositional growth - growth from the periphery, depends on the collagen type 1 perichrondrium around the cartilage== 
- on the perichondrium = **cells with a fibroblast appearance, flatter cells**
	- these can become chondroblasts!!!!
	- flattened nuclei, as they get closer and closer to the perichondrium and the edge of cartilage, they can start synthesizing and secreting the ECM proteins, and get more and more similar to the chondroblast. 
	- typical of perichrondrium: outer fibrous layer, inner cellular layer. 
	- blood vessel penetrates the perichondrium, providing support to the perichondrium itself. 
	- **due to perichondrium - it can continue to grow cartilage, such as your nose can grow from age!** 

repair after injury?
- limited but modest repair capacity 
- ==injuries happen but results in the formation of **repair cartilage, from perichondrium**==
	- has undifferentiated cells which have potential to differentiate into chondrocytes 
	- ==repair cartilages = matrix compositions are **intermediate btween hyaline and fibrous cartilage**==
		- ==like it has both type 1 and 2 collagen== 
	- note: we don't have hyaline cartilage perichondrium at articulations , we especially rely on this
