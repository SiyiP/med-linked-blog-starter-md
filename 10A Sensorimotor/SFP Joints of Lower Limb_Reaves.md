hip bone review features
- observe lunate shape of acetabulum + acetabular notch 
- ischial tuberoosty - what you sit on 
hip joint 
- acetabulum = 3 bones in one ; ilium pubs + ischium 
- synovial multiaxial ball and socket joint 
- design for stability first and mobility 2nd. 
- articular surfaces of hip = acetabulum + femur head 
- thic hyaline cartilage, 2/3 of head of femur 
- but not the fovea capitis, ligament of head of femur - the acetabular branch of the artery to protrude to head of femur 
- fibrocartilage rim = acetabular labrum = will attach to margins of acetabulum, deepening and inc stability of hip joint, continuous with transverse ligament of acetabulum 
femur
- head, neck, intertrocanteric crest + line 
- recall: angle of **inclination is about 125 degrees**
- some ppl have diff
	- coxa valga = greater trocanter abnormally low, angle is more than 125 - inability to adduct 
	- greater trchanter abnormally ihgh = less than 125 degrees, coxa vara = inability to abduct 
capsule fibrous are thick and strong attaching to acetabulum, outer margin of labrum + transverse ligament of acetabulum 
distally to posterior femoral neck+ anteriorly to intertrochanteric lines. 
- has longituidinal and circular fibers (zona orbicularis) = atach to outer margin of greater trochanter 
round ligament of head fo femur attach to transverse ligament of acetabulum, on margins of the notch and in pit of fovea capitis 
allows for - passage of **small a br off the obturator into the femoral head from the acetabular notch**
- transverse ligament of actabulum bridges over that notch 

anterior ligaments
- iliofemoral ligament - y shaped, from AIIs to lower parts of intertrochanteric line inferiorly 
	- prevents overextension!
- pubofemoral ligament
	- from superior ramus of pubis to inf part of intertrochanteric line
	- limit hip abduction 
	- more horizontal 
posterior ligament 
- ischiofemoral ligaments
- spiral shaped, attached near the superior border of acetabular margin to laterally attach to greater trochanter, limiting hip extension 
bursae
- subtendinous iliac bursa in beteen the iliofemoral and pubofemoral ligament s
- ischiogluteal bursa = on the ischial tuberosities 
- trochanteric bursae - 
	- deep troch bursae bt greater trochanter + gluteus max
	- superficial trochanteric bursa bt greater trochanter + subq tissue 
- in the gluteus max, med, minimus will facilitate movement 
nerve supply to hip 
- femoral L2-4 
- obturator l2-4 
- accessory obturator l3-l4
- sciatic n L4-S3
- n to quadratus femoris - L4-S1 
only exception to hiltons law - piriformis nerve s1-2 does not supply hip 

blood supply - 
- anastomosis of br of obturator, medial + lat circumflex femoral + superior + inf gluteal aa 
- small aa = retinacular aa - br of lateral + medial femoral circumflex aa penetrate length of neck + small branch from obturator a provide blood supply to head of femur 
- clinical fractures of neck of femur can dmg retinacular aas. 
	- necrotic neck - need total hip replacement 
	- and acetabular br can also tear, need hip replacement 3 pins to repair it ... 

hip movements
- recall - moving hip = moving entire lower limb 
knee w skin removed - holds up relatively well 
- see ligament of patella, attaching to tuberosity 
- popliteus muscle to the lat meniscus and femur to unlcok the knee 
- posterior cruciate and fibular collateral ligament 
- there's lateral collateral of both elbow and knee
knee = modded hinge bt medial + lat femoral + tibial condyles = synovial condylar joint 
glinding joint bt patella + patella surface of femmur which is also part of knee joint 
patella - sesamoid bone, largest, vert ridge bt lat + medial articular surfaces, triangular 
- medial condyle of fibula and tibia = oval 
- lateral condyle = round 
- adductor tubercle on femur + intercondylar notch 
- on tibia. we have both the med + laat intercondyle tubercles and intercondylar fossa, both anterior + posterior 
- oval outline = the up and down movements, lateral rotation of tibia under the femur at the end of extension of knee during gait 

menisci. - semilunar fibrcartilages - pripheral border is thick, attached to capsule
- inner border is thin + makes free edge
- femoral surface = smooth + concave + thir tibial surface is flat
- to compensate for incongruity bt tibia + femur 
- has ant + posterior horns 
anterior capsule of knee
- quads tendon 
- ligamentum patella
- medial + lateral patella retinacula
- expansion from iliotibial tract = suprior patella retinaculum 
	- patella stabilization ligaments
	- medial patellofemoral ligament - strongest one, rpovides the most stabilization of knee
	- lateral patellofemoral - on the sides. 
posterior one 
- semimembranous tendon + exension 
- oblique popliteal ligament
- arcuate popliteal ligament passing over the popliteus muscle 
lateral collateral ligament/fibular collateral ligament = **round cord**
- this is extending from lat epicondyl of femur abov the groove of popliteus, down and back to the head of fibula 
- covered by tendon of biceps femoris. 
- does NOT attah to the menicsus
medial collateral lig - tibial collateral ligament - a broad wide flat band from medial epicondyle of femur down and forward onto medial condyl of tibial... 
- crossed by tendons of sartorius, gracilis, and semitendonosus muscls
- **attached to medial meniscus** 


cruciate ligaments 
2 intracapsular ligaments
- anterior cruciate ligament - from anterior intercondylar area of tibia, running laterally to the psterior part of medial surface of lat femoral condyle 
- posterior cruciate ligaments - posterior. = running opposite direction from the posterior intercondylar area of tibia, superior and anterior and medially to the medial condyle of femur 
- they're cruciate bc they criss cross in the middl eof hte knee (: )
bursae of knee
- suprapatella bursa 
- subcutaneous prepatellar bursa bt skin + patella 
	- 	- can lead to prepatellar bursitis = **housemaid's knee - friction bt skin + patella. fluid with inflamatory cells lead to swelling**
	- spreads quickly to other bursa 
- subq infrapatella bursa - superficial below patella
- deep infrapatellar bursa - deep below patella 
deep bursae is found deep to 
- gastrocnemisu heads
- biceps femoris 
- fibular collateral ligament
- popliteus
- semimembranosus bursae 
supportive structures = medial asepct of knee
- vastus medialis obliqu = distal portion of vastus medialis, horizontally oriented and extends lower than you expect 
- pes anserinus = sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus attachmnt will flex + medially rotate tibia 
	- different innervation + acts on 2 joints, each originates for 1 of the 3 bones of pelvis 
test collateral ligaments; collateral ligaments will prevent abduction or adduction of knee joints 
- abduction - valgus, testing **medial collateral ligament, put pressure on the lateral side**
- adduction varus test =test the lateral collateral ligament and push on the medial side. 

anterior cruciate ligaments = lachman test
- gold standard
- put them in supine position, 20-30 degrees ith flex and leg external rotation 
- one hand behind tibia, other on the thigh/distal femur
- thumb put on tibial tuberosity, intact acl will prevent forward **movement of tibia...**
- anterior displacment = soft/mushy endpoint instead of firm one. 
posterior cruciate ligament will be pushing the leg trying to go posteriorly to make sure posterior cruciate ligaments work. 

blood supply 
- descending br of lateral femoral circumflex a
- genicular br of popliteal a (recall all the superior, inf, and middle ones)
- descending genicular a from femoral a 
- recurrent brs from anterior tibial a 
nerve supply 
- femoral 
- obturator
- tibial. 

ankle 
- has med + collatral ligments 
- ant/post = tibiofibular ligaments
medial side - deltoid ligament : all have these parts: very strong 
- posterior tibiotalar fibers
- tibiocalcaneal fibers
- tibionavicular fibers
- anterior tibiotalar fibers 

lateral collateral ligaments = named from bone. of foot to the fibula 
- anterior talofibular ligament = these are most often torn 
- posterior talofibular ligament
- calcaneofibular ligament 

movement at ankle- flexion and extension only 
subtalar joint - 
- synovial glding bt inf and arteriolar surface of talus + superior articular surfaces of calcaneum 
- inversion + eversion 
midtarsal or transverse joint = talocalcaneonavicular + calcaneocuboid joints 
midtarsal /transverse joint are repsonsible for full eversion + inversion 


trochanteric bursitis - bc the gluteus max will get bumped and then can spread this inflammation up commonly associated  = very persistent 

iliotibial band syndrome - with runining, etc continual rubbing of band over lat femoral epicondyle => inflammation 

stress fractures in hip are common in running 

unhappy triad
- tackle made to lateral collateral portion 
- anterior cruciate ligament
- medial collateral ligament 
- meniscus too 
- lateral colalteral not impacted in spite of impact here, but the otehr side the medial collateral would open up 

knee joint injury = 
- chondromalacia patella - runniers knee. kneecap pain 
- due to kneecap rubbing against 1 side of knee joint + irritation 
- rest + PT. but sometimes lateral reslease can be invovled, cutting tight lateral ligaments. 

high ankle sprain 
- foot forced to rotate to outside, can be put in cast or screw can be put in if injury unstable to hold tibia + fibula in place
inversion injury - most common ankle sprain where ankle rolls out and foot inwars = tear of ligaments outside
less common = eversion injury, other way around and ligament on medial side dmg's
