and extrinsic muscles of the foot - things that go into it 
look at and project the surface anatomy 

tibia - large **medial bone = weight bearing bone of leg**
- large upper end, smaller distal end. 
- proximal: articulate with condyles of femur + head of fibula and distally with **talus** and fibula 
- medial end = medial malleolus , like it sticks down a little
- medial+lat condyles = plateau
- intercondylar eminence with intercondylar tubercles
- there's tibial tuberosity (front, for ligament of patella) + gerdy's tubercle (attachment pt for tentiae fascia lata)
- soleal line = on the posterior surface for the soleus muscle 
- look into: emdial, lateral, posterior surfaces,.... and anterior, interosseous, and medial borders

fibula - smaller slender lateral , 
- no body weight transmission , but support 
- prox end = head + neck 
- distal end = lateral malleolus 
- this **projects further distally/down than the medial one, articulating medially with the talus**
- - look into: medial, lateral, posterior surfaces;; and anterior, interosseous, and medial borders

for both bones, posterior and anterior intercndylar areas = have intercondylar tubercles
ant/post ligaments of head of fibula are associated 
distally, there's ant/post ligaments which will attach the 2 bones together

bones of foot
- talus, calcaneus, navicular(boat shaped), cuboid(boat shaped), 3 cuneiforms, 5 set of metatarsal bones + associated phalanges
- also got sesamoid bones on the great toe on the inferior surface = these are to facilitate movements + give structure. 
important feat of the talus
- head
- neck
- trochlea
- lat/post processes 
- groove for flexor hallucis longus tendon between the lateral and posterior processes 
	- hallucis = great toe tendon attachment 

foot arches: 3 of these
- medial longitudinal arch = calcaneus - like the ball of the foot in the back, talus (keystone, connects the fibula/tibia with foot), navicular- squishy and medial, 3 cuneiforms- medial, intermediate, lateral + medial 3 metatarsal bones 
- lateral longitudinal arch = calcaneus, cuboid (keystone, large and rectangular and latera), and 4/5th metatarsal bones 
- transverse arch = bases of metatarsal bones, cuboid + 3 cuneiforms = mid point of foot , down the middle 
arches allow us to walk on uneven surfaces and round surfaces!!!! 

compartments
- crural fascia = will attach ant and medial borders of tibia = they are tight 
- anterior + posterior crural intermuscular septa + interosseous memb divide into compartments: 
	- anterior
	- latera
	- posterior 
		- also a deep transverse septum that splits posterior into posterior deep and superficial 
movements
extension = dorsiflexion 
flexion = plantarflexion 
inversion = rotation of foot into the medial side 
eversion - rotation of foot out to the lateral side 

anterior compartment
1. tibialis anterior
2. extensor digitorum longus
3. extensor hallucis longus 
4. fibularis (peroneus) tertius muscle 
blood supply all with **anterior tibial artery**
nerve supply = all with deep fibular/peroneal nerve
