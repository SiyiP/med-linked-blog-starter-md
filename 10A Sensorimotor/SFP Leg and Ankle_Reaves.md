and extrinsic muscles of the foot - things that go into it 
look at and project the surface anatomy 

tibia - large **medial bone = weight bearing bone of leg**
- large upper end, smaller distal end. 
- proximal: articulate with condyles of femur + head of fibula and distally with **talus** and fibula 
- medial end = medial malleolus , like it sticks down a little
- medial+lat condyles = plateau
- intercondylar eminence with intercondylar tubercles
- there's tibial tuberosity (front, for ligament of patella) + gerdy's tubercle (attachment pt for tentiae fascia lata)
- soleal line = on the posterior surface for the soleus muscle 
- look into: emdial, lateral, posterior surfaces,.... and anterior, interosseous, and medial borders

fibula - smaller slender lateral , 
- no body weight transmission , but support 
- prox end = head + neck 
- distal end = lateral malleolus 
- this **projects further distally/down than the medial one, articulating medially with the talus**
- - look into: medial, lateral, posterior surfaces;; and anterior, interosseous, and medial borders

for both bones, posterior and anterior intercndylar areas = have intercondylar tubercles
ant/post ligaments of head of fibula are associated 
distally, there's ant/post ligaments which will attach the 2 bones together

bones of foot
- talus, calcaneus, navicular(boat shaped), cuboid(boat shaped), 3 cuneiforms, 5 set of metatarsal bones + associated phalanges
- also got sesamoid bones on the great toe on the inferior surface = these are to facilitate movements + give structure. 
important feat of the talus
- head
- neck
- trochlea
- lat/post processes 
- groove for flexor hallucis longus tendon between the lateral and posterior processes 
	- hallucis = great toe tendon attachment 

foot arches: 3 of these
- medial longitudinal arch = calcaneus - like the ball of the foot in the back, talus (keystone, connects the fibula/tibia with foot), navicular- squishy and medial, 3 cuneiforms- medial, intermediate, lateral + medial 3 metatarsal bones 
- lateral longitudinal arch = calcaneus, cuboid (keystone, large and rectangular and latera), and 4/5th metatarsal bones 
- transverse arch = bases of metatarsal bones, cuboid + 3 cuneiforms = mid point of foot , down the middle 
arches allow us to walk on uneven surfaces and round surfaces!!!! 

compartments
- crural fascia = will attach ant and medial borders of tibia = they are tight 
- anterior + posterior crural intermuscular septa + interosseous memb divide into compartments: 
	- anterior
	- latera
	- posterior 
		- also a deep transverse septum that splits posterior into posterior deep and superficial 
movements
extension = dorsiflexion 
flexion = plantarflexion 
inversion = rotation of foot into the medial side 
eversion - rotation of foot out to the lateral side 

anterior compartment
1. tibialis anterior - from
	1. from lateral surface of tibia + interosseus membrane
	2. insert into medial cuneiform and base of 1st metatarsal bone 
	3. extends foot at ankle, inverts food + helps hold up **medial longitudinal arch**
2. extensor digitorum longus
	1. from upper anterior part of fibula z= interosseuous membrane
	2. insert into base of mid phalanx + distal phalanx of 2nd - 5th toes
	3. extends toes + helps extend foot at ankle 
3. extensor hallucis longus 
	1. from middle half of anterior surface of fibula + from interosseous membrane
	2. insert into base of distal phalanx of big toe 
	3. extends great toe + contributes to foot extension at ankle. also inversion of feet 
4. fibularis (peroneus) tertius muscle 
	1. very small; from lower 1/3 of anterior surface of fibula
	2. insert into: dorsal aspect of base of 5th metatarsal 
	3. extends foooot at ankle + eversion of foot (bc lateral insertion point)
blood supply all with **anterior tibial artery**
	branch of the popliteal artery , which will pass thru the tibialis posterior, down medial to the fibula + under tibialis anterior 
	then lies at ankle bt 2 malleoli and continues on dorsum of foot as dorsalis pedis artery 
		- branches are anterior tibial recurrent a 
		- anterior medial malleolar arteries 
		- lateral malleolar arteries 
nerve supply = all with deep fibular/peroneal nerve
- basically psiatic nerve -> tibial. + common fibular 
	- common fibular divides into superficial and deep br 
	- common fibular n = will run down medial border o biceps femoris, cross over lateral head of gastrocnemius(where u find it), passes around neck of fibula + pierce fibularis longus to divide .... 
	- deep fibular n enters anterior by piercing anterior intermuscular septum 

lateral compartment 
1. fibularis longus 
	1. from superior 2/3 of lateral surface of fibula insertion into
	2. inferior surface of medial cuneiform + base of first metatarsal bone 
	3. **flex foot at ankle joint + everts the foot...** - bc it pulls up from under the foot, and inserts across the feet to travel to the first toe.  
	4. will pass behind lateral malleolus and then under superior + inf fibular retinacula... all the way under the foot 
		1. tendon **will pass under sole of foot** to insert into the point ... like medial cuneiform + base of the 1st metatarsal. 
		2. helps hold up the lateral longitudinal and transverse arches of feet. 
2. fibularis brevis
	1. shorter, from the 2/3 lower lateral surface of fibula, running downwrd behind lateral malleolus but anterior to fibularis longus
	2. insert into base of 5th metatarsal bone/tubercle/tuberosity
	3. flex foot at ankle and everts foot too 
supplied by fibular artery 
- posterior tibial artery branch = fibular artery which will come from the posterior and pierce the septum , going thru the posterior intermuscular septum to supply both muscles in lateral compartment
nerve = superficial fibular nerve 
- from the br. of the common fibular nerve. 
- arises in **fibularis longus muslce and emerges bt fibularis longus + brevis**
- become cutaneous in the **lower anterolateral aspect of the leg, in dorsolateral portion of foot**
- on the other side: deep fibular nerve = becomes cutaneous in the webspace of the first toe, and the rest of the cutaneous webspaces are innervated by the superficial fibular nerve 

posterior compartment
superior
1. medial + lat gastrocnemius
	1. lateral aspe of lat and med condyle 
	2. fused wiht the **tendo calcaneus to insert on the calcaneum**
	3. powerful flexor of foot and even contributes to knee flexion!!!
	4. **note -this passes over both the knee joint and the foot joint so there's serious issues which can arise from the tendon stretching or getting fucked over**
2. plantaris = don't need it as much , but this is something that can also be used in transplants and tendon for reconstructive surgery 
	1. from lateral supracondylar ridge of femur, very skinny and small
	2. insertion into medial side of tendo calcaneus, 
	3. weak flexor of foot at the ankle 
3. soleus- soleal line is an attachment point for it 
	1. from soleal line of tibia and from upper 1/4 of the fibula 
	2. joins on its anterior part of tendo calcaneus 
	3. very powerful flexor of foot at the ankle , works with the gastrocnemius just without the damage risk 

deep
1. popliteus - 
	1. origin - lateral surface of lateral condyle of femur, with attachment on lateral meniscus 
	2. inserts on upper posterior surface of the tibia 
	3. **medial rotator of tibia on femur, unlocking the knee... this helps you walk properly** a bit of a flexor too... 
	4. the shifting that would take place makes walking start smoothly ... 
2. flexor hallucis longus - big toe 
	1. from middle 1/2 of posterior surface of fibula
	2. insertion into base of distal phalanx of great toe
	3. flex big toe distal phalanx, the foot at the ankle, and supports the medial longitudinal arch 
3. flexor digitorum longus - 
	1. from middle half of the posterior surfac of tibia
	2. insert into distal phalanges of lateral 4 toes
	3. flex foot at ankle and support BOTH medial + lateral longitudinal arches of foot 
4. tibialis posterior - opposite of tibialis anterior 
	1. from mid posterior surfaces of both shaft of tibia. + fibula + interosseous membrane
	2. insertion into tuberosity of navicular + neighbor bones
	3. flexes foot at ankle and inverts the foot and supports medial longitudinal arch of foot bc it's on the medial end ... might see difference in it in cadavers in insertion point 
	4. **note - tibialis posterior tendon = will pass under sole to insert on the navicular neighboring bones** 
supply: posterior tibial artery
- this is a terminal br of the popliteal artery , beginning at lower border of popliteus 
- courses medially in posterior compartment, deep to gastrocnemius, soleus, and deep transverse fascia. 
- distaly will divide into 2 terminal br = medial and latral plantar arteries **to supply foot**
nerve = tibial nerve 
- will descend with posterior tibial vessels, deep to gastrocnemius and soleus muscles
- divide distaly into medial + lateral plantar nerves 
- articular br to ankle joint + muscular br to this compartment 

talus + calcaenus attaching ligament = flexor retinaculum 

extensor retinaculum
ankle - uniaxial synovial joint = bt the talus + lower end of tibia + fibula
allows fo r the movement of tendons that infiltrate the dorsum 
- deep fascia will thicken to make superior + inferior extensor retinacula 
deep to it: 
- tibialis anterior tendon
- anterior tibial a 
- deep fibular n
- extensor hallucis longus tendon 
- extensor digitorum longus tendon 
- fibularis tertius muscle 
NOT under it at all: 
- great saphenous vein (anastamose with dorsal venous arch of foot)
- the superfiical fibular n which becomes cutaneous at the foot 

medial aspect of ankle under the flexor retinaculum ; TDANH - tom dick and nervous harry 
- tibialis posterior tendon
- flexor digitorum longus 
- posterior tibial artery (can be palpate here)
- tibial n 
- flexor hallucis longus tendon 

fibular retinacula - ths is a superir fibular retinaculum which goes from lateral malleolus to calcaneus with inf fibular retinaculum on the calcaneus blending with deep fascia 
- fibularis longus + brevis pass under and are able to move. 
- superficial to this is sural nerve + small saphenous vein 
- this is a very small CT sheath on the sides and lateral and diagnoal... 

----
clinical info 
common fibular nerve 
- travels right around the head of the fibula, which is the bone, and this causes issues at injury 
- basically deep fibular nerve = allows for extension 
- you can't extend ... if that nerve's dmg, you get a **foot drop - inability to dorsiflex**
- they overcompensate and lift their foot high. 
- where's the injury?
	- deep fibular n - if broken can't extend 
	- superfibular nerve - if broken can't flex foot
