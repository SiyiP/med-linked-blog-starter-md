bones
- pelvis and femur 
- femur = will articulate with tibia, this is the weight bearing bone of the body; no articulation of this with fibula 

gluteal region 
deep group 
- piriformis
	- sciatic nerve
- superior gemellus - nerve to obturator internus 
- obturator internus 
- inf gemellus -  nerve to quadratus femoris  
- quadratus femoris - nerve to quadratus femoris 
all for lateral rotation of femur at hip joint 

superficial grp
- gluteus max - inf gluteal n, superior AND inferior gluteal arteries 
- med - sup + inf gluteal arteries + sup gluteal n 
- minimus - sup + inf gluteal arteries + sup gluteal n 
- tensor fascia lata 
for abduction + extension at hip joint 


strongest intermuscular septa of the thigh 
- lateral intermuscular septum - gonna be pinned, and immediately dep would be vastus lateralis 

anterior compartment of thigh 
- for flexion of thigh @ hip
- extension of leg at knee joint
5 muscles 
- acting on hip joint = 
	- iliacus 
	- psoas major
	- pectineus (adduct, should be in medial but bc of innervation it's here)
- on hip and knee joint = 
	- sartorius 
	- rectus femoris 
- knee joint only: 
	- vastus medialis
	- vastus intermedius 
	- vastus lateralis 
- ==innervated by the: femoral nerve==
	- enters into thigh deep to inguinal ligament, 
	- gives motor innervation with anterior compartment of thigh 
	- **cutaneously gives to anterior thigh, medial knee, leg, ankle, foot** 
		- 2 br. of this nerve going thru adductor or subsartorial canal:
		- nerve to vastus medialis - will peel out of the space 
		- saphenous nerve - **doesn't go thru adductor hiatus, but behind the vastoadductor membrane, where it will go into popliteal fossa and split**
- ==supplied by the **profunda femoris artery**==

femoral artery 
- first br of it in the femoral triangle: profunda femoris a 
	- br of profunda femoris: 
	- medial circumflex femoral a 
		- retinacular aa is a br off this
	- lateral circumflex femoral a 
	- perforating br (4) into the adductor magnus 
where does femoral a become popliteal a?
	- in adductor hiatus of adductor magnus 
- popliteal a , inferior to popliteus muscle or just deep to the arc of soleus muscle 
	- anterior tibial a
	- posterior tibial a 

medial compartment of thigh 
- adduction of thigh at hip 
- gracilis lateral
- adductor longus 
- adductor brevis 
	- more medial portion = hamstring part , has a tendon 
	- adductor part is more muscular
- obturator externus near the top. 
nerve innervation 
- obturator nerve will go into the obturator canal and enter the  wall 
	- this does have some cutaneous action 
- **hamstring part is innervated by tibial nerve!!!**
arteries:
- obturator a 
- ==profunda femoris a== 
	- ==medial circumflex femoral a picks up the compartment before anastamosing with the lateral circumflex femoral a on the neck and head of femur== 

posterior compartment of thigh 
- rotation and flexion of leg at knee joint 
- extension of thigh at hip joint 
- biceps femoris = long head is under? 
- semitendinosus = pes ancerinus 
- semimembranosus 
innervated by sciatic, mainly the **tibial n except for the common fibular on the short head of biceps**
- inf to piriformis 
- run deep to long head of biceps femoris + on top of the adductor magnus
- tibial n = everything else in this department AND the **hamstrings portion of adductor brevis** from medial compartment 
- common fibular n = short head of short head 
supplied blood = perforating aa of profunda femoris a 

leg 
deep fascia of leg = crural fascia , continuous with fascia lata of thigh . -> will thicekn to make extensor retinacula 
- anterior compartment = dorsiflex+extension of toes 
	- tibialis anterior 
	- extensor hallucis longus 
	- extensor digitorum longus 
	- fibularis TERTIUS (also everter)
	- innervated by deep fibular nerve of common fibular 
	- blood from anterior tibial a (from popliteal a as it becomes a real artery)
		- becomes dorsalis pedis at the ankle joint 
- lateral = foot everters + helps with some plantarflexion
	- fibularis longus = headed to the medial cuneiform at the 1st metatarsal, reinforcing that ARCH
	- fibularis brevis = headed to the fiffth metatarsal, simiar to the fibularis tertius 
	- nerve = superficial fibular nerve bt brevis and longus 
	- ==blood supply = br of fibular artery, which **comes from the split between posterior tibial a and fibular artery**==
	- common fibular nerve will divide into 
		- ==lateral sural cutaneous nerve in popliteal fossa -> supplies to lateral leg== 
			- supplies skin of lateral aspect of leg 
		- then it will **wrap around neck of fibula = this is common site of injury** = at the neck divides into 
			- superficial fibular n = supply lateral **motor**, skin on distal 1/3 of anterior surface of leg + MAJORITY of dorsal foot skin 
			- deep fibular n = supply anterior **motor and really the motor for intrinsic dorsal muscles of foot**, skin in first web space bt great toe + 2nd digit
				- motor for extensor hallucis brevis and extensor digitorum brevis 
- posterior = plantarflexor + flex toes 
	- superficial 
		- gastrocnemius with medial. + lateral head
			- superior genicular aa above the head 
		- soleus 
		- plantaris = little baby up top 
	- deep 
		- popliteus
		- flexor hallucis longus 
		- flexor digitorum longus 
		- tibialis posterior 
	- nerve: the tibial n = motor for all muscles on posterior thigh except short head of biceps femoris, and all of posterior leg and all **intrinsic foot muscles except extensor hallucis brevis/extensor digitorum brevis**
		- will pass thru posterior thigh + popliteal fossa
		- gives rise to **sural nerve/medial cutaneous sural nerve** = travels down with the **small saphenous vein**, then will pass thru soleus and then thru tarsal tunnel posterior to the medial malleolus -> to enter **plantar aspect of foot**
			- **giving rise to medial and lateral plantar nerve** 
			- medial + lateral platnars will supply sensory info to the medial + lateral plantar of foot ; also motor innervation accordingly 
			- calcaneal brs = of heel cutaneous 
			- cutaneous sensory of the very medial of feet palmar = saphenous n 
			- of very lateral of feet palmar  = sural n 
	- blood - posterior tibial a = from the division of the popliteal a into the ant/post tibial

tarsal tunnel - passage of tendons of **deep posterior comartment**
- between calcenus bone and the rest of the foot ; all posterior to the medial malleolus 
anterior to posterior = orientation at the tunnel, not at the leg. 
- tom  - tibialis posterior 
- dicked =- flexor digitorum longus 
- a - posterior tibial Artery 
- very - posterior tibial Vein 
- nervous - tibial N (sometimes it'll divide before getting to that space)
- harry - flexor hallucis longus 

knee joint 2 articular surfaces
- 2 femoral condyles - articulation, flat with full extension with tibial contyles ,, in flexion they're curved 
- 2 tibial condyles 
- menisci = c shaped cartilages = medial and lateral, responsible for accomodating any changes in shape in any movements. 
	- medial = attached around margin to joint capsule , and to **tibial collateral ligament so any dmg here would dmg this medial meniscus**
	- lateral meniscus = no attachment to capsule so more mobile 
collateral ligaments in supporting hinge movements of knee
- fibular collateral ligament - cord like, superiorly to lateral femoral epicondyl and attach inferior to lateral surfac of fibular head, not the lateral meniscus
- tibial collateral lig = broad flat, attach to medial femoral epicondyle and then the medial condyle of tibia + tibial shaft and the medial meniscus 
- **crossed by the sartorius, gracilis and semitendonis tendons**
cruciate = intracapsular ligaments connecting femur + tibia 
- anterior cruciate ligament - at the tibial plateau, attaches on ant part of intercondylar area of tibia, ascending posteriorly to attach to posterior part of medial surface of lateral femoral condyele
	- this prevents anterir displacement of tibia relative to femur
- posterior cruciate lig = posterio aspect of intercondylar area of tibia, like a cross... and will ascend anteriorly to attach to lateral side of medial ffemoral contdyle 
	- restrict poterior displacement 

cases
avascular necrosis to femoral head + neck 
- l leg shortened + laterally rotated 
- thinking of arteries disrupted being the **medial circumflex a -> gives rise to retinacular a** 
- recall it's a br of femoris profunda 
acetbular br of obturator a ? - it is on head to femur, but it's not enough to supply blood alone 

lateral strike to right leg during motor collision 
- fracture on prox fibula
- can't dorsiflex or evert right foot
- toes drag on ground
- lifts knee igher than normal 
- dorsum of right foot sensation dec 
- **common fibular nerve** = also huge for sensation on the dorsal foot 
	- loss of dorsiflexing = anterior compartment, the reason why it's not just superficia fibular nerve... 
		- **footdrop!!! exascerbated by unopposed inversion of foot with tibialis *posterior* bc tibialis anterior is not there**
	- eversion = lateral ; f it was just this it would just be the superficial fibular n 

case 3 
small saphenous v harvested from right leg for grafting
- post op tingling along distal posterolateral aspect of leg + lateral side of his foot 
- dec cutaneous sensatin, but motor function completely chill 
- sural nerve damaged!!! - a branch of the tibial nerve
