med imging of lower extremity 
hip and pelvis 
- prox femoral fractures common in elderly 
- osseous pelvic ring - origins and insertions? 
![[pelvis xray.png|432x313]]
1. sacrum
2. sacroiliac joint 
3. iliac bone 
4. ischium 
5. pubis 
6. pubic symphysis 
7. femoral head 
8. greater trochanter 
9. lesser trochanter
10. acetabulum 
11. obturator foramen 
12. greater sciatic notch 

tendon/muscle origins 
ASIS to leg bone = sartorius 
ischial tubrosity = the hamstring origin 
AIIS = origin for the rectus femoris 
gluteus medius tendon - posterior aspect of iliac wing to the greater trochanter (similar to the minimus insertion point but not the maximus)

satrorius avulsion fracture
- more common be4 apophyseal usion, in kids. 
- small boney fragment seen adjacent to the ASIS, the bone off the xray slightly popping out. 
pelvic ring fracture
- multispot fractures, a vertical shear injury, some offset parts of the ring seen in the severe injury 
ring fracture in lower extremity 
- interosseus membrane of leg, seen where we see widening of the medial clear space of the tibiatalar joint, so we need to look for **ligamental injury**

proximal femur fracture
- where a linear defect is seen, displacement of lesser trochanteric fragment 
- also neck to shaft angle is different seen . 
- radiographically occult femoral neck fracture = like 10% of ppl - CT and MRIs are like 98-100% sensitive ofc 
hip = very good sight with MRI
- T2 fat signal will be knockd out, edema/fluid is very bright don't forget 

treatment of hip fractures
- dynamic hip screw - the screw lets impaction where the fracutre is, and promotes te healing typically for extracapsular fractures
- cephalomedullary nail - faster, cost effective, more stable
- hemiartroplasty - prevention of avascular necrosiS!!!

avascular necrosis
- trauma is most common cause
- slerosis + lucency eventually with bone collapse
- ultimate treat = hip joint replacement
- other causes : SATS: steroids, alcohol, trauma, sickle cell dz 
- in addition ,you get it via legg-calve-perhes dz and gaucher's disease
- more than 50% bilateral
- most ppl get it are <50 yrs

slipped capital femoral epiphysis or sciffy
- 10-15 yo
- epithysis will slip off from femoral neck... offset exagerrated
- ice cream ball falling outta bone
- 25% bilatera, boy>girl, obesity 

knee
![[knee xray.png]]
roof of intercondylar notch = notch bt the condyles of the knee

**anterior cruciate ligament = primary stabilization of knee to do tibial translation **
- goes from inner aspect of the lateral femoral condyle to the tibial spines/intercondylar eminence
- ACL
MCL = from middle femoral condyle to the medial tibia  
LCL - lateral collateral ligament from the lat condyle to insert on lateral aspect of the fibular head
- will joint to maek the conjoint tendon, which will go down to maek the biceps femoris 

quadriceps + patellar tendon '
- quads all make 1 tendon seen on MRI 
- patella from patella to tibia 
- works well to look at ultrasound 
- patellar tnedon 
	- bright with dark shadowing = a bone. and a striated white structure going from this bone = the tendon 


knee
- 3 articular surfaces
- collateral ligs, menisci, cartilage 

there's some fluid density in the patellar space with a straight line
- on x ray - there's a fat fluid level, meaning a fracture. so getCT
	- we get this bc the marrow elements have fat in them, so with rupture comes fat fluid pile ups 
- bony fragmnt will be seen and a faracture line can be seen 

prepatellar bursitis
- repetitive pressure on these ... meaning the subcutaneous tissue overlying patelal, very bright fluid collection , patellar tension deep into this

backer's cyst - / popliteal fossa cyst
- normal distension of posterior joint absess
- **extends bt the semimembranous and the gastrocnemius tendon** 
- association with joint iffusion 

when u get an ACL tear, u get anterior tibial displacement and weird angle on pcl 
you get ACL tear along with a medial meniscus and MCL tear = **unahppy triad**

mri of knee = **for meniscus and cartilage injury**
- torn meniscus should show up as white space between the knee bones... usually normal knee joint meniscus shows up as dark unused space 

**alternatives/equivalnns of fibrocartilage in knee like knee meniscus but with other things**
- glenoid labrum  of shoulder
- acetabular labrum of the hips 
- triangular ibrocartilage complex of writst 

foot + ankle 
- malleolar fractures common 
- flexor + extensor tendons, medial/lat ligaments at ankle 
- complex midfoot anatomy - **lis franc injury**
![[ankle xray.png]]
ligaments named after bone articulation 

distal fibula's lateral malleolus to the talus = talofibular ligament anterior TFL= **most commonly torn ligament in ankle, an inversion injury**
	typically we have a **lateral sag in injury or fracture of latral**
anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament ATFL . 
deltoid ligament - medial malleolus to the talus = has a superficial + deep components..? 
- **note - if you xray and see only a medial injury and nothing else, get more imagine to see the proximal leg since it's a ring and impact can travel up**

achilles tendon - makes with the gastro muscles

tom dick and very nervous harry 
- structures of posterior medial ankle 
- tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, artery, vein, flexor hallucis longus = all flexor tedon. 
laterally we have the peroneal tendon - there's the peroneus longus 

ankletendon injury 
- posterior tibial tear. can see the posterior tibial tendn gunk coming in, and bc it holds up that midfoot arch can cause bad things 

feet

![[foot xray.png]]
- never miss this type f foot xray 
- the abnoram l one = lisfrank injury - teres some **widening at base of 2nd and 1st bmetatarsals **
- very serious injury,  a lot of the lisfranke ijury = moral. 
in here, with the shifting ofall the metatarsals - fracture of midfoot lisfrank severe 
- dorsal metatarsal offset 

peroneus brevis avulsion fracture - inerted ur ankle, causing that slight bone to pop out at the base of the 5th metatarsla 

bone lesions 
- avascular necrosis = common in hip 
- slipped capital femoral epiphysis in kids/adolescents
- osteosarcoma - most common malignancy primary bone tumor <30 yo 
	- production of osteoid matrix, white dense clouds around 
	- most common of adolescence, 12-30 yo malignant
	- aggro with ill defined mineralization , periosteal rxn and bone deestruction
- ewing sarcoma  - with no osteoid formation - more 5-10 yo, loose and permentative
- giant cell tumor 20-30 - less aggressive nonmalignant without osteoid formation 
- osteoid osteoma - benign w/ nidus 
	- cortical bone lesion with central nidus
	- typical vignette - night pain relieved by **NSAIDs**
	- seen cortical thickening adjacent to nidus, 
	- benign, pain resolution over 3-5 yrs
	- femur + spine = classic places -
	- TREAT: with ablation 
- osteochondroma/exostosis 
	- see bony growth from medial distal femoral metasphysis 
	- **cortical meduallary continuity** 
	- both bone and cartilage, cap made up of cartilage can't see on xray needs mri
	- very small risk of the caritlage cap degenerating into chondrosarcoma, malignant 
	- causes issues with structures nearby, nerve pains and vessel occlusion 
	- 15% = multiple hereditary exotoses = meaning an **outbreak of them everywehre** - so highly risk of malignancy of deneration
