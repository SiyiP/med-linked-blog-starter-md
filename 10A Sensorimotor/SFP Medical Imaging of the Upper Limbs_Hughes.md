imaging - so upload the pdf here 

radiographs - prj imging with source + detector 
- xray photons stopped = more white like with bone
- radiodensities = bone, soft tissue(gray), fat, gas (black)
MRI - H+ imaging, can differentiate: muscle, ligament, tendon, cartilage + detect signal changes = **edema/injury**
- **marrow fat = bright in T1** weightd 
- T2 weighted = fluids-sensitive(usually in the spine, CSF, bladder) , all the other fats are filtered out 

greater tuberosity = insetion point of supraspinatus 
subscapularis = insertion at the lesser tuberosity 
deltoid = insertion more further down deltoid tuberosity 

![[xray shoulder labeled.png]]
1. clavicle
2. ==**acromion**==
3. ==coracoid?== 
	1. coracoid process = great anterior landmark
4. ==scapula== - more whiteish, indicating bone 
5. ==spine of scapula== 
6. glenoid of scapula  
7. head of humerus 
8. greater tuberosity of humerus
9. lesser tuberosity of humerus 
dashed line = anatomical neck
dashed arrow = surgical neck - **most common fractures in proximal humerus, then the tuberosities**
bicipital groove bt tuberosities 

anterior axillary view - essential to view things in more angles to capture things ![[anterior axillary view shoulder xray.png]]
1. humeral head
2. ==glenoid==
3. ==coracoid== 
4. ==acromion==
5. distal clavicle 

xrays = are great for bones in vizualization more than the MRI (typically like marrow or something)
- so if things are closer to one another xrays usually better 
- MRI = better contrast bt tissues , see muscles + tendons ![[mri shoulder diff views.png]]
1. coracoid process 
2. supraspinatus 
3. infraspinatous 
4. teres minor
5.  ==**subscapularis**==
6. ??? Labrum?? - not in pin list only mentioned once. 
7. long head of the bicepts = **on the bicipital groove of axial view**

AC joint separation - fracture of the clavicle offset , very common 
- so the coracoclavicular ligament also broken 
- we separate the fractures into proximal, distal , mid 
- distal = lateral to the coracoclavicular ligament = most common 

sternoclavicular dislocation = anterior and posterior
- anterior more common 
- posterior more worrisome bc the brachiocephalic, l common cephalic, and l subclavian arteries are right behind it, worry about great vessel injuries = also very hard to xray 
	- hard to tell anterior v posterior, just get CT to figure it out 

when u lose the tendon tear, we will lose that space bt the humeral head and the acromial head 
- consistent iwth **rotator cuff tear**

MRI of shoulder for rotator cuff tears
- **looking for fluid and absence of tendon**
- typically see edema which pops out in T2 MRIS
- also the type 1 collagen (usually veery organized) is gray/bright when torn rather than darker bc of that tear  

MRI of shoulder for labral tears - 
- same tear, but the labrum and it's more **gray/black hole but just bright fluid more down.**

just remember = tendons should be dark on t2 mri, but bright fluid otherwise ... 

you know a muscle is bad when it's surrounded by bright fluid or replaced by fat 
- think of nerve injury as a cause, esp when it's more fatty 

fibrocartilage meniscus like structures of joint that stabilize joint + distribute weight = if disrupted the joint gets unstable + you get arthritis
- same deal with bright t2 fluids 

anterior shoulder dislocation - common + seen in younger
- **humeral head is directed inferiorly bc of this, and *anteriorly* too**
- bc of this, axillary n dmg in quadrilateral region is possible 
- tldr teres minor impacted
