imaging - so upload the pdf here 

radiographs - prj imging with source + detector 
- xray photons stopped = more white like with bone
- radiodensities = bone, soft tissue(gray), fat, gas (black)
MRI - H+ imaging, can differentiate: muscle, ligament, tendon, cartilage + detect signal changes = **edema/injury**
- **marrow fat = bright in T1** weightd 
- T2 weighted = fluids-sensitive(usually in the spine, CSF, bladder) , all the other fats are filtered out 

greater tuberosity = insetion point of supraspinatus 
subscapularis = insertion at the lesser tuberosity 
deltoid = insertion more further down deltoid tuberosity 

![[xray shoulder labeled.png]]
1. clavicle
2. ==**acromion**==
3. ==coracoid?== 
	1. coracoid process = great anterior landmark
4. ==scapula== - more whiteish, indicating bone 
5. ==spine of scapula== 
6. glenoid of scapula  
7. head of humerus 
8. greater tuberosity of humerus
9. lesser tuberosity of humerus 
dashed line = anatomical neck
dashed arrow = surgical neck - **most common fractures in proximal humerus, then the tuberosities**
bicipital groove bt tuberosities 

anterior axillary view - essential to view things in more angles to capture things ![[anterior axillary view shoulder xray.png]]
1. humeral head
2. ==glenoid==
3. ==coracoid== 
4. ==acromion==
5. distal clavicle 

xrays = are great for bones in vizualization more than the MRI (typically like marrow or something)
- so if things are closer to one another xrays usually better 
- MRI = better contrast bt tissues , see muscles + tendons ![[mri shoulder diff views.png]]
1. coracoid process 
2. supraspinatus 
3. infraspinatous 
4. teres minor
5.  ==**subscapularis**==
6. ??? Labrum?? - not in pin list only mentioned once. 
7. long head of the bicepts = **on the bicipital groove of axial view**

AC joint separation - fracture of the clavicle offset , very common 
- so the coracoclavicular ligament also broken 
- we separate the fractures into proximal, distal , mid 
- distal = lateral to the coracoclavicular ligament = most common 

sternoclavicular dislocation = anterior and posterior
- anterior more common 
- posterior more worrisome bc the brachiocephalic, l common cephalic, and l subclavian arteries are right behind it, worry about great vessel injuries = also very hard to xray 
	- hard to tell anterior v posterior, just get CT to figure it out 

when u lose the tendon tear, we will lose that space bt the humeral head and the acromial head 
- consistent iwth **rotator cuff tear**

MRI of shoulder for rotator cuff tears
- **looking for fluid and absence of tendon**
- typically see edema which pops out in T2 MRIS
- also the type 1 collagen (usually veery organized) is gray/bright when torn rather than darker bc of that tear  

MRI of shoulder for labral tears - 
- same tear, but the labrum and it's more **gray/black hole but just bright fluid more down.**

just remember = tendons should be dark on t2 mri, but bright fluid otherwise ... 

you know a muscle is bad when it's surrounded by bright fluid or replaced by fat 
- think of nerve injury as a cause, esp when it's more fatty 

fibrocartilage meniscus like structures of joint that stabilize joint + distribute weight = if disrupted the joint gets unstable + you get arthritis
- same deal with bright t2 fluids 

anterior shoulder dislocation - common + seen in younger
- **humeral head is directed inferiorly bc of this, and *anteriorly* too**
- bc of this, axillary n dmg in quadrilateral region is possible 
- tldr teres minor impacted

![[elbow xray ap.png]]

1. radial head 
2. ==capatiellum== 
3. trochlea  of distal humerus 
4. ==olecranon  = thick, large , curved bony procss on proximal posterior end of ulna== 
5. ==olecranon fossa of distal humerus (see that dark space?)==
6. medial epicondyle 
7. lateral epicondyl 
8. ==proximal radial ulnar joint==
9. ==radial/bicipital tuberosity== 

![[elbow anatomy lateral xray.png|293x322]]
1. radial head 
2. **coronoid process of ulna **
3. trochlea of distal humerus 
4. olecranon process of prox ulna  
5. olecranon fossa
6. coronoid fossa 


elbow joint effusion after trauma
- **fat density is darker than soft tissue and darker than bone.... so there's fat inside the joint capsule, the synovium. all fluid is deep to the joint**
- posterior fat sign = usually there, probable fracture. 
- sail's sign = rounded water density pushing that normal fat out , making a triangular sail = fat of coronoid fossa 
- sign of adult trauma - radial head fracture = not seen in xray, just mobiliize and stuff and act like it's a fracture 

![[forearm xray ap.png|111x285]]
1. radius
2. ulna 
3. ==radiocapitellar joint==
4. ==ulnar trochlear joint== 
5. distal radio ulnal joint 
6. radiocarpal joint
7. carpal bones
we many boney rings - in joints and boney joints 
- every time you see a bony ring - there's 2 fractures, fractures going thru 2 bones like the radius + ulna 


special things in children 
 - cartilaginous physis = softer things of epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis = 
 - weakest area of bones
 - torus fracture = bones bending/buckling 
 - incomplete fractures liek greenstick fractures easily 
 - the physis or apophysis may fail be4 bone = physis are weak points!!! know this in peds. 

mri of elbow
- epicondylitis = usulaly pain on either side, we see radiologically brighter parts
- typically tendons inserting on the lateral side of the distal humerus 
	- **extensor tendons** - look at common extensor tendons 
	- radial collateral ligament and ulnar lateral collateral ligament too deep to the extensor insertions 
we might call it lateral/common extensor tendon tear = tennis elbow 

on the medial side = the ulnar collateral tendon's the only thing that inserts onto the medial epicondyle onto the coronoid procss
- ucl - typically brighter regularly, but injury = bright fluid. 
- this is a tommy johns procedure project

1. 1st metacarpal 
2. distal ulna 
3. ulnar styloid?
4. distal radius 
5. scaphoid 
6. lunate
7. triquetrium 
8. pisiform 
9. hamate 
10. hook of hamate
11. capitate
12. trapezoid 
13. trapezium 
use: 
- ==so long to pinky, here comes the thumb== 
starts from proximal row from scaphoid to the pinky, then the distal row from hamate to thumb 
abnormal - 
- younger pts = think scaphoid fracture with falling with outstretched hand, can be radial occult fracture. easy to miss in xray if they're nondislcated 
- common in older = think distal radius fracture with falling in outstretched hands

![[hand xray ap.png|174x286]]
1. CMC carpal metacarpal joint 
2. metacarpal 2nd one 
3. MCP joint metacarpal phalangeal 
4. proximal phalanx
5. PIP proximal interphalangeal 
6. middle phalanx 
7. DIP distal interphalangeal 
8. distal phalanx 
9. seasmoid of 1st phalangeal joint 
10. hook of hamate = recall it's an attachment pt ffor flexor tendons of ring + small fingers 

boxer's fracture = 
- fracture of 5th metacarpal- usually w anterior/radial angulation 
- can deal with some defformity 

osteoarthritis 
- sclerosis subchondrial - cartilage will be eaten away - seen cysts too 
- osteophytes= create productive bones along the margins "bone spurs" 
- nonuniform joint space **narrowing**
- productive without erosions 
- thumb base + DIPS; more distal changes 
RA
- joint marginal EROSIONS + **univorm** joint space narrowing
- Radiocarpal, distal radioulnar + mcp joints 
	- this is bc the first parts that are worn away are parts without cartilage (cartilage is on the margins)

carpal tunnel anatomy ![[carpal tunnel imaging ap.png]]
1. flexor retinaculum 
2. hook of hamate (flexor retinaculum will insert into this on ulnar side of hand.)
3. trapezium 
4. median n 
5. flexor digitorum superficialis tendon 
6. 5. flexor digitorum profundus tendon
7. **flexor pollicis longus tendon**
8. ulnar nerve and artery (outside)

back and spine [[SFP Deep Back, Vertebral Column, Spinal Cord_Visconti]]
cervical 
- wider transversely than anteriorly 
- triangular foramen 
- has **transverse foramen for vertebral artery**
- bifid spinous process
- facets more horizontal than vertical 

thoracic 
- heart body round canal 
- partial costal facet on posterior lat aspect of each body superiorly + inf articulatign with ribs 
- vertical facet joitns
- costal facet on transverse processs for rib articulations 

lumbar vert
parts interarticularis = area in bt
- larger than C/T spine 
- round shape on axial 
- triangular canal 
- long transverse process
-  no rib articulations/transverse foramina
- "wrapped facets... like gifts"= superior facet is posterior + medial, inferior is anterior + lateral 
- we might see a "scotty dog"
- 
![[lumbar scotty dog.png]]
"pars defect" = scotty dog neck fracture

disc protrusion 
- we might see black slipping thru 
- in bt L5/S1 presume it's a S1 issue
- otherwise lumbar disc herniations will freq compress the transversing nerve root like with l4/5 affecting the l5 nerve root
