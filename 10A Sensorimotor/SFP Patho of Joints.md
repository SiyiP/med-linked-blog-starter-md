joint function 
- utimately - movement + stability 
- solid joint / **synarthroses** = max stability, min movement like sternum ribs pelvis
- synovial joints = joint space filled with synovial fluid which is plasma rich substance with hyaluronic aicd
	- hyaline cartilage = shock absorbing wear resistant surface
	- **type A synoviocyte = specialized macrophag**
	- **type B synoviocyte= speicalize fibroblast secretes hyaluronic acid + protein**  
	- synovial membranes = made up of synoviocytes 
	- we can get synovial metaplasia around some areas to help the body out in wear and tear 

1. arthritis - inflammation of joint
	1. osteoarthritis = technically just a degenerative joint diseaese not inflammatory 
		1. articular catilage = **becomes** fibular
	2. clinical location: hips, knees, lumbar/cervical verte, PIP/DIP/MCP
	3. slow onset, exponential inc with age, **worse with use, morning stiffness, crepitus + ROM limits**
	4. TREAT: pain management with nsaids, intraarticular steroids, replaceement
	5. **chondrocytes proliferate due to less water int he matrix, then cleavage of the typ2 collagen fibers since it's wear and tear... we get soft cartilage and granularity. release of cytokines + macrophages.... and then to compensate and stabilize the joints, our body does osteophyte formation with BONE SPURS and subchondreal cysts!!!**
	6. this is clinical dx, no imgaing nor testing unless needed
	7. chondrocyte injury, matrix is soft and granular with the wear and tear of cartilage cap, and then cysts will form, eroding the cartilage away. 
![[arthritis cartilage waring.jpeg]] - we see loose bodies of fragments that have broken of and are hanging in the joint space. 
- granular pitted area and pits in the bone's surface anatomy head 
2. rheumatoid arthritis
	- autoimmune -> non-suppurative (no neutrophils) proliferative and inflammatory synovitis, **destruction of artiular cartilage and then ankylosis or joint fusion**
	- polyarticular symmetric inflammatory arthritis
	- MCP + PIP, wrist, ankles, elbows, knees
	- swollen warm painful 
	- 3-5th decade, W>M 
	- extraarticular finding s= skin nodules, CV manifestation, interstitial lung dz 
	- RF + anti-CCP antibodies are good lab tests but some are sero-negative
	- HLA-DR4 , infection and smoking are all risk factors 
	- TREAT: steroids, methotrexate, TNF antagonists
	- **autoimmune T helper cell response causes this all!!!!** 
3. seronegative spondyloarthropathies
	1. most common is ankylosing spondylitis
	2. **vertebral and sacroiliac involvement!! ankylosis of the spine**
	3. we see "bamboo spine, which is infussion of back and a bunch of noduls"
	4. **HLB-B27 association** 
	5. ligament attachment inflamation = **enthesitis**
	6. reactive arthritis can progress to this, seen in young adults who get GI/GU infections, oligoarticular and monoarticular... , going into knee and dactylitis and synovitis is common 
	7. dermatitis is very common 
	8. **t cell mediated autoimmune response**
4. septic/suppurative arthritis
	- infectious, typically caused by bacteria 
	- kids = h flu, s. aureus, GBS, common is hematogenous spread
	- adults = gonococcus - like septic arthritis, etc. 
	- immunodef, illness, joint trauma/chronic arhtritis, ivdu are all risk factors
	- **fever, leukocytosis, swelling/pain in joint**
	- typically **monoarticular**
	- joint aspiration - confirm dx and provide culture 
	- **direct / traumatic inoculation or hematogenous spread... rapid joint destruction + deformity, it happens so fast**

crystalline arthropathies - not particularly inflammatory but caused by deposits
1. gout - acute arthritis bc of uric crystals
	1. painful, great toe podagra, asymmetric monoarticular in acute arthritis = erythematous + warm 
	2. in chronic we see **bone erosion, loss of joint space, tophi which are rhematoid nodules similar**
	3. gouty nephropathy with uric acid stones
	4. RF: genetics, hyperuricemiaage, obesity, meds, etc. reduced excretion
	5. TREAT: lifesytle, anti-inflammatories, and xanthine oxidase
	6. hyperuricemia -> crystal depo -> **phagocytosis and neutrophil recruitment** -> these macrophages + neutrophis cause this joint dmg
	7. primary - due to reduced excretion 
	8. secondary cause =**meds like thiazides or conditions like tumor lysis syndrome + CKD**
	9. crystals are **long slender, feathery and will see yellow when polarized and suspended in alc**
	10. ==yellow, parallel crystals = gout== 
2. pseudogout - ca pyrophosphate crystal depo dz
	1. asymptomatic, acute, subactue, or chronic
	2. mono-polyarticular 
	3. big joints - knee, elbow, wrists, shoulder, ankles
	4. sporadic in older ppl 
	5. **autosomal dom mutation in pyrophosphate transport channel for more early onset**
	6. secondary causes can be joint dmg, **hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism DM**
	7. TREAT: only supportive ): 
	8. ==microscope shows **rhomboid blue in parallel crystals** in cartilage + meniscus, causing a phagocytic response and potential inflammation = purple calcified aggregates.==
	9. radiograph image = we see spread on imaging

tmor like stuff
1. ganglion cyst - "bible cysts bc if yu smack them they'll go down"
	1. 1-1.5 cm fluctuant mass near joint capsule or tnedon sheath = 
	2. cystic or myxoid **degeneration which is like a hole which contains the synovial fluid material, but does not communicate with joint, like it's. a fibrous THIN CAPSULE full of synovial fluid**
	3. TREAT: surgically, get it all out before it fills back again
	4. ==called pseudocyst bc no epithelial lining, just fibrous tissue with degenerative change==
2. diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor 
	1. pigmented villonodular synovitis PVNS is old name
	2. like a shrub or sea anemonae
	3. 3-5 decade with large joint = knee
	4. pain, lim ROM + swelling 
	5. **destructive + recurrent tumors.... synovium covered by  ==finger like projections and nodules that are pigmented wiht hemosiderin==**
		1. in microscope - we can see pigment laden macrophages and the synovial surface is finger like projections on the side. 
		2. foamy macrophages
		3. hemosiderin-laden macrophages
		4. epitheliod cells = are actual tumr cellls tere 
	6. TREAT: excision 
	7. caused by ==t(1;2) fusion of type VI colagen a-3 gene promoter with CSF1 = monocyte colony stimulating factor== ![[diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor.jpeg]]
3. localized tenoxynovial giant cell tumor
	1. "ppl calle them giant cell tumor tendon sheath"
	2. discrete and palpable nodule on **fingers attached to tendon sheath **
	3. in 3-5 decade
	4. TREAT: excision. =not as destructive or persistent as the other type 
	5. t(1;2) fusion of type VI collagen with a-3 gene promoter with CSF. = **the same mutation**
	6. very circumscribed, a small little marble instead of big glob with finger things
	7. giant cells = most common , with osteoclast-like ones , and just a few macrophges. more epitheliod cells 
	8. ![[localized tenosynovial giant cell tumor.jpeg]]
