environmental path + physical injury 
"more like terminology" - not difficult material 

"lesion on the skin" - 1 in and a 1/2 long, 1/2 inch deep into the skin 
- this is an incised wound. 
abrasion - a scrape
incised wound - sharp injury - a "cut" , longer across skin, and shallower 
stab wound - sharp injury , deep and not as long
laceration - **blunt trauma, striking the sking and making it split**

sharp force vs the blunt force trauma
- nerves severed with sharp, not a lot of dmg around the skin
- tissue bridge = vessels and nerves with tensile strength NOT split with the blunt force trauma - remaining and bridging the lesison **tissue bridging**
![[blunt v sharp trauma tissue bridging.jpeg]]

around the laceration. -see some abrasions + scrapes

abraded edges = laceration 

contusion = also blunt trauma -
- there's not a huge diff between **ecchymosis vs contusion**
- but ecchymosis can happen without trauma due to bleeding disorders
diff bt contusion vs hematoma
- hematoma takes up space in the lesion with blood; the skin **swellls**
- skin stays **flat** = **contusion**
periorbital hematomas = indirect trauma causing the bruising like with skull fractures in the skull. hemorrhage will track into the soft tissue in eyes 

blunt trauma - seen in motor vehicle crashes
cases
- driver restrained with seat belt and hit van head on at a speed of 65 mph and dies on the scene 
- driver had no functioning airbag ): 
- cause of death = **aortic tear!** - 
1. aortic tear = very classical injury!
	- high speed motor vehicle crashes
	- **this is a deceleration injury = going high speed then an immediate stop**
	- ligamentum arteriosum will be tethering these organs as they move forward
	- ductus arteriosum tethers the aorta = **has a tendency to tear or transcect.**
- seatbelt marks on the person's chest is seen. **abrasions are seen.** 

marks on the side of his face = **glass from the side windows**
- the side windows = **made of tempered glass which is meant to break into small cubes instead of long sharp glass => giving the safer alternative dicing injury**
- angulated cuts!!! will be seen on the side of his face and the side of someone's body 

front windshield is meant to **spiderweb, and not break instead**

legs seen - injuries show fractures![[blunt injury pedestrian.jpeg|235x276]]
bumper of a vehicle has struck him, and one leg is higher than the other while walking, shows that he was walking when this happened 

pedestrian vs vehicle 
- adults are hit below center o gravity  = flipped onto hood and then off = **head and neck truauma**
- kids hit above center of gravity = run over ) : 
1. atlanto occipital separation ![[atlanto oxipital dislocation.jpeg|165x231]]
	- common fatal head and neck injury 

burns - 
- full thickness burn would require skin grafting
- partial thickness - even with these, more than 50% of the TBSA is burnt is fatal. 
	- 1st and 2nd degree, going down into the epidermis and or superficial dermis = very very painful + blisters
- full thickness would be 3-4th degree
	- loss of epidermis and dermis
	- **destroys dermal appendages so you need skin grafting**
	- white/charred, anesthetic (nerve destruction)
guy dies after was trapped in burning house, 10% of his total body surface area is burnt. initially stable no significant edema but dies 3 days later after **progressive dyspnea**
- cause of death: inhalation injury 
1. inhalation injury - not seen for 24-48 hrs, 
	- this is direct effect of heat/toxic compoenents
	- in smoke - watr soluble gases = upper airway dmg
	- lipid soluble gases - deeper airways, pneumonitis
2. CO poisoning = a lot of soot and black stuff deposited on their airways - they would die acutely tho and not delayed like inhalation injury 

in burns, esp with 20% TBSA burned, 
- edema devs in hours - inc in local osmotic pressure will draw out fluid into the intersitium 
- mediator induced vasc permeability everywhere
- significant pulmonary edema
- so much you can get hypovolemic shock. ): 
- rule of 9s handout is good for us in rotating in burn wards to know about but not tested #clinics 
- lines down the flank + abdomen of chest **fasciotomies**
	- where blood can't get into these areas anymore so ischemic necrosis will develop 

secondary burn infection - sepsis is leading cause of death 
- pseudomonas aeruginosa = most common 
- s. auereus 
- candida
- burn treatment = debridement down to the healthy tissue, and we put silver serum on to stop the cultural growth 

heat stroke - underlying pathophysiology = peripheral vasodilation with peripheral pooling of blood
- red, hot dry skin (**no sweating**), throbbing 
- body temp is higher >... 
- blood shunted away from the core, get muscle necrosis, arrhythmias, 
- DIC
- humidity not allowing sweat to evaporate increasing the risk of this, but usually this is with ppl with comorbidities 
heat cramps - thermoregulatory maintenance of mechanisms (body core temp stays the same)
- loss of electrolytes from sweating + cramps post-exercise 
heat exhaustion -  thermoregulatory maintenance of mechanisms (body core temp stays the same)
- sudden onset, prostration, collapse
- hypovolemia due to water depletion 
malignant hyperthermia - genetic condition, ca regulation in skeletal muscle is impact, so when exposed to anesthetics, calcium will skyrocket and then gneerate a ton of heat !!! 

axilla - we see ventricular fibrillation 
![[electricution.jpeg|242x154]]
- electricution injury = we see a crater central surrounded by white rim and then rid rim of hyperremia 
- fatal injury = ventricular fibrillation !!!
- high voltage currents = can carry from 7k to 100000 volts 
	- a lot more burning
	- **direct contact not necessary = even if you walk past them the electricity would arc over, we see these in hurricane times ):**
	- medullary center paralysis + exensive burns seen- 
- household low voltage 120 AC
	- small crater and smaller injury 
	- AC = so if you contact it, you cna't rlly fall away
		- induction of **muscle tetany, which means you can't let go. can induce respiratory paralysis**
	- might yell out and then collapse due to ventricullar fib 
	- no production of burns 
- v-fib = 100 miliamps 
- amps = volts/ohms (skin is the resistance component)
	- with dry skin, the ohms will be higher
	- with wet skin, your resistance drops
