there's so many lmao 
more benign than malignant 
RF: generally unknown aside from inhertied tumor syndromes (p53 mutation) or radiation burns toxins 
when tumors are malignant mesenchymal: "sarcomas"
- significant malignancy/morbitidy , req multidisciplinary treatment like surg, radation, chemo 
	- **freq metastasis to lungs via blood vessels - not lymph nodes!!!**
	- FNCLCC - grading system 
		- differentiation score 1-3 (like if it still looks like tissue of origin it's 1)
		- mitotic acitivty 1-3 
		- necrosis 0-2 
	- grade 1 = 2-3 total score
	- grade 2 = 4-5 score
	- grade 4 = 6-8 score 

- they are tumors from mesenchymal lineage, classed by presumed origin
- smooth muscle = "leiomyo-"
	- benign ones are leimyomas and most commonly called "fibroids'
		- middle aged adults, in skin, deep cutq, uterus, retropertoneum, viscera 
		- solitary or multipel 
		- recall: **reed syndrome HLRCC - fumarate hydratase mutation**
		- tREAT: surveillance or excision 
		- grossly, whorled, circumscribed, and fascicles of smooth muscle cells in 90 degree angles - **perpendicular intersection, bland spindled and CIGAR SHAPED** with pointy/blunt end 
		- ![[leiomyoma histo.jpeg|268x233]]
	- leiomyosarcoma - 
		- looks way diff, no bulging surface, is soft, hemorrhagic, and shows necrosis 
		- wide ragne demo 
		- extremities, retroperitoneum, trunk's large vessels
		- will show **symptoms secondary to compression/invasion**
		- looks similar to above, just with **necrosis, pleomorphism, ANC high ratio**
- skeletal muscle = "rhabdo" 
	1. rhabdomyoma = benign 
		- seen in head, neck, heart, and GU tract
		- fetal type <2 yo, adult type in 30-80 yo 
		- painless mass, some syndromes - **gorlin-goltz basal cell nevus syndrome, birt-hogg-dube, tuberous sclerosis**
		- **sheets of polygonal cells with focal vascuolation, SPIDER CELLS**
		- ![[rhabdomyoma histo.jpeg|216x277]]
	2. rhabdomyosarcoma - many varieties
		1. alveolar
			- 10-25 yo, 
			- in deep soft tissue of extremities/head+neck
			- ==FOXO1 gene mutation==, these all look like alveolar nests
			- ![[alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma histo.jpeg]]
			- we know these are ==rhabdomyoblasts bc we have a bunch of nucleus in a pink cytoplasm pushed off into the side. white parts alveolar nests==
		2. spindle cell/sclerosing
			- wide demo range, head and neck + extremities duh 
			- ==subset have MYOD1 mutation== some of these 
		3. embryonal 
			- cluster of grapes appearance, seen on anus 
			- commoner, head + neck GU, abdomen
			- sarcoma **botryoides**
			- syndromes - **costello, NF1, DICER1, Li-Fraumeni, noonan syndrome
			- small cell tumors, with **strap cells, with long pink cells, like some striations present**
			- ![[embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cell closeup.jpeg]]
		4. pleomorphic 
			- uncommon, in older ppl, 
			- in DEep soft tissue lower extremitiy 
- fat = "lipo-"
	- lipoma = benign 
		- 5-7th decade , happens in trunk, prox extremities
		- intramuscular, parosteal (on top of bone), visceral
		- painless mass, and 5% have multiple 
			- **can be caused by PTEN hamartoma syndrome, madelung dz**
		- up to 20 cm, most common soft tissue tumor in adults; KIDS don't get it !!!
		- TREAT: observation, excision. - might take it out bc worried
		- looks **EXACTLY LIKE NORMAL FAT, well circumscribed masses, very white!**
		- varities: angiolipoma - more capillary lines and symptomatic painfulness with fibrin thrombi 
		- **pleomorphic lipoma - scattered  pleomorphic cells on the inside, not completely just fat.** 
	- liposarcoma
		- 4-5th decade, can be <5 to 20+ cm 
		- **well-differentiated when inside our body's visceral area- > retroperitoneum, paratesticular, mediastinum** = these get way bigger bc we dn't know it's growing until it presses on it!!
		- atypical lipomatous tumor = tumor in our extremities instead like our thigh 
		- we see big fatty nasty gross tumor with browning 
		- ==molecular = MDM2 amplification for diagnosese==
		- dedifferentiated liposarcoma = **basically it can just change into any soft tissue sarcoma... low or high grade dediff of only the well-diffeerentiated variety**
		- myxoid liposarcoma - **on deep extremity like inner thigh**
			- ==these pts have t(12;16) FUS-DDIT3, usually younger too==
		- ![[well differentiaed liposarcoma histo.jpeg|295x219]] basically a ton of fat cells, just with some weird atypical cells mixed in 
		- ![[dedifferentiated liposarcoma histo.jpeg|293x225]]dedifferentiated liposarcoma 
		- ![[myxoid liposarcoma histo.jpeg]] bluish-gray myxoid appearance, with **gray chickenwire appearance as capillaries, hexagonal**
- nerve
- vessel
- fibrous tissue = 2 benign entities shown 
	- nodular fasciitis -
		- in young adults, superficial location like subq or superficial trauma
		- rapidly growign mass, sometimes a hx f trauma 
		- very well circumscribed mass, ==USP6 rearrangement==
		- we see plump spindle cells in **tissue culture pattern, swirly storibform , plump spindle forms without pleomorphism and RBC extravasation**
		- ![[nodular fasciitis histo.jpeg|316x241]]
		- if you zoom in you see white parts representing edema, but otherwise bland spindle cells
	- fibromatosis/desmoid tumors
		- young middle aged adults mostly men 
		- in extremities, retroperitoneum, abdomen, chest wall
		- clinical hx = fixed, painless mass - scary bc infiltraitive appearance + fixed on imging
		- superficial forms = less aggro 
			- **dupuytrens contractor - contracture of palmar hand, finger's contracting in fibrosing**
			- ledderhose = platnar hand contracture, fibrosis 
			- peyronie penile - disease, learned before in GU !!! curvature of penis 
		- desmoid tumor - localized form - **associated with GARDNER SYNDROME**
		- all have ==b-catenin CTNNB1 mutations==
		- they are all pretty small but can cause big life changes 
		- ![[desmoid tumor or fibromatosis histo.jpeg]] very infiltrative, and sweeping feathery fibroblasts are all in there 
		- **CORKSCREW APPEARANCE, spindle cells going in the same direction**
- uncertain/misc origin
	1. synovial sarcoma - not rlly from the synovium
		- adolesents and YAs
		- deep soft tissue of extremities, classically around a joint 
		- slow growing mass
		- ==t(X;18) SS18-SSX==
		- variants of monophasic and biphasic 
			- monophasic, marbled spindle cells (lighter and darker cells)
			- biphasic - has spindle cells and epithelial/gland-like component. 
			- ![[monophasic and biphasic synovial sarcoma histo.jpeg|163x256]]
	2. undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma 
		- Dx of exclusion - high grade sarcoma that lacks characteristics of other tumors
		- happens in ADULTS only, and happens anywhere 
		- complex karyotype ; no fusions (usually bland and monotonous), theses are cmplex and weird
