brachial plexus - wait for the full lecture on this 
- observe that there's many cords. 

origin muscle = proximal, more stable + fixed during muscle contraction; connect to less movable bone 
head = at end of origin muscle where it **fixes to bone**
insertion =  connections to the bone via tendons, opposite site of origin to more movable bone, moves with te muscle contraction. 
extrinsic = originate outside of a specific area (like the forearm for hand muscles) and insert into it
intrinsic = both originate and insert within that area

learn the brachial plexus = entire upper limb innervation, much of the interest in nerves

typically movement is from the orgin to insertion? feel the movements too while learning 
focus on the movements!!!! if you know the movements we know where it attaches 
- look at netters + the movements 

==all superficial back muscles **originate from** axial skeleton, but inserts on bones of upper limb.== innervated by ==ventral primary rami/nerves from ventral primary rami, which comes from the ventral root== 
- these are outshoots from the front spinal nerves
- ==origin of superficial back muscle = usually from vertebral spinous process except levator scapulae from transverse. then the insertion is usually on scapula, except for latissimus dorsi (on the humerus's floor of bicipital groove)==
![[ventral and dorsal spinal nerve.png]]
==true back muscles = innervated by **dorsal primary** rami==
==all are innervated by ventral primary rami except trapezius, innervated by accessory n== 


know the parts of the clavicle: 
acromial end, sternal end, adn then superior vs inferior surface. 
acromal - = lateral end
sternal is most medial 

scapula = memorize the many parts of it 
![[humerus and scapula.jpeg]]
acromion, coracoid process, glenoid cavity(shoulder hole, at the supraglenoid tuberrcle meeting with the scapula's head), neck, angles and borders, supra and infraglenoid tubercles, suprascapular notch, subscapular fossa, spine(on the posterior of the scapula, that part going to the acromion projection), supraspinous and infraspinous fossae.
- acromion = anterior projection from lateral end of the scapula spine.... continuous with spine of scapula at acromial angle, extending anteriorly over the glenohumeral joint 
	- connection to the clavicle 
- coracoid process thick curved anterior projection from head and neck of scapula.... origin of coracobrachialis + short head of bicep brachii musles + insertion of pectoralis minor.... 
- note the angles + borders , as well as the medial, superior, inferior etc. 
- the supra/infraglenoid tubercles = **are all attachment points for muscles tmro!**
- spine of scapula = note this, many sit here. 
- supraspinous foss + intraspinous fossa have muscles which sit there. 
^^^ 
on the humerus. - note the anatomical neck (higher, above that greater tubercle, below the head of humerus) + surgical neck (lower, under the greater tubercle)
- greater + lesser tubercle = attachment point
- intertubercular sulcus = bicipital groove - also attachment for muscles 
- know: head, anatomical neck, surgical neck, greater tubercle(more lateral+anterior, on top there's the supraspinatus muscle) , lesser tubercle(medial, subscapularis muscle distal attachment), 
- intertubercular sulcus (bicipital groove, **in betweeen the greater and lesser tubercle but inferior to it**; basically a divot next to the distal attachments of teres major, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis major),
	- latissimus dorsi insertion 
- deltoid tuberosity(lateral sticking out point, of the longbone, notably where the **deltoid muscles distally attach**) 
- radial groove(on posterior, the large groove running to the side of the deltoid tuberosity - **proximal brachialis muscle attachment**).

superficial layer - 
- trapezius + latissimus 
- trapezius = origins skull, ligamentum nuchae, spinous processes of C7 + all 12 thoraccic vertebrae
	- unusual attachment, to lateral 1/3 superiorpart of clavicle. 
	- on the back, from the back we have the movement based on  ligamentum nuchae and skull
		- ligamentum nuchae = continuous with supraspinous ligament, at the back of neck. shiny part attaching to the spine 
		- attaches to skull superiorly as occipital protuberance to tips of the spinal procsses of C7 inferiorly 
	- note the movements - move things elevation, upward rotation, retraction + depression. 
		- upper part will elevate scapula, middle fibers retract it. and lower ones pull the medial border of scapula, making the glenoid fossa up. 
	- innervation: spinal accessory n and branches of ventral primary rami C3 and C4 
		- this nerve will exit the skull thru jugular foramen to immediately innervate this, then goes more down running deep to trapezius but superficial to rhomboids 
		- this does motor innervation for the trapezius, and then the sensory innervation provided by the C3/4 nerves. 
	- blood supply is superficial branch transverse cervical artery **be careful of this during dissection...**
		- transverse cervial artery (be4 splitting into superficial/deep) direct/indirect branch of the subclavian artery 
- latissimus dorsi - originate from iliac crest, prominant thoracolumbar fascia + spingous processes of 6th-12th thoracic .... and sometimes 3-4 ribs/inferior angle of scapula 
	- looks like wings from the spinous processes of T6-12
	- insertion on floor of bicipital groove of the humerus 
	- attaches to shoulder, gonna adduct. 
		- - only superficial muscle inserting into the humerus!!!
	- also since it's on shoulder, extends + internally rotates arm. 
	- also depresses the arm, pulling it forward when arms fixed overhead 
	- when arms are straight up, it will stabilize the trunk , moving upwards. 
	- innervated by t**horacodorsal nerve** 
		- this attaches, and then we'll see it travel along the diagonal , not necessarily all the branches
		- from posterior cord of the brachial plexus between upper/lower subscapular nerves 
		- descends on the anterior surface of the subscapularis muscle and then downward to the latissimus dorsi muscle !
		- the long thoracic nerve is from a branching point but slightly lower than it, running parallel to the thoracacodorsal nerve on the chest wall 
			- long thoracic nerve innervates serratus anterior muscle 
- note: there's a tendon of latissimus dorsi passing **anterior to tendon of teres major...** since it's superficial. 


![[shoulder muscles deep and superficial.jpeg]]**deep layer**
- levator scapulae - originate from transverse (unique!) processes of C1-4
	- insert: at **superior angle at superior portion of medial border of scapula** - this is on the medial border of the scapula, just the top of it when you see it posteriorly 
	- when spine is fixed, elevates scapulae + rotates inferior angle medially ... 
	- similar to the trapezius in movements potentially 
	- innervated by dorsal scapular nerve and v.p.r. of C3 and C4
		- we won't really see the origin in dissection bc it's up high in the neck .... but will see it as it **travels along medial border of the scapula**
		- **the dorsal scapular nerve leaves C5 ventral primary ramus to continue back and down the medial aspect of medial border of scapula** 
- rhomboid major = from spine of 2nd-5th thoracic insertions = dorsal scapular nerve 
	- DEEP branch transverse cervical artery supplies this
	- dorsal scapular arteries will supply both major and minor, seen on the medial border of scapula 
	- from T2-5 spinous processes, inserting onto medial border of scapula between root of spine + inferior angle of scapula 
	- helps hold the scapula onto ribcage + retracts pulling it to vertebrae (abduction) + elevates the medial border of scapula, downward rotation. 
- rhomboid minor = from ligamentum nuchae (similar to trapezius) + spines of 7th cervical and 1st thoracic vertebrae = dorsal scapular nerve  innervatin 
	- this is above the rhomboid major and smaller too. 
	- leads to the insert onto the **medial border from the scapula, IMMEDIATELY MEDIAL to the root of the scapula spine**
- major = hold scapula to ribcage

shoulder muscles = all originate from the scapula 
superficial layer
- deltoid muscles - from spine of scapula/clavicle, inserting on humerus, crossing only one joint glenohumeral joint
	- stabilizes and produces movements at shoulder joint
	- **this is the inferior 1/3 of the clavicle, counter muscle is the trapezius which are superior 1/3rd**
	- originates from spine of scapula, acromion and then the lateral 1/3 of clavicle; 
	- insert on deltoid tuberosity 
	- abduction (up and down arm flap) , flexion  (internal rotation) + extension (external rotation
	- very strong
	- axillary nerve C5-6
- supraspinas muscle - from supraspinous fossa of scapula, inserts on greater tubercle of humerus + CAPSULE of shoulder joint
	- muscle passes **UNDER acromion** but over the shoulder joint
	- bordered by acromion, above the spine of scapula, and to the lateral side of the medial border of the scapula.... 
	- abducts to about 60%, note that it's mainly on the INSIDE. if you abduct more, that's gonna be the delts. 
	- this does same as the deltoids 
	- C5-6 suprascapular nerve runs underneath also with the corresponding artery  
	- most commonly torn in rotator cuffs. 
- infraspinatus muscles - originates from infraspinatus fossa, inserting on **GREATER tubercle** of humerus + capsule of shoulder joint
	- gonna be about retraction, pulling stuff back. external rotator, adducts inferior angle of scapula away from midpoint. ofc it reinforces capsule of shoulder joint. 
	- going to the sides, under the spine of scapula and in **2 pairs**, inserting ont the greater tubercle
	- this is slightly superior to the teres minor and major
	- C5-6 supascapular nerve 
- subscapularis muscles - from the subscapular fossa of scapula, inserting on the **lesser tuberosity** (on the inside) of the humerus
	- involved in contracting your arms inward, counter to ___
	- C5-6 lower subscapular nerves AND upper subscapular nerves (basically part of the brachial plexus)
		- arise from posterior cord, downward on anterior surface of subscapularis muscle
		- these are basically a posterior cord 
- teres major/minor; minor above the major 
	- both from lateral border of scapula
	- minor on the upper 2/3, posterior , inserting onto greater tubercle of humerus + capsule of shoulder joint 
		- holds humeral head in place, allows lateral rotation of shoulder, same orientation as infraspinatus, 
		- axillary C5-6 = this arises from posterior cord, posterior to shoulder then thru quadrangular space. innervates deltoid + teres minor bc it's close to it 
	- major is anterior, on lower 1/3, insert on medial lip of bicipital groove, similar to the latissimus dorsi, so both kinda do the same thing 
		- medial rotation similar to latissimus + abduction 
		- C5-6 lower subscapular nerves only  
	- both involved in medial rotation and abduction. 
	- innervated 

anatomical spaces = both triangular space + quadrangular space = created **by dissection**, reflect deltoid muscle + remove stuff
- quadrangular space 
	- superior = teres minor
	- inferior = teres major
	- lateral = surg neck of humerus 
	- medially long nhead of triceps 
	- contents = axillary nerve + posterior circumflex humeral vessels 
	- this looks like a shortish small rectangle , or a trapezoid 
- triangular space = medial to that = teres minor/major
	- lateral = long head of triceps = contents of the circumflex scapular vessels 

extra - suprascapular nerve - lat branch of superior trunk of brachial plexus, getting C5-6 sometimes C4 
artieries (army?) runs on top of the suprascapular notch but the nerve (navy) goes under

SITs muscles = all helps maintain and holds it in space
- supraspinatus
- infraspinatus
- teres minor
- subscapularis 
these all help rotator maintenance, there's anything with rotator cuff issues with tearing. 


subdeltoid bursas - more of joint-related this - serous sac of fluid that reduces tension where msucles/tendons on bones are moved etc. 
- lined with synovial membrane + contianing fluid; found between tendon + bone / ligament ot reduce friction - 
- all throughout msk. 

scapular anastomosis !! important concept
- around the bones, arteries will help circulation tremendously  ... **greater chance of occlusion, so that's why we have these** - seen in long bones/union of many bones too 
- and stuff that can tear easily and get occluded. we get collateral circulation so we can still get blood to these aras.

cliniical info injuries
- rotator cuff tears - can be dmg thru trauma or dz process (older ppl like muscles tightening up + tears)
- - pain, **shoulder instaiblity + limited range f motion, trouble elevating arm.**
- most common = supraspinatous  tear
- when we have a reduction in space for supraspinatous muscl -> more injury , more acromion will peak thru over time in older ppl 

look into med imaging. 
glenoid cavity - think of cavity of shoulder
and note the surgical vs anatomical neck seen on the xray anterior shoulder image.
