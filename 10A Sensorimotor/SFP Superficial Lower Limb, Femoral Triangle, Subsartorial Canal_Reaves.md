this is a broad overview!! not supposed to get evrything out of this 

big diff between this and the upper limbs = we see that **effects on one side can impact the other greatly, mainly via trying to compensate**

look more into surface anatomy 
- sub-sartorial triangle anterior
- lateral posterior tigh 
- anterior knee
- posterior knee
- proximal leg 
thigh is sparate from the leg; it's above the knee and to pelvis 
leg is below the knee

general org
- hip 
	- pelvic bone
- hip joint (lower)
- thigh
	- deep fascia of thigh = fascia lata = very tight in the area of muscle
	- know : **great saphenous V** (and small saphenous v identified in lab) through saphenous opening to femoral V 
	- falciform margin = on the lateral edge of saphenous opening is where it is 
	- iliotibial tract = on the lateral side. thickens from fascia lata  
		- when ppl's knees tighten up "my knees are killing me!!" it's usually this that's tightened, which is why we must stretch 
		- this is a band of connective tissue from the iliac tubercle all the way to the gerdy's tubercle - 
		- insertion on below the knee: tibia (gerdy's tubercle), head of fibula, lateral patella 
		- 2 muscles insert onto the iliotibial tract
			- gluteus maximus 
			- tensor fasciae latie (on the anterior side instead) = anterior margin aligned with the anterior margin of tensor fascia latae 
	- fascial compartments of thigh 
		- intermuscular septa
			- medial 
			- lateral = more prominent as a **septum**
			- posterior 
	- cutaneous nerves = from L1-4 
		- lateral ffemoral cutaneous nerve = most lateral 
		- anterior femoral cutaneous nn = sort of diagonal
		- br of obturator n = this is most medial going down 
		- and **sacral plexus L4-5, S1-4** gives:
			- posterior femoral cutaneous nerve, this is **on the back side of the thigh**
	- femur
	- innervation of THIGH
		- **anterior** compartment = by **femoral** N (L2-4)
			- looks like wtich broom 
			- anterior thigh sensory = anterior cutaneous br 
			- medial leg = medial cutaneous br of saphenous N, also infrapatellar br of saphenous N 
		- **medial** compartment = by **obturator** from L2-4
			- several musles = there for adcuction or rotation of the knee, of the entire lower limb 
			- innervates all the adductor compartment muscles 
			- sensory too to medial compartment of thigh + cutaneous br
		- **posterior** compartment = by sciatic **nerve** from L4,5,S1-3
			- largest nerve in the body 
			- sensory into posterior thigh = posterior femoral cutaneous S1-3 (on the back of the thigh)
			- sural N = from the sciatic nerve, this is for the posterior leg 
				- note - there's also a variation of having a lateral sural which might combine with the sural as it descends down the leg. 
- knee
	- back of knee = popliteal fascia 
	- tremendous collateral circulation as it's a lot of bone!
	- genicular = knee/bend!
- leg
	- the iliotibial tract continues into becoming the **crural fascia of the leg, very tight! careful in dissection**
		- great saphenous vein = anterior, continues to the dorsal venous arch in the foot 
			- in the form of the prominent superficial vein: **medial side of dorsal venous arch** will travel in that direction and eventually combine with that , also **connects to femoral vein thru the saphenous opening of the fascia lata** 
			- tributaries: (at saphenous opening)
				- superficial circumflex iliac v 
				- superficial epigastric v 
				- superficial external pudendal v 
				- accessory saphenous vs  (both lateral + medial)
			- in the leg, we have the prominent saphenous N emerging on the medial aspect of the knee following it down 
			- this is one way flow, towrds the heart, gr8 saphenous v drains to the **femoral vein at saphenous opening** 
				- in this time, valves are with the venous junction
		- small saphenous vein = posterior , pierces to drain into popliteal vein 
			- from **lateral** side of dorsal venous arch 
			- emergies in that fascia on that posterior portion j below the knee 
			- connects with the dorsal venous arch just **posteriorly**
			- will ascend on psoterior leg + drain ultimately to popliteal vein
			- accompanied by the **sural n**
		- cutaneous nerves are superficial to crural fascia = superficial br of the fibular nerve ens up cutaneous to dorsum of foot too 
		- note that being non-distensible = **potential for compartment syndrome**
			- 6 P's of compartment syndrome 
	- fascial compartments of leg 
		- very tight + strong, 3 intermuscular sepaae
		- anterior
		- posterior
		- transverse 
		- creates these compartments:
			- anterior
			- lateral
			- superficial posterior (made by transverse)
			- deep posterior (made by transverse)
	- cutaneous nerves of the leg
		- saphenous n (L4 br of femoral N), most medial to knee and right under the patella 
		- br of superficial fibular N = L4,5,S1, this is most lateral on the front 
		- br of deep fibular n = from L5, this is on the dorsum of foot, close to the big toe, supplies space bt first and 2nd toe web 
		- lateral sural n = L4,5,S1 = this is under the calf?
		- sural N = L5,S1,2 = under the br of lateral ,sural N, the continuation close to ankles , but a lot of variation
	- tibia
	- fibula
- ankle 
	- flexor (medial) and extensor retinacula (on the anterior + dorsum)
		- crural fascia thickened at the ankle = will become the retinaculum = allows for movement to take place by holding the tendons. 
		- extrinsic = tendons that infiltrate foot and intrinsic = muscles in the foot, same deal 
- foot
	- on the dorsum nerves: (all from sciatic n)
		- superficial fibular nerve which would innervate lateral compartment of leg will become s**uperficial to dorsum of foot**
		- then the deep fibular nerve which would pass into the foot becomes **cutaneous to the web space in between first and 2nd digits**
	- dorsum of foot - there's many plantar/arcuate etc... names similar 
	- plantar foot nerves: (all from sciatic?)
		- many msucles, but the innervation is from the tibial nerves , 
		- common nerves vs when it bifurcates for the toes too, naming very similar to palmar hands 
		- medial plantar and lateral plantar enters, there's also deep branch 
	- tarsals
	- metatarsals
	- phalanges 
dorsum = dorsal foot 
plantar = like palmar foot 

fascia - CT mostly of collagen that surrounds everything, connecting skin to deeper structures
- defined by perimysium is oriented in a variety of ways that determine strength of muscl + direction in which it pulls 

dermatomes
![[dermatomes of lower limb.png]]
note - on L4 - meidial side of gret toe, medial patella 
and L5  - note that this is also innervated by deep fibular nerve. this is gonna be antrior component, but this other thing is cutaneous 
and then the S1, 2 , 3 

veins of lower limb into the foot
![[veins of lower limb into the foot.png]]
- profunda femoral very similar to the brachial profunda a 
- really see in lab: the saphenous veins.
perforating veins
- varicose veins - where incompetent vaalves are there, can't push that blood flow to heart well, so they fill up and bulge, **blood flow reversed**
	- mainy a failure to drain up to the femoral vein 
	- superficial veins will distend 
- superficial veins will connect to **deep veins - venae comitantes**
	- typically a one-way flow using valves from superficial to deep

lymphatics of lower limb
- follow the vessels
- with gr8 saphenous vein to superficial inguinal nodes
- areas draining to these superficial inguinal
	- skin + superficial tissues of 
	- lowr limb, abd wall below umbilicus 
	- perineum
	- genitalia, not testes
	- fundus of uterus via round ligament
	- run with small saphenous vein to popliteal nodes

deep inguiinal lymph nodes
- from superficial lymph nodes flowing into **inguinal lymhp nodes below inguinal ligament as they follow femoral vessels**

part of thigh: femor
**femoral triangle** borders: some muscles would insert into these areas like hip flexors, etc 
- inguinal ligament
- medial border of sartorius M 
- medial border of adductor longus m 
- this is covereed by fascia lata 
![[femoral triangle.jpeg]]

it contains  (lat to medial NAV)
- femoral n
- femoral a 
	- goes from common (near the clavicles, but the br below can either come from here or the deep br) 
	- to deep femoral A branch / profunda femoris A 
		- media circumflex femoral a  - pass between **psoas and pectineus**
		- lateral circumflex femoral a - **pass bt iliacus and rectus femoris**
		- perforating br = for tremendous collateral circulation, esp when the vessels wrap around the bone. 
			- these will supply and pierce the adductor brevis and adductor magnus muscles to **reach posterior thigh**
	- eventually as it goes down, the femoral A becomes the popliteal A as it **pass thru adductor hiatus**
		- **Perforating** **veins** of the leg pierce deep fascia to connect between superficial and deep veins. = they're known for having that special valve to let a one-way flow from superficial to deep. 
- femoral v 
- note - floor is trough shaped
![[femoral triangle]]

femoral sheath = has 3 compartments 
- transversalis fascia + iliacus fascia
- surrounds femoral a , v, lymphs 
- cnotinues **posterior to inguinal ligament into femoral triangle**
	- the femoral nerve = is not in sheath, but **psoterior to iliacus fascia**
		- looks like "witch's broom, since it's spread out to innervate **ALL of anterior component of thigh**"
		- what IS in the sheath = femoral artery and vein 
	- femoral ring. = thickened medial edge of the femoral canal itself , the ring (lymphatics, medial)

supply of neck + head of FEMUR 
- retinacular arteries, 
- lateral + medial circuflex femoral aas -> neck of femur
- the acitabular br of the obturator artery also supplies the head and neck 


med imaging - extension of anatomy, don't worry all that much about it
