subscapularis - most likely injury with rotator cuff injury 
lumbricals - 
- only 2 medial umbrical musles are paralyzed from inuries w severe compression to the ulnar nerve....
- thenar eminence + **2 lateral lumbrical muscles are not affected, innervatd by the median nerve** 
- in situation, both the flexor + extensor extrinsic musles are unopposed, so this causes a clawed hand. 

none of the flexors extrinsicly can also exten
- lumbricals + interosseus muscles can both extend + flex ; this synergy happens ultimately 
- cause flexion in MCP bc they insert into the extensor expansion, which is part of the tendon from **below**, and pull on this extensor tendon when flexing... that's how they cause both. 

recall: rotator cuff - SITS muscles inserting on tuberosity  
- superspinatous = most likely one to get injured in adults bc it rubs on the acromion process 
- infrapsinatous 
- teres minor 
- subscapularis 

brachial plexus injury 
- grabbing a branch 
- why is it lateral 2 lumbricals that aren't injured
	- bc it's innervated not by the ulnar nerve, but the median n. 
- **in traction injuries - these are injuries at the ROOT**
	- can have upper brachial plexus
	- lower brachial plexus
		- in the case of lower = you afect the roots. 
		- C8, T1 impacted with brachial plexus - major components of ulnar nerve
		- all other intrinsi muscles of hands innervated by the ulner nerve except the adductor pollicis of the thenar eminence 
hyperabduction T1, C8 = - **Cause:** Can occur when the arm is forced upward and away from the body, like when grasping something to break a fall or in a birth injury where the arm is pulled excessively. lower BP injury 

5 and 6 lesion  - - **Cause:** Often result from the shoulder being forced down while the head is tilted away, like in a fall or during childbirth ([shoulder dystocia](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=2fee5486871b890d&q=shoulder+dystocia&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj63-T5hbCPAxVfkmoFHV1DHtwQxccNegUIwAEQAQ)).upper BP injury

case 1 
CC arm pain 
12 yo female
- arm pain after skate injury 
- feel onto l arm + shoulder 
- which part of the arm hurts? 
- whend the pain start?
- silent for a bit and screamed due to pain; feels something snap. 
- uppeer L arm throbbing, can't move hand!!!!
- pain started immediately pain was sharp but changed to throbbing + numbness 
- skin intact, no obv deformities 
- pain w/ touch over entire upper arm 
- numbness - **in dorsolateral surface of wrist + hand**
	- radial n? 
nerves in the arm? 
- musculocutaneous
- axillary
- ulnar
- radial 
- median 
- medial antebrachial cutaneous
- lateral antebrachial cutaneous = 
both suppply sensation in forearm + hand?
- radial - innervates dorsum of hand laterally but way up in the arm, will give posterior cutaneous br into forearm  
- ulnar - nerve innervates a bit of skin above the wrist /: comes off higher bruh 

phys exam
- pain w touch over entire upper arm 
- intact touch over forearm 
- **numbness in dorsolat surface of hand, at base of thumb + index finger**
	- - superficial br of radial 
- intact touch on all fingers 
	- median + ulnar 
radial nerve = damaged directly = wrist drop 
posterior interosseuous contributes = dmg = wrist drop 

partial wrist drop - maintain some weak extension 
- partial wrist drop = the extensor spared in patients is the extensor carpi radialis longus 
	- bc this is as it's more distal... involvs only deep br of radial nerve.
	- but this one receives a direct radial nerve supply prior to branching into deep and nondeep. 
**total** wrist drop - direct dmg to the radial 
- order xray 

patient can't extend the thumb 
- can't do that either wiht pressure or without 
- extensor pollicis longus + brevis = can extend the thumb 

what additional symptoms might occur? explain why
- weakened pronation of arm? would be minimal - loss of brachioradialis innervation, which does maintain the limb in mid-prone position; we still have pronator teres + quadratis intact , so maybe some weakening, but minimal 
- weakened flexion of the forearm = yes bc the brachioradialis is taken out 
	- brachioradialis = "beer drinking motion"
	- weakened in the mid=prone position 
- weakened supination of forearm - radial nerve ennervates supinator 
	- not a total loss, bc the biceps are still there + work in tandem. 
- loss of extension at elbow
	- radial nerves ennervate the triceps - 
	- there's branches that go straight to the muscle - deep br of radial nerve 
		- already gave supply before the lesion 
	- extension is fine bc the nerves cam e out above 
- weakened grip of hand
	- yes bc radial n altho it doesnt innervate anything in hand, will LOSE the position of function - you're at a wrist drop 
	- slight extension = "the position of function" 
- weak abduction of hand, lost nervation to 
	- extensor carpi, radialis brevis + longus 
	- bc of insertion they also abduct 
- on opposite side, flexor carpi ulnaris is fine, but flexion is weaker bc one side is doing it 
- weakened adduction bc lost the extensor carpi ulnaris 
location of humeral fracture = location is eveything, know where nerve is branching.

case 2 
58 yo o
right shoulder pain + weakness in r arm 
trouble lifting things
can't reach above head or lift anything 
- r arm weak and bclumsy after 
- breast cancer
- removed r breast cancer - removed it 
- weakness not improoving, hurst worse after driving for 20 + min 
- nsaids don't help 

phys ex
- ROM + assess function 
- well healed r modified radical msastectomy , axillary lyph node dissection etc. 
- all reflexes seem to be normal?// 
- no evience edema 
- radical mastectomy - muscles that req complete/partial removal 
	- pec major + minor 
	- none= for moddified radical mascectomy - only the breast tissue are removed. 

4 central nodes taken - so axillary dissection stopped. 
most vulnerable nerve in the field of axillary n ?? - 
- long thoracic nerve - on the sides of the thorax, armpits 

3/5 str with flexion, 3/5s str with abduction of R arm from shoulder
- scapular protrudes posteriorly + medially 
- winged scapula = **long thoracic nerve dmg**
- unopposed are rhomboid major+minor muscles - will retract scapula, mediallly rotate 
- and levator scapula too - elevates scapula 
- anything that is innervated by dorsal scapular n 

lateral winged scapula instead of medially taken 
whole shoulder's drooping - and medial border is too far lateral including inferior angle 
issue might be with the 
- spinal accessory n trapezius is lost. 

full exam- struggled with mvemnt and unable to abduct arm beyond 90 degrees 
- which muscle contributes to full abduction beyond 90 degrees
- supraspinatous - 0-15 degrees
- deltoid = 15-50 
- trapezius + serratus anterior = both for beyond 90 degrees 
	- need to not only rotate the ENTIRE scapula but also move the entire thing laterally

wrist pain 
this side of radial side of right wrist hurts
starts as stiffness at bottom of thumb that worsens with movement
sometimes pain extends up to the lateral side of forearm 
- gets worse, 4 mon ago 
- r handed ): nsaids don't help 
fractured scaphoid, they put a screw in it in the past 

inspection shows swelling proximal to styloid process of radius. 
- small well-healed scar on the volar aspect of wrist (scaphoid)
- tendonitis
- tenosynovitis - 
- osteoarthritis of scaphoid bone (anything on top of that?, like erosion from the past? )
- superficial radial nerve 
- finkelsteins test hurts 
- eichhoff's test = hurts
	- these make up the finkelsteins test in total, all called that - adduction and gentle flexion of thumb 
	- if you have other syndromes
	- u can gt false poz with eichoffs like w arthritis 
- conclusion - dequervains tenosynovitis
	- stenosing =  inflammation of synovium and **thickening of fibrous sheath in first extensor compartment.** 
	- first extensor compartment - you have 6 of them... things go thru each 6. 
	- the firs tone specifically are there
		- abductor pollicis longus + extensor pollicis brevis 
	- the extensor pollicis longus will go into the 3rd extensor compartment ... **making the snuff box, will get eroded** but it's not the dequervains tenosynovitis 
- can cure with stent - NSAIDs injections into tendon sheath ...

can't use hands to grap walker 
- complaints of pain + worsening loss of hand function 
- fears falling forward , walker gets ahead of her 
- osteoarthritis many years before. 
- pain in joints since 50s 
- 2 knee replacements, 2nd knee surg, 1 shoulder replacement + 1 hip replacement 
- biggest issue = the arthritis, can't use her fingers 
- redness+swelling of all digits = enlargment of PIP bouchards + DIP heberdens nodes - 
- some enlargement of metacarpophalangeal joitns 
- lack of sensation on both of the ulnar sides (both palmer+dorsal aspects) and medial 1 and 1/2 fingers. 
- unable to extend the medial 2 fingers at the PIP at rest 
- lateral 2 fingers not flexed at rest 
- cannot adduct the thumb but can abduct 
- cannot squeeze a piece of paper bt adjacent fingers, slipping fingers

following n dmg'd 
- sup br ulnar= loss of sensation 
- deep br ulnar = loss of movement, can't adduct thumb + atrophy of interosseus muscles 
- **dorsal br of ulnar n** = loss of dorsal sensation 
ulnar compression can happen in: 
- cubital tunnel - ulnar. + distal br 
- guyon's canal 
- thoracic outlet (but more unlikely, it'll get lower trunk of brachial plexus)
get MRI for skeletal issues 
electromyography - getting info on how good things will be with decompression and how much it can get better
nerrve conduction test 

make ulnar n dmg by phys exam but the EMG/NC components would indicate axonal dmg
- reduced conduction velocity - loss of nerve altogether
- decreased peak amplitude
why aer 2 digits flexed in partial claw config?
	bc of lumbricals! recall - they go up , tug on the extensor tendon, causing MCP flesxion and extension at PIP + DIP. 
	- loss of medial 2 lumbricals !!, flexion lost, flexor digitorum superficialis is unopposed (ennervated by median n, pulls down the phalanges at prox interphalangeal joint.)

median n dmg - flat simmion hand...
- can't adduct muscles. 

guyon's canal outside of carpal tunnel
- pisiform, hook of hamate, flexor retinaculum, palmar carpal ligament
