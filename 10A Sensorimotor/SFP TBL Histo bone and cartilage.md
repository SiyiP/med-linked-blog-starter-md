osteosarcoma - many cells dividing "L-osteoid" , lacy osteoid !!!
- see the difference between infection + sarcoma most importantly 

1. canaliculus enables direct contact between cells 
primary organic component of the matrix of bone 
- type 1 collagen 
2. secretion of alkaline phosphatase in the hypertrophic stage,...  in the hypertrophic layer so basically they would die and then get their bodies calcified 
	1. osteoprogenitor cells don't come from chondrocytes 
3. shows an arrow pointing to osteoid... made by blast 
4. calcified cartilage - the whiter parts in the mittle o the bone matrix devlopping, which will later get resorbed 
5. components responsible for hydration of the matrix - proteoglycans 
6. component pointed at - the endosteum of a compact bone, marrow side, very thin 
	1. megakaryocytes bone marrow 
	2. followup - component that vascularizes compact bone - haversian canals
	3. the blood vessels in compact bone will extend via volkmann canals + branch further to supply haversian canals 
	4. if you remove the periosteum, the bone will die bc these have a portion of blood supply going inwards 
7. monocytes -> osteoclast 
	1. pre-oosteoclast - Monoocyte = from progen cells CFU-GM of hematopoiesis in bone marrow
	2. mature steoclast = fusion of pre-osteoclast
	3. RANK = receptor n the osteoclast etc 
	4. RANKL = from osteoblast 
	5. OPG = inhibition of this process 
8. stimulation of forming the osteoclasts -> inc PTH 
	1. chief cells in parathyroid make PTH in response to Ca levels being too low 
	2. PTH binds to PTH1R in osteoblasts, which triggers making RANKL 
	3. etc 
9. fibrocartilage - intervertebral disc ? 
10. DEVELOPPING BONE - shows a form of lightness in the thing - woven bone, varying intesnity of which the soft pink thing has some white parts 
	1. woven bone will eventually get replaced by lamellar bone. 
	2. collagen not smooth and homogenous yet in this woven bone. lack the parallel. arrange ment of collagen in lamellar bone 
11. sickle cell dx with persistent pain in tihgh/fever/chills/leukocytosis, -> cause of this dz 
	1. salmonella - makes sense for fever + chills
	2. sickle cell = **predisposition to many g-negs** 
	3. areas of bone infarc + necrosis (white spots) = bacterial seeding
	4. asplenia - inc risk of osteomyelitis 
	5. neutrophilic acute inflammation = osteomyelitis 
12. most common bacterial cuase of osteomyelitis in older kids + adults 
	1. staph aureus 
	2. most common in poz pyogenic osteomyeitis 
13. osteoid osteoma - proximal right leg pain, releieved pain via aspirin - 
	1. osteoid osteoma - relieved by regional pain NSAIDs
	2. osteoid - **we see a bunch of new bones being laid down, similar to interlacing traveculae of woven bone**
	3. male predominance 
	4. small benign osteogenic bone lesions 
	5. osteoblastoma - not relieved by NSAIDs
14. osteoma ... in the skull we see - very thick but narrow bone, on sthe surface of bone 
	1. mature bone 
	2. 10-40 yr male 
	3. on craniofacial bones with sinus predominanc? 
15. past hx l thigh liposarcoma post-radiation - persistent + progressive pain around l knee 
	1. recent fall prior to this 
	2. see a little thin thing jut out from the xray 
	3. learn radiology according to the slides. 
	4. osteosarcoma - **codman's triangle**
		1. seen in malignant bone basically tumors/rapidly growign lesions. - 
		2. pushes the periosteum out, making a bulging out of soft tissue underneath!!!!
		3. distal femur > prox tibia > prox humerus 
		4. 10-20 y/ male predominance 
	5. histologically recall it's pale staining abnormal bone trabeculae.... and bone marrrow with no hematopoietic cells. 
16. x rays - note epiphyseal plates seen in hands + femur 
	1. osteopetrosis - diffuse skeletal sclerosis with decreased function of osteoclasts.... 
	2. **erlenmyer flask deformity**
	3. bones hard and brittle, susceptible to frature
	4. sevrity and onset is a wide variable spectrum 
	5. infantile and intermediate onset, AR inheritance
	6. but adults are audosomal dominant 
17. 62 yo man - black spot in the head, pretty widespread skeletal showings of 
	1. paget's disease - of widespread remodeling of bone 
	2. holes in the bones of the xray? 
	3. relatively common metabolic disorder
	4. thickened bones overall, woven type bones that are brittle
	5. overgorwth + compression of bones
	6. **asymmetric in pelvis**
- calvarial overgrowth can comprss cranial nerves causing deafness/blindness and lion face
- -other thing - disordered and excessive bone remodding causing **many chaotic cement lines!!!**
