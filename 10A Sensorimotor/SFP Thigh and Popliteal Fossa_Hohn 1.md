fascia lata encloses muscles of the thigh 
- attached superiorly to inguinal ligament
- at the most superior aspect, there's the **saphenous opening , allowing the great saphenous vein to drain the leg anteriorly**
- thigh divided into anterior, medial + posterior with the 3 intermuscular septa
	- lateral (strongest, should see it in lab, going from the iliotibial tract to the linea aspera of the femur)
	- medial
	- posterior 
each compartment have one nerve and blood supply 

anterior compartment
5 muscles
- sartorious = lateral to medial 
	- long skinny, longest muscle in body 
	- from the ASIS to the upper medial surface of the tibia
	- crosses the 2 joints, so flexes the knee and the thigh 
	- weakly abducts and laterally rotates thigh + for sitting cross legged = "tailors muscle"
- iliacus 
	- both iliacus and psoas: 
	- from iliac fossa
	- insertioni to lesser trochanter 
	- more distal aspect of muscle: smaller, teardropped shape called "iliopsoas"
- psoas
	- more medially from lumbar vertebrae 
	- insertion lesser trochanter 
	- combines to make iliopsoas - they both flex thigh and stabilizes hip joint 
- pectineus
	- from superior ramus of pubis insertion to just inferior of lessor trochanter at linea aspera
	- crosses hip joint
	- flexes + adducts thigh 
		- although it's NOT in medial component like the rest of the adductors.. 
		- this should be in medial but is anterior  primariy bc it's innervated by the femoral nerve 
- quadriceps femoris - 
	- rectus femoris - flex hip at the thigh and extend leg at the knee by **common insertion of quadricepts tendon on patella via the patellar ligament which goes to the tibial tuberosity**
		- most superficial, 2 heads
		- str8 head = AIIS origin
		- reflected head = ilium superior to acetabulum origin 
	- vastus laterlis  - lateral to rectus femoris = from base of greater trochanter, intertrochanteric line, and linea aspera (on the **other** side, so it will swing around as fibers to that!)
	- vastus medialis - from intertrochantric line and also swing around to the linea aspera
		- **lower fibers of vastus medialis = almost horizontal bc this will prevent lateral sliding of the patella** durnig forceful quad contraction 
	- vastus intermedius - under rectus femoris
		- from anterior + lateral surface of femur
		- insertion into the DEEP aspect of the quadriceps tendon 
		- lowest fibers of the vastus intermedius = **articularis genus = lowest fibers on the knee**
			- will contract to **elevate the synovium during extension of leg at knee, prevention of synovium getting crushed by patella during extension**
	- quadriceps tendon = know it in lab separately!!!
	- quad tendon will go on to have the patellar ligament connection to the tibia 
- femoral nerve innervation of the atnerior compartment
- profunda femoris artery blood supply 
![[femoral triangle.jpeg]]
- sartorius = lat bound 
- iliopsoas/Pectineus = the floor of it 
- quads form the bulk of the anterior compartment
- with vastus intermedius deep and part of quads 

femoral nerve = will supply the anterior compartment
- between psoas major and iliacus muscles in the posterior abdominal wall 
- travels into **deep to the inguinal ligament, and then fanning out at the femoral triangle "witches broom"**
	- anterior division 
		- 2 cutaneous br - medial + intrmediate anterir cutaneous nn to thigh 
		- 2 motor br - muscular brs 
			- sartorius
			- pectineus 
	- posterior division 
		- 1 cutaneous br = **we need to see the saphenous nerve** , goes thru the subsartorius canal thru the knee, on its way to medial foot + leg 
		- 4 motor brs to the quadriceps. 
- patellar tendon reflex = **hits L2-4 , travels back via the femoral branches that supply here**

femoral artery = 
- abominal aorta divides into common iliacs, which divide into external + internal iliac
- external iliac = continues into anterior thigh = when emerges from the femoral triangle - **this is the femoral artery**
	- profunda femoris / deep femoral artery = the first br that comes out almost immediately 
		- medial circumflex femoral = portion of medial aspect of thigh AND head/neck of femur
		- lateral  circumflex femoral= 
		- 4 perforating br = bc they **perforate the adductor magnus to supply msucles of the posterior compartment**
	- descending genicular - blood to knee joint 
	- popliteal artery - adductor hiatus - **space inside the adductor magnus which allows the passage of** - femoral vessels -> to go thru the popliteal fossa, to become the popliteal artery 
		- 5 genicular br  to knee joints 
		- anterior tibial arteries 
		- posterior tibial arteries 
note = the femoral a largely gives supply to leg, not the thigh. note no branches util later 

NAV = lateral to medial in the femoral triangle
- femoral n
- femoral a 
- femoral v 
at point of the femoral triangle, lowest point = we see stacked femoral + profunda femoral vessels
- femoral artery 
- femoral v 
- profunda femoris a
- - profunda femoris v 
basically from top to bottom those are listed 

somewhere below the apex of the triangle, likely in the adductor canal, they are oriented to see the 
- femoral artery 
- femoral v 
- **adductus longus muscle, which will separate the stack**
- profunda femoris a
- - profunda femoris v 
femoral n will give nerve to the vastus medialis = will be straight to that muscle, down. 
saphenous nerve = cutaneous, passes thru adductor canal deep to the **vastoadductor membrane, which covers the adductor hiatus**
	this connects vastus medialis to the adductor magnus muscle 
	easily cut thru it, but the saphenous nerve passes deep to it ,
	continues bt tendons of sartorius + muscle called gracilis into the lower leg 

adductor canal - same thing as subsartorial canal
- from apex of femoral triangle to adductor hiatus within adductor magnus muscle
- for femoral vessels, saphenous n, n to vastus medialis 
bound = 
- vastus medialis anterior and laterial
- adductor longus + magnus posteriorly 
- sartorius = roof of canal 


---
medial compartment 
- for adduction + lateral rotation at hip 
5 muscles
- gracilis - intermediate layer 
	- just most medial of the intermeidate layer 
	- from ischiopubic ramus insert to superior part of medial surface of tibia 
	- this is a very weak adductor - you don't need it so you can use this for transplant 
- adductor longus  - **only superficial layer muscle**
	- fairly flat
	- from anterior surface of pubic bone 
	- insertion into middle 1/3 of linea aspera 
	- this tendon can get commonly ossified in horseback riders = "riders strain" - friction bt leg and saddle! 
- add brevis - intermediate layer 
	- immediately deep to adductor longus 
	- from inf pubic ramus to insert onto upper part of linea aspera superior to insertion of adductor longus 
- add magnus  - intermediate layer 
	- is very large, u can see it without reflecting longus 
	- origin= ischiopubic ramus + ischial tuberosity 
	- 2 parts 
		- adductor part = bigger, insertion of shaft of femur, linea aspera
		- hamstring part = by rounded tendon into adductor **tubercle** , more posterior? and going into more lower space 
		- **the gap bt these inserting fibers = adductor hiatus transmitting femoral vessels into popliteal fossa**
- obturator externus - **only deep layer muscle, reflect adductor brevis + pectineus to see this**
	- note, the obturator membrane has a canal, alowing for passage of obturator vessels + nerve 
	- most superior portion of the adductor magnus = adductor minimus (don't have to know the difference)
	- from outer surface of obturator memb + ischiopubic rami
	- inserts: passes inferior then posterior to hip joint to medial surface of greater trochanter
	- only **laterally rotates the thigh**
obturator nerve supply except 1/2 muscle 
- nerve enters medial thigh via the canal
- anterior br (in relation to **adductor brevis**)
	- deep to pectineus, anterior to add brevis
	- supplies **graciis, adductor brevis + longus, skin to medial thigh**
- posterior br (in relation to **adductor brevis**)
	- bt the adductor brevis + magnus 
	- supplies obturator externus, adductor magnus except hamstring , and brevis + skin to medial knee 
profunda femoris + obturator arteries 
- profunda femoris a 
	- medial circumflex femoral br 
	- muscular br
- obturator a
	- gives rise to actabular br to **supply the femoral head!!!**
lymphatic drainage to the internal iliac nodes + deep inguinal nodes 


---
posterior compartment
"hamstrings"
- to extend thigh at hip 
- flexes + rotates leg at knee
3 muscles
- biceps femoris =  most lateral 
	- long head from ischial tuberosity 
	- short head = from linea aspera and lateral supracondylar ridge of femur 
	- inserts onto the common tendon into head of the fibula = unique!
	- long head = extends thigh 
	- flexes + laterally rotates leg at knee 
- semimembranosus
	- ischial tuberosity origin
	- posterior part of medial condyle of tibia and as fibrous expansion to lateral femoral condyl insertion 
		- 	- almost reflects onto the lateral femoral condyle = like reinforces posterior knee 
	- most "meaty/large and the most medial"
- semitendonosus
	- ischial tuberosity origin
	- SUPER long tendon to upper medial shaft of tibia insertion 
all 3 originates from ischial tuberosity = can be an issue with avulsion injuries particularly with hurdlers  
- at full extension and then forcibly flex the knee, all the muscles can get ripped off of the ischial tubrosity 
sciatic nerve 
- long head of biceps femoris will be retracted 
- seee adductor magnus - which u can identify bc **there are so many perforating branches**
- see sciatic n running dep to long head of biceps and on posterior surface of adductor magnus dividing into 
	- tibial nerve = majority of posterior compartment, semimemb, semitend, long head of biceps and hamstring part of adductor magnus 
	- common fibular nerve  - supply to short head of biceps femoris on its **way to the lateral leg**
4 perforating br of profunda femoris 
- **perforate the adductor magnus**


---
popliteal fossa
- diamond shaped intermuscular space behind knee
bounds
- upper medial = semimembranosus, semitendinosus 
- upper lateral = long head of biceps femoris muscle 
- lower medial and lateral - corresponding heads of the gastrocnemius msucles
- roof = skin + superficial + deep fascia 

contents superficial (we see tibial n = medial, and common fibular n more lateral)
- tibial br = sural cutaneous nerve 
	- some controversy "medial sural cutaneous nerve? in textbooks"
- lateral sural cutaneous nerve from common fibular br 
- communicating br bt the 2 things 
- small saphenous vein = drains into popliteal vein where yu'll might see lymph nodes 

deeper contents of popliteal fossa 
- remove gastrocnemius muscls
- popliteal a and its genicular brs 
	- genicular aa (2 superior, 1 middle, 2 inf)
		- these all do the knee joint
		- middle goes straight down 
		- superior medial and superior lateral identiffication = id by locating superior heads of gastrocnemius muscle , which course right above their identifiable heads 
		- go to popliteius muscle to find the inferolaterl and medial vessels on the superior border of that. 
	- msucular branches - 
	- terminal brs 
		- at the inferior border of the popliteus muscle 
		- it deivides into anterior + posterior tibial artery 
- popliteal vein receiving that small saphenous vein 
- tibial nerve traveling further
- note = **common fibular nerve and the head of fibula = a very sensitive and fragile spot**
- floor of popliteal fossa
	- the oblique popiteal ligament = is a reflection of the **semi membranosus tendon!!!!!!**, reflects over to make the popliteal ligament, reinforcing that posterior capsule 
	- this separates the lateral meniscus of the knee 

lateral view of knee
- iliotibial tract (don't cut thru) inserts into the inferior border of knee
- lateral collateral ligament = fibular colalteral ligament
- head of the fibula + common fibular n = puts at risk of injury since it runs so superficial be weary of cutting it 

medial knee (from anterior to posterior)
- SGT!!! sargent 
- Sartorius 
- gracilis 
- semitendinosus 
- **medial knee has a muscle from each compartment inserting into there 0: **
	- pes anserinus= CT expansion of all 3 of these tendons, the foot of the goose, helps support medial knee 
	- ansrinal bursistis = the disease of which the bursa under the pes anserinus can get inflamed. 

very short SAM - and some amboss things
