pathology 
1. ==spina bifida - neural tube defect on posterior region-== 
	-  this tube doesn't go completely below the surface of embryo... so ==the tube doesn't close completely== 
	-  have parts of nervous system grow outside that area
	-  sclerotome cells can't migrate ovr and complete vertebral arch 
	1. **==myelo**schisis - cord exposed on surface, no meninges, no canal forming, severe functional deficits + or pre-mortum ... repairable but that kid would have lower extemity deficits== 
	2. ==spinal bifida occulta - normal function,== but noticeable manifestations with the canal not closing , basically it's where it's supposed to be j not complete closure, ==**tuft of hair or fat pad is external, small dimple that exists**==
	3. ==meningocele== - ==normal spinal cord, but swelling of meninges with CSF== thru the defect; repairable 
	4. ==meningo**myelocele==** - ==you have that meningeal outgrowth but **with the SC ):** , making it more defect, is repairable , done in utero prodominantly== 

lack of closing on neural tube on head
1. ==encephalocele - midline cranial bones fail to **ossify**, so the **meninges project out in a circle, with or without the brain tissue; its fine.==**. sometimes repairable. remove that dead brain tissue on the inside f that. doesn't impact mortality much. 
2. ==anecephaly - more extreme, common in stillborns, terminal, extreme neural tube defect, **anterior neuropore cannot close - brain + neurocranium absent** + born **without** cerebrum== 
3. =**==arnold-chiari malformation** - part of **cerebellum + medulla herniate thru foramen magnum**, this blocking CSF flow ... some are asymptomatic and some are severe== impacts on function or CSF flow. ==type 2 of this is associated with **meningomyelocele**==, since type 2 is it herniating into the back of the head, and then the cord herniates thru with the meningomyelocele ...

==PATHO: **pick's disease - with frontotemporal degen or dementia, resulting in complex personality changes + working memory deficits** - predom the frontal and temporal cortices==

path: alz dz = irreversible, **loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons so has to do with ACH in the brain**

myelin disorders
1. hypomyelination - failure to form during dev
2. demyelination - breakdown of normal myelin after formation 
	1. primary - caused by direct dmg to myelin sheath or myelin forming cells
	2. secondary - happens ***following degen of axons*** - axons and myelin are mutually dependent. 
	3. ==acquired autoimmune + infectious dz = **multiple sclerosis**==
	4. ==genetic dz = leukodystrophies, refsum's dz (can't break down brached chain FA, accumulations of these in cells), phenylketonuria==
	5. toxic + nutritional dz = lead poisoning 
		1. nutritional: ==vitamin B12== likely would be huge ; neurological symptoms are huge , dx by **inc ==anti-intrinsic factor antibodies==, can't absorb b12 due to the parietal cells, like in autoimmune atrophic gastritis**
			1. single methyl donor reactions in the white matter cause this
			2. don't have that SAM being made in the body, so catecholamines + making of the sheaths are not there. 
			3. and B9 if there's no neurological symptoms 
	6. dz primarily affecting neurons with secondary involvment of myelin: mechanical trauma, infarc, tumors, **lysosomal storage dz**
		1. our neurons are mainly affected by lysosomal storage bc they're meant to be longterm cells with longterm dmg and are dependent on natural turnover of any dmg'd structures
		2. ==primary lysosomal HYDROLASE defect - biggest thing - recall that these are meant to break down and clear sphingolipids. most common.== 
		3. acid alpha glucosidase = **pompe's dz**
		4. ==alpha - L - iduronidase **hurler's** AR - coarse facial features, corneal clouding==
		5. ==idursulfase **hunters dz X linked** - aggressiveness==
list of storage dz!!! for **defects in sphingolipid metabolism**
3. fabry dz = alpha-galactosidase A def, , will accumulate **ceramide trihexoside** = **only one that's x linked here, all else is AR**
	1. 2 gal and 1 glucose to a ceramide = ceramide trihexoside.... supposed to make lactosylcerebroside. 
	2. basicallly will lead to ==**full bod / localized pain, peripheral neuropath**y, **angiokeratoma**, hypohidrosis== - nerve detachment from sweat glands, kidney failure, cardiomyopathy 
	3. **see ==kidney== failures, 16 years expectancy in males, kidney cells are most impacted**
4. gaucher dz - glucocrebrosidase defect, makes **gluco**cerebrooside accumulation 
	1. lactosylcerebroside -> **glucocerebroside**, which u have to try taking that Glc off to make ceramide again 
	2. 3 forms: non-neuronopathic type 1 , acute infantile neuropathic type 2 , and chronic neuronopathic type 3 
	3. **==hepatosplenomegaly==, ==bone pain==, osteoporosis, anemia + neuro symptoms**
	4. these are common, enzyme replacement thrapy, appearance of this **macrophages that look like ==crumpled tissue paper==.** this is due to glucose accumulation in the macrophages 
	5. type 2 = end up in die by age 2 
5. niemann-pick dz - sphingomyelinase - makes a==ccumulate sphingomyelin== 
	1. 2 forms - type a classic infantile and type b visceral 
	2. **cherry red spot on retina , ==foam cells,== ==hepatosplenomegaly==** and ofc neurodegen. - cherry due to the accumulation of sphingomylin, and the foam cells are due to the **lipid laden environment!!!** -> foam cells make hepatosplenomegaly accumulation 
	3. the ppl with type A would die in the first 2 years 
6. tay-sachs - ==hexosaminidase== A - a==ccumulate GM2 ganglioside==
	1. supposed to be broken down from GM2 to GM3.... supposed to remove GALNAC not the sialsilic acid 
	2. 3 forms = infantile, juvenile, adult/late onset 
	3. ==**onion skin== appearance in lysosomes!**
	4. cherry red spot on retina, **developmental delays, and psychomotor stuff - ==NO HEPATOMEGALY!** - no foam cellls !==
	5. kids with infantile form die in 2-3 years and then go blind first 
7. krabbe dz - beta-==galacto==cerebrosidase, accumulates ==galactocerebroside== 
	1. ==first, sulfatide gets broken into galactocerebroside.== 
	2. but can't make into ceramide from there, can't remove galactose. 
	3. buildup of this, which is a **toxic metabolite.**
	4. ==accumulation of galactocerebroside -> makes **psychosine, neurotoxin!!!**==
	5. progression will cause ==degen== of motor skills, 3-6 months after birth with fever, sizures, muscle weakness, vision loss + slowing development
	6. ==**low white cells**==
	7. ==**globoid cells = occur in brain tissu,e a cell with a whiter rim around it**==
8. ==metachromatic leukodystrophy - arylsulfatase== - accumulates ==cerebroside sulfate== 
	1. remove sulfate off the sulfatide, making galactocerebroside is normal 
	2. now that we dont' have that 
	3. ==**central + peripheral demylination**==
	4. late infantile, juvenile, adults
	5. ==symptoms happen after 1st yar of life.==

syringomyelia - cyst grows at the central canal at the spinal cord 
- **enlargement of that central canal of spinal cord**
- gray matter, horns displaced more lateral
- **loss of pain + temperature sensation bilaterally from ==ARMS==**
- ==legs and trunk stay normal in pain and temp -== 
- ==recall: the dorsal horns for the ALS needs to send that neurons **across the gray matter to the other side**==
- normal dorsal column medial meniscus bc it's not crossing the entire gray matter from the dorsal horn at the entry of the SC, will instead go to the dorsal column 
	==touch, proprioception, vibraiton, etc will not be impacted, except maybe==
	- ==weakened motor control slightly below lesion tho== 
- ultimately this can be fixed....

neuropathic pain + pain disorders
- hyperactivity of neurons associated in pain pathways - in the absence of nociceptor stimulation 
- usually stabbing, burning quality

pathology: 
vestibular system disorders
 - any peripheral vestibuar disorder - anything out side of the brain stem like with vestibular nervee or inner ear structures
 - Central vestibular disorders - of the CNS that help process blaance + spatial info (brainstem, vestibular nuc, cortex, cerebellum)
 - dizziness, vertigo(spinning + persception of movement of self/surrounding objs is bad, need to be in a dark quiet room), disequilibrium(unsteadiness, imbalance, loss due to spatial disorientation, need ambulatory aid)
 - all accompanied with problems with balance + spatial orientation.
 - sensitive in changes to walking surfaces ): downtown charleston very dangerous 
1. ==meniere's disease - **accumulation of water** in the origin of balance, in the vestibular system, **sudden rise in pressure of ear, only in the affected ear**==
	1. no exact cause, but stress + viral infection considered
	2. sudden onset - vertigo with above the heart, sweating + vomiting for a few min to several hours. 
	3. tinnitis in one ear + hearing difficulties. bt attacks, tho balance is normal **but hearing loss can persist**
	4. ==give low sodium diet, no cafffiene, tobacco, chocolate.== 
	5. treat with motion sickness/anti nausea meds + vestibular rehab.
