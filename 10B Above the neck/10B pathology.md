pathology 
1. ==spina bifida - neural tube defect on posterior region-== 
	-  this tube doesn't go completely below the surface of embryo... so ==the tube doesn't close completely== 
	-  have parts of nervous system grow outside that area
	-  sclerotome cells can't migrate ovr and complete vertebral arch 
	1. ==myeloschisis - cord exposed on surface, no meninges, no canal forming, severe functional deficits + or pre-mortum ... repairable but that kid would have lower extemity deficits== 
	2. ==spinal bifida occulta - normal function,== but noticeable manifestations with the canal not closing , basically it's where it's supposed to be j not complete closure, ==**tuft of hair or fat pad is external, small dimple that exists**==
	3. ==meningocele== - ==normal spinal cord, but swelling of meninges with CSF== thru the defect; repairable 
	4. ==meningomyelocele== - ==you have that meningeal outgrowth but **with the SC ):** , making it more defect, is repairable , done in utero prodominantly== 

lack of closing on neural tube on head
1. ==encephalocele - midline cranial bones fail to ossify, so the meninges project out in a circle, with or without the brain tissue; its fine.==. sometimes repairable. remove that dead brain tissue on the inside f that. doesn't impact mortality much. 
2. ==anecephaly - more extreme, common in stillborns, terminal, extreme neural tube defect, **anterior neuropore cannot close - brain + neurocranium absent** + born without cerebrum== 
3. ==arnold-chiari malformation - part of **cerebellum + medulla herniate thru foramen magnum**, this blocks CSF flow ... some are asymptomatic and some are severe== impacts on function or CSF flow. ==type 2 of this is associated with meningomyelocele==, since type 2 is it herniating into the back of the head, and then the cord herniates thru with the meningomyelocele ...

==PATHO: **pick's disease - with frontotemporal degen or dementia, resulting in complex personality changes + working memory deficits** - predom the frontal and temporal cortices==

path: alz dz = irreversible, **loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons so has to do with ACH in the brain**

myelin disorders
1. hypomyelination - failure to form during dev
2. demyelination - breakdown of normal myelin after formation 
	1. primary - caused by direct dmg to myelin sheath or myelin forming cells
	2. secondary - happens ***following degen of axons*** - axons and myelin are mutually dependent. 
	3. acquired autoimmune + infectious dz = **multiple sclerosis**
	4. genetic dz = leukodystrophies, refsum's dz (can't break down brached chain FA, accumulations of these in cells), phenylketonuria
	5. toxic + nutritional dz = lead poisoning 
		1. nutritional: vitamin B12 likely would be huge ; neurological symptoms are huge , dx by **inc anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, can't absorb b12 due to the parietal cells, like in autoimmune atrophic gastritis**
			1. single methyl donor reactions in the white matter cause this
			2. don't have that SAM being made in the body, so catecholamines + making of the sheaths are not there. 
			3. and B9 if there's no neurological symptoms 
	6. dz primarily affecting neurons with secondary involvment of myelin: mechanical trauma, infarc, tumors, **lysosomal storage dz**
		1. our neurons are mainly affected by lysosomal storage bc they're meant to be longterm cells with longterm dmg and are dependent on natural turnover of any dmg'd structures
		2. primary lysosomal HYDROLASE defect - biggest thing - recall that these are meant to break down and clear sphingolipids. most common. 
		3. acid alpha glucosidase = **pompe's dz**
		4. alpha - L - iduronidase **hurler's**
		5. idursulfase **hunters dz**
