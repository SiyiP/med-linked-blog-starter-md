pathology 
1. ==spina bifida - neural tube defect on posterior region-== 
	-  this tube doesn't go completely below the surface of embryo... so ==the tube doesn't close completely== 
	-  have parts of nervous system grow outside that area
	-  sclerotome cells can't migrate ovr and complete vertebral arch 
	1. ==myeloschisis - cord exposed on surface, no meninges, no canal forming, severe functional deficits + or pre-mortum ... repairable but that kid would have lower extemity deficits== 
	2. ==spinal bifida occulta - normal function,== but noticeable manifestations with the canal not closing , basically it's where it's supposed to be j not complete closure, ==**tuft of hair or fat pad is external, small dimple that exists**==
	3. ==meningocele== - ==normal spinal cord, but swelling of meninges with CSF== thru the defect; repairable 
	4. ==meningomyelocele== - ==you have that meningeal outgrowth but **with the SC ):** , making it more defect, is repairable , done in utero prodominantly== 

lack of closing on neural tube on head
1. ==encephalocele - midline cranial bones fail to ossify, so the meninges project out in a circle, with or without the brain tissue; its fine.==. sometimes repairable. remove that dead brain tissue on the inside f that. doesn't impact mortality much. 
2. ==anecephaly - more extreme, common in stillborns, terminal, extreme neural tube defect, **anterior neuropore cannot close - brain + neurocranium absent** + born without cerebrum== 
3. ==arnold-chiari malformation - part of **cerebellum + medulla herniate thru foramen magnum**, this blocks CSF flow ... some are asymptomatic and some are severe== impacts on function or CSF flow. ==type 2 of this is associated with meningomyelocele==, since type 2 is it herniating into the back of the head, and then the cord herniates thru with the meningomyelocele ...

==PATHO: **pick's disease - with frontotemporal degen or dementia, resulting in complex personality changes + working memory deficits** - predom the frontal and temporal cortices==
