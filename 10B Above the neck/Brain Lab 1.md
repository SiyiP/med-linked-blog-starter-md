spinal cord - questions to ask?
- covered in dura?
- 3 meninges surrounding it
- denticulate ligs = pia extending to dura 
- filum terminale 
- cauda equina 
trace "rostrally - toowards the top of the spinal cord, to the brain" 
- lumbar enlargement - lumbar and sacral plexuses 
- cervical enlargement - BP origin 
externally - see the anterior median fissure with ant spinal artery 
anterior roots attached on either sides of the anterior roots, motor stufff? 
flip to posterior see
- posterior dorsal columns = ridge of white matter 
- post spinal aa + roots
see small blood vessels adhering to the cord. anterior = midline vessel and posterior paired. 


id meninges of brain 
- dura = see folds of dura falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli between portions of forebrain. 
- subarachnoid space will widen into cisterns at severeal poitns bc arachnoid doesn't faithfully follow brain surface contours. 
- pia mater - displays greatly the contours of the CNS. 
- sulcus = inward
- convexity = gyrus 
lateral sylvian fissure bt temporal lobe + frontal/parietal . encloses the **insula if you gently open it**
central sulcus - runs sinusoidal course vertically, in front is the frontal lobe, behind is the parietal 


- precentral and postcentral gyruses - in front and behind the central sulcus 
- parietal lobe will be stopped at the parieto-occipital sulvucs above the preoccipital notch to mark this boundary . 

there's a half brain! 
- corpus callosum -  fiber fbundle connection 
- anterior commissure connects corrtex of 2 temporal lobes - a dot under the acorpus allosum's front?
