spinal cord - questions to ask?
- covered in dura?
- 3 meninges surrounding it
- denticulate ligs = pia extending to dura 
- filum terminale 
- cauda equina 
trace "rostrally - toowards the top of the spinal cord, to the brain" 
- lumbar enlargement - lumbar and sacral plexuses 
- cervical enlargement - BP origin 
externally - see the anterior median fissure with ant spinal artery  - The anterior spinal artery provides blood to the ventral & lateral columns, ventral horns, and upper portion of dorsal horns.

anterior roots attached on either sides of the anterior roots, motor stufff? 
flip to posterior see
- posterior dorsal columns = ridge of white matter 
- post spinal aa + roots
see small blood vessels adhering to the cord. anterior = midline vessel and posterior paired. 


id meninges of brain 
- dura = see folds of dura falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli between portions of forebrain. 
- subarachnoid space will widen into cisterns at severeal poitns bc arachnoid doesn't faithfully follow brain surface contours. 
- pia mater - displays greatly the contours of the CNS. 
- sulcus = inward
- convexity = gyrus 
lateral sylvian fissure bt temporal lobe + frontal/parietal . encloses the **insula if you gently open it**
central sulcus - runs sinusoidal course vertically, in front is the frontal lobe, behind is the parietal 


- precentral and postcentral gyruses - in front and behind the central sulcus 
- parietal lobe will be stopped at the parieto-occipital sulvucs above the preoccipital notch to mark this boundary . 

there's a half brain! 
- corpus callosum -  fiber fbundle connection 
- anterior commissure connects corrtex of 2 temporal lobes - a **dot** under the corpus callosum's front? 
- fornix - column seen.... fiber traveling bt hppoampal complex in temporal lobe + number f ventral structure s- smaller c curve under te corpus callosum 
	- this is suspended form under the corpus callosum with the septum pellucidum - very vasculature 
you see that the preparer's knife has passed through the space of the tall,  
narrow third ventricle which lies on the midline of the diencephalon. It thus creates a right and left  
thalamus and hypothalamus that are mirror images of one another 
- small disc like interthalamic adhesion across thst third ventricle. - sliced thru and we can see the canal of CSF from latera ventrical into the third = interventricular foamen. 
- aqueduct is a tube through the midbrain which conveniently separates the dorsal part or  tectum from the ventral part or tegmentum. The tectum is made up of two bumps, one in front of the  
other, the superior and inferior colliculi
- The occipital lobe contains the primary visual cortex. Most of the visual cortex lies on the  
medial side and is buried in the deep calcarine sulcus
- deep parieto-occipital sulcus is on the  
medial wall of the hemisphere and it converges with the horizontally running calcarine sulcus

prominent gyrus just above and running parallel to the corpus callosum is called the cingulate gyrus

![[lateral brain.jpeg]]

A - caudate - inside lateral ventricle  
B = interthalamic adhesion 
C = pineal gland 
D = optic chiasm 
E = thalamus - is to the back of the intraventricular foramen/foramen of monro? 
F = mamillary body 
G = superior colliculus 

pons = the larger one on the stem
medulla - the smaller wedge underneath 
third ventricle is on the underside of the thalamus???
cerebral aqueduct = connection to the cerebellum, midbrain side
fourth ventricle - the small blob beflore the cerebellum 

![[brain dorsal.png]]
ventral brain
A. olfactory tract
B - optic tchiasm 
C - optic tract
D mamillary body 
E cerebral peduncle 
F = pons
G medullary pyramid
H cerebellum
