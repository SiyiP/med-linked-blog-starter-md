lecture stuff
- gray matter shows cell bodies
- gray matter region - the part witout all the white blobs
- this is detected with a myelin stain, so only the white matter is labeled. other thing that is abeled = the other things in the picture are oligodendrites. 
- neuroglia = support cells 
- nissl - RER in a neuron bc it's responsible for its own protein synthesis 
- dendrites = many br, tapreing contain SPINEs. we can have many in each thing. 
- if you have dmg to the dendritic spines, dec in synaptic transmission - many receptors are there. 
- purkinje cells - **prodominantly GABA, major inhibitory NTs.** - heavily found in cerebellum, helps out wit balalnce and stuff
near the dorsal root ganglion - *pseudounipolar*, surrounded by satellite cells 
- one br into periphery other br into the CNS. 

autnomic ganglion - found multipolar cells, huge impacts on the visceral motor functions 

- When there are more than three processes a neuron is called multipolar (most neurons are multipolar)
- - Cresyl violet stains the rough endoplasmic reticulum of neurons which has a clumpy appearance.  These are called Nissl bodies.
	- Nissl bodies (RER) are dense in the cell body (soma).  Less RER extends into the dendrites.  Axons have no RER.- **this is splotchy purple inside the cell body**
	there will be many small nucle**i around the neuron body** - The many small nuclei around this cell are likely to belong to glial cells.
- Dendrites receive input from neighboring neurons. They contain spines that are small lateral projections along the dendrite shaft and are associated with synaptic contacts.

about dendritic spines
-  Presynaptic receptors are typically located on axons. Axons do not contain spiny shafts.
- they instad will contain postsynaptic receptors

A =  pseudounipolar neuron
B,C,D = multipolar due to the vast branching that is occurring.  
- C is considered multipolar bc of the dense arborization of the dendrites, rather than number of processes stemming from the cell body.  The arborization of the dendrites can start to occur at the level of the cell body, which can and do look like many-poles off the cell body.
E = bipolar neuron
![[nerve bundle crosssection.jpeg]]Dorsal root ganglion cells are sensory neurons which differentiate from the neural crest.
- the dorsal root ganglion cell =pseudounipolar - The two processes fused close to the cell body.    The adult cell has a single process leaving the cell body which then bifurcates into a branch that travels peripherally to respond to sensory stimulation, and a branch that travels centrally into the spinal cord.  Both branches are morphologically and functionally (voltage-gated Na & K channels) specialized as an axon.

Autonomic/visceral motor information is transmitted via autonomic ganglia.

 At the nodes of Ranvier the axon is bare (unmyelinated) and contains many voltage-gated Na & K channels
-  Each Schwann cell myelinates one internode on one axon only (one Schwann cell forms one myelin segment)

PNS schwann cells not only myelinate axons, but they will also be loosely associated with unmyelinated axons to provide 'glial' like support.

CNS oligodendrocyte can myelinate several axons.

Support cells in the nervous system provide a means of nutritional support, defense, and insulation of target signals.  
-Schwann cells  - myelination in the peripheral nervous system, myelinates a single axon only  
-Oligodendrocytes - myelination in the central nervous system, **myelinate multiple axons**  
-Astrocytes - provide support as well as creation of the blood brain barrier (capillary end feet)  
	activate + prooliferate following brain injury making a glial scar
	maintain ion homeo around neurons 
	remove + recycle NTs
	look like a little sun 
satellite cells - near the dorsal root ganglia
-Microglia - functional white blood cell of the central nervous system, provides defense as well as recruitment of other immune components during injury and infection - looks like little stars almost at rest, bristled starfish. 
- **Resting state microglia morphologically have a small cell body and long processes**

plasticity of the nervous system is due to - Dendritic spines can increase in number relatively quickly, increasing points of contact between a “sending” neuron and a “receiving” neuron.  This can dramatically increase the efficiency of transferred chemical signals - providing a rapid means of “learning” in the nervous system.


in the CNS: Microglia act as resident macrophages. Ependymal cells line the ventricular cavities of the CNS. Oligos myelinate axons.


- Specialized ependymal cells form choroid plexus (with loops of brain capillaries)

Each Schwann cell produces only a piece of myelin on the axon of a PNS nerve fiber.  Therefore, if a single Schwann cell is destroyed due to injury, the remaining Schwann cells can act as support and guidance for a regenerating peripheral nerve. 
However, oligodendrocytes myelinate many axons in the CNS, and actually secrete nerve growth inhibiting factors to reduce regrowth of CNS neurons.  Therefore, nerve damage in the CNS is much less likely to be able to repair itself than nerve damage in the PNS.



**Sacral** cord has a lot of gray matter with a thin rim of white matter. Most descending axons have synapsed before sacral level and few ascending axons have entered.
