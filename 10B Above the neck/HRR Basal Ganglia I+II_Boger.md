should be able to isolate that lesion and make some thought son it 

basal ganglia - diverse, lies deep within cerebral hemispheres
- no genesis of movement
- sending to the **upper motor neurons, regulating their upper motor neuron circuits**

get familiar: to a coronal secition of the brain + brainstem 
- caudate = landmark - the head of it is antreriormost in brain - makes up the **wall of lateral ventricle lateral wall**
	- the body of the caudate nucleus travels **above** the thalamus, and smaller and ends after it. 
- separated by internal capsule (**anterior limb is siemese twin like look at this**, and you can assume it's still anterior bc otherwise you'll see the thalamus at midline)
	- posterior limb of the internal capsule would be 
- putamen - ventral and lateral to the caudate 
	- **upon analysis, caudate + putamen are TWINS, separated at birth, our two big input zones.** the striatum
	- putamen gets more lteral and bigger in size when moving posterior. 
- output segmnents:
	- globus pallidus - in brain - ventral and medial to putamen. 
		- more lateral = external - more a triangular shape
		- internal = more medial 
			- regulates movements below the neck 
	- substantia nigra pars compacta - in midbrain = **has the dopamine cell bodies!**
	- substantia nigra pars reticulata - **anterior to the compacta**
		- has the GABAergic cells, sending out information to control with **head and neck movements!!!!**

basal ganglia circuitry 
afferents/inputs , which all convrge on the striatum, the caudate + putamen 

major driving factor of basal ganglia - from the cortex - **excitatory neurons from most areas of cortex that release glutamate is major**
less big input as modulatory neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain that release dopamine and then terminate in the striatum. 
- dopamine = modulatory - both excite + inhib effects. modulating that glutamatergic input 
when neurons get into the basal ganglia...
- axons will synapse on the **medium spiny neurons!!!**
	- many dendrites here. 
	- large dendritic trees allow for **a lot o collection + integration of many inputs**
	- the cortex, SN and local interneurons modulate activity of these on the striatum 
	- then they send projections of **GABA to the globus pallucis and substantia nigra pars reticulata (major output site**)

intrinsic circuitry + efferents
- inclusive of caudate + putamen - releases **gaba, inibitory between each other**
- the globus pallidis internal segment will give out to the globus pallidis external one. 

excitatory neurons that release glutamate:
- thalamus will send this motor output signals to the cortical areas, 
- subthalamic nucleus, underneath will get information from the **globus pallucidis external segment -> stop pathway... making the indirect pathway**
	- subthalamic nuc release glutamate
maor outputs from basal ganglia
- via the GPi -= movement below the neck 
- via SNpr - movement above the neck. 

caudate and putamate -> inhibitory output into the SN pars reticulata and globus pallidus internal 
- the globus pallidus internal  then sends inhibitory regulations out to the thalamus , the VA/VL complex, so will **not move. thalamus not fire = no movement**
- if the globus pallidus internal was turned **off, it would have the VA/VL thalamus copmlex fire off to frontal cortex, allowing movement**.
- SN pars reticulata, so releases BAGA downstream to inhibit the superior collicuus, inhibiting movement from above the neck!\
	- and when the SN pars reticulata is inhibited itself,  the superior colliculus would fire, allowing for secadic eye movements 

disinhibitory circuit - unique to cerebellum + basal ganglia 
- if you have 2 GABA side by side, you would inhibit the inhibition of the downstream nuclei 
- at rest = striatum is silent 
- but at rest, the **globus pallidus is tonically active, will fire tonically** -> release **GABA to INHIBIT the thalamus!**
- bc thalamus is inhibited, no activity of the motor cortex 
- but if the **striatum is activated wiht stimulation...**
	- you activate those spiny neurons, which will fire off the **GABA**... into the globus pallidus 
	- inhibiting the globus pallidus internal 
	- no w there's **no inhibitory GABAs that are going ot the thalamus, now we can get more information from other structures into the thalamus to activate it**
	- activation of the motor cortex, release of the inhibition of the thalamus -> glutamate to the cortex therefore movement facilitation 
disinhibition of suprior colliculus - **contributes to eye movement regulation**
- when eyes are fixated on a targt... since ur not moving it, the caudate is silent, so the pars reticulata is tonically active, which inhibits the **superior colliculus.**
- but then if you start moving the eyes, caudate will fire, inhibition of the pars reticulata, 
- allowing the **superior colliculus to fire, allowing for saccadic eye movement.**

direct + indirect pathways of the basal ganglia ... 
- note - yes the major input ot the basal ganglia is from the cortex via glutamate. 
- this glutamate could activate either and at the same time: the direct / go pathway - to **do volitional movement, disinhibition of the thalamus,**
- indirect pathway - stop pathway 
	- inhibit **unwanted movements!! inc tonic inhibition of thalamus mediated via globus pallucidis internus**
these pathways work together - you point by go pathway that pointer, and then stop pathway everything else 


direct - input directly to regulate the thalamus 
indirect - bc the caudate / putamen will signal other nuclei to then impact the thalamus
