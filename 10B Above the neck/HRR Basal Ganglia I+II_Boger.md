#sensorimotor 

should be able to isolate that lesion and make some thought son it 

basal ganglia - diverse, lies deep within cerebral hemispheres
- no genesis of movement
- sending to the **upper motor neurons, regulating their upper motor neuron circuits**

get familiar: to a coronal secition of the brain + brainstem 
- caudate = landmark - the head of it is antreriormost in brain - makes up the **wall of lateral ventricle lateral wall**
	- the body of the caudate nucleus travels **above** the thalamus, and smaller and ends after it. 
- separated by internal capsule (**anterior limb is siemese twin like look at this**, and you can assume it's still anterior bc otherwise you'll see the thalamus at midline)
	- posterior limb of the internal capsule would be 
- putamen - ventral and lateral to the caudate 
	- **upon analysis, caudate + putamen are TWINS, separated at birth, our two big input zones.** the striatum
	- putamen gets more lteral and bigger in size when moving posterior. 
- output segmnents:
	- globus pallidus - in brain - ventral and medial to putamen. 
		- more lateral = external - more a triangular shape
		- internal = more medial 
			- regulates movements below the neck 
	- substantia nigra pars compacta - in midbrain = **has the dopamine cell bodies!**
	- substantia nigra pars reticulata - **anterior to the compacta**
		- has the GABAergic cells, sending out information to control with **head and neck movements!!!!**

basal ganglia circuitry 
afferents/inputs , which all convrge on the striatum, the caudate + putamen 

major driving factor of basal ganglia - from the cortex - **excitatory neurons from most areas of cortex that release glutamate is major**
less big input as modulatory neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain that release dopamine and then terminate in the striatum. 
- dopamine = modulatory - both excite + inhib effects. modulating that glutamatergic input 
when neurons get into the basal ganglia...
- axons will synapse on the **medium spiny neurons!!!**
	- many dendrites here. 
	- large dendritic trees allow for **a lot o collection + integration of many inputs**
	- the cortex, SN and local interneurons modulate activity of these on the striatum 
	- then they send projections of **GABA to the globus pallucis and substantia nigra pars reticulata (major output site**)

intrinsic circuitry + efferents
- inclusive of caudate + putamen - releases **gaba, inibitory between each other**
- the globus pallidis internal segment will give out to the globus pallidis external one. 

excitatory neurons that release glutamate:
- thalamus will send this motor output signals to the cortical areas, 
- subthalamic nucleus, underneath will get information from the **globus pallucidis external segment -> stop pathway... making the indirect pathway**
	- subthalamic nuc release glutamate
maor outputs from basal ganglia
- via the GPi -= movement below the neck 
- via SNpr - movement above the neck. 

caudate and putamate -> inhibitory output into the SN pars reticulata and globus pallidus internal 
- the globus pallidus internal  then sends inhibitory regulations out to the thalamus , the VA/VL complex, so will **not move. thalamus not fire = no movement**
- if the globus pallidus internal was turned **off, it would have the VA/VL thalamus copmlex fire off to frontal cortex, allowing movement**.
- SN pars reticulata, so releases BAGA downstream to inhibit the superior collicuus, inhibiting movement from above the neck!\
	- and when the SN pars reticulata is inhibited itself,  the superior colliculus would fire, allowing for secadic eye movements 

disinhibitory circuit - unique to cerebellum + basal ganglia 
- if you have 2 GABA side by side, you would inhibit the inhibition of the downstream nuclei 
- at rest = striatum is silent 
- but at rest, the **globus pallidus is tonically active, will fire tonically** -> release **GABA to INHIBIT the thalamus!**
- bc thalamus is inhibited, no activity of the motor cortex 
- but if the **striatum is activated wiht stimulation...**
	- you activate those spiny neurons, which will fire off the **GABA**... into the globus pallidus 
	- inhibiting the globus pallidus internal 
	- no w there's **no inhibitory GABAs that are going ot the thalamus, now we can get more information from other structures into the thalamus to activate it**
	- activation of the motor cortex, release of the inhibition of the thalamus -> glutamate to the cortex therefore movement facilitation 
disinhibition of suprior colliculus - **contributes to eye movement regulation**
- when eyes are fixated on a targt... since ur not moving it, the caudate is silent, so the pars reticulata is tonically active, which inhibits the **superior colliculus.**
- but then if you start moving the eyes, caudate will fire, inhibition of the pars reticulata, 
- allowing the **superior colliculus to fire, allowing for saccadic eye movement.**

direct + indirect pathways of the basal ganglia ... 
- note - yes the major input ot the basal ganglia is from the cortex via glutamate. 
- this glutamate could activate either and at the same time: the direct / go pathway - to **do volitional movement, disinhibition of the thalamus,**
- indirect pathway - stop pathway 
	- inhibit **unwanted movements!! inc tonic inhibition of thalamus mediated via globus pallucidis internus**
these pathways work together - you point by go pathway that pointer, and then stop pathway everything else 
big note - **GP will tonically fire AT REST, inhibiting the thalamus with GABA**


direct - input directly to regulate the thalamus 
indirect - bc the caudate / putamen will signal other nuclei to then impact the thalamus 
- facilitate movement 
1. behavioral stimuli 
2. SN pars compacta releases dopamine!!! D1
3. DA will bind to the D1 receptors in the striatal medium spinal neurons, and thus stimulating them ; D1R + DA -> **excitatory**
4. medium spinal neurons of the striatum will release GABA into the globus pallidus internal, inhbiiting it 
5. bc of that... the VA/VL complex of the thalamus would **be disinhibited, releasing glut into the cortex = voluntary movement**

parkingsons is with the dopamine cell knockout.. keep that in mind. slow and not rearing up 
- if the activation of the D1R happen, we see reduction of parkingsons symptoms , rearing up 


indirect pathway - inhibit  unwanted movemnts, the stop pathway. 
1. behavioral stimuli 
2. SN pars compacta release DA into the striatum 
3. **instead, DA binds the D2R!!! on striatal medium spiney neurons, inhibiting them** so its NOT r***eleasing GABA into the globus pallidus externus*** 
	1. DA + D2R = inhibition 
4. typically, the globus pallidus **externus** would be inhibited but now will be allowed for it to **tonically fire!!! releasing GABA into the SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS** = tonic firing 
5. STN will be inhibited!!! by lots of GABA released here
6. STN will release NO glutamate into the globus pallidus internal segment. = **the globus pallidus internal is inhibited here.**
	1. ==No input to the GPi (consider it at rest, bc under no NT influence) means the GPi will continue to tonically fire.==Â 
7. Globus pallidus internal segment will CONTINUE to release GABA... to the thalamus 
8. Thalamus tonic firing of the GPi is ==releasing enough GABA into the thalamus to inhibit the thalamus..==.the inhibition of the thalamus means NO glutamate will be released in the cortex...thus NO movement!
![[basal ganglia indirect and direct pathways.png]]

**The key is remembering that at rest (or under ==no== upstream influence) the GP will tonically fire, causing inhibition of innervated nuclei, in this case the thalamus.**


center-surround functional organization of direct + indirect pathways
- direct = **more central in the cylinder , via caudate/putamin**
	- very **focal disinhibition of the thalamus**
- indirect = more of a wider influence, so it'll surround the direct cyinder. 
	- very suppression and global suppression ... 

basal ganglia motor + non-motor loops (learn more abt these in subsequent blocks)
- we do have these loops that are there that impact body, mind, emotion/affect. 
- oculomotor loop - with intent of communcating back tot he cortex 
- and limbic loop = cortical regions with diff subcortical nuclei, parallell to the motor pathways 


parkinson's dz 
- hypokinetic movement disorder
- bradykinesia (slow movements), rigidity (stiff) , tremor AT REST - pill rolling strting in the hand
- postural instability (imbalance)

parkinson's dz = **significant loss of dopamine cells in that substantia nigra.**
- seen with the eye 
- typically they los 80% of these cells before they get symptoms. 
- fluorodopa taken up wayyy less, not lighting anything up at all in imaging 
- basically **reduction of dopamine into the caudate putamen**
	you also see **an upregulation of D2 receptors, so more of that upreg of indirect pathway, the stopping**
lewy body disease 

deep brain stimulation DBS - can implant electrodes to try and mask the symptoms by doing firing. 
implant electrode into the brain. physician preference, run wire into the generators and then regulate this to normalize motor function and firing. 

in animal models of parkinsons' 
- MPTP = dopamine neurotoxin injections into animals
- irregular bursting pattern = **with parkinsons, GPI irregular bursting of them**
- regular discharge of GPI normalized during STN stimulation
	- so if you stimulate the subthalamic nucleus thru DBS,,,, the globus pallucidis interna will regularly discharge now. aka -NORMALIZED THE MOVEMENTS??///**

huntington's dz = **hyperkinetic**
- progressive debilitating - 
- spontaneous invo movements, dancelike/choreiform movements
- progressive behavioral changes + dementia 
- only symptomatic treatment ): 
- **on chromosome 4 + encodes a cytoplasmic protein huntintin of unknown function**
	- expansion o CAG that codes for glutamine
	- more triplicates = more risk of getting it 
	- ==the brain = has significant atrophy of caudate and striatal structures== 
	- dementia = atrophy 
**the D2 contianing medium spiney neurons die off first!!!** = indirect one being TURNED OFF = no stop signals vs start 
- direct pathway upregulation.
