#sensorimotor 

orientation 
evertyhing above brainstem: **close to face. and ventral = close to belly/down. caudal inferior, dorsal up top**
rostral in **brainstem = top**, dorsal near our back, caudal is down aka towards the tail, ventral is towards the face. 
- it's like we rotated the axis on the brain downards!!!
![[brain v brainstem neuroanatomical orientation]]

**evreything posterior is sensory.**
everything anterior = motor. 
	sulcus luminance - generate autonomic nervous system, n the spinal cord in between anterior horn and posterior horn
	- at that cranial + sacral level, u just have parasympathetic autonomics!!!!! all the fibrs that are sympathetic have to **travel thru the blood vessels and carotids instead.** 
		- note sympathetic = thoracolumbar
		- parasympathetic = cranial sacral 


all parts of the NS connect at the cortex
diencephalon - by old anatomists, used to be part of the brainstem. 
- when u make the neural tubes, antrior end of that makes anterior neuropore, which makes the part of the diencephalon, making some of the vessels which make up the brainstem go around it 

overview of cerebral hemispheres 
- axial cut, circled area = the cerebral central core, which has the insula, claustrum, the internal capsule, and the thalamus shoved in that internal capsule. 
	- only thing not going thru the thalamus be4 reorg = the olfactory , and thalamus proects into the brain via internal capsule 
- whte matter
	- association cortex - within the hemisphere
	- commissural = one to the other (corpus callosum)
	- projection  = projects outside the cortex the corona radiata from the internal capsule. internal capsule itself is one, which will **connect cortex with other areas of the CNS like with cerebrum , spine, brainstem, nuclei.**

cerebral cortex: gray matter 
- has a constant thicness of 1.5 - 4.5 mm 
- folding = sA up = more cells (: )
- the only cells which will divide in the central nervous system 
	- dentate gyrus part of the hippocampal formation, short term memory. 
	- factory cells = in factory system 
- types of cerebral cortex - remember the names, 
	- neocortex/isocortex = 6 laminae or layers of it = 95% of brain; uppermost layer, dendrites + stuff
		- layers;
		- molecular layer : dendrites + horizontal layer of cajal 
		- granular layer: granular cells **receive input mainly from adjacent cortical areas**
		- external pyramidal layer - pyramidal cells which will **project mainly to contralateral hemisphere**
		- internal granular layer - gets input from thalamus!
		- internal pyramidal layer - projects DOWN to make the corticospinal tract ... like these are projection fibers 
		- layer 6 - projects back to the thalamus - polymorphic layer. / multiform layer = **feedback loop with the thalamus**
		- types of cells in the cerebral cortx
		1. pyramidal cells = BETZ cells or giant pyramidal cells = **part of corticalspinal tract, in layer 5/internal pyramidal alyer, bigger**
		2. stellate / granule cells - get information 
		3. fusiform or spindle - chabel of cells arranged horizontally -
		4. **horizontal cells of cajal will regulate some of the plasticity**
		5. cells of martinoti - important to **modulate cortical connections**
	- paleocortex - old cortex, 3-4 laminae, **mainly olfactory areas**
	- archicortex - oldest - 3 laminae, hippocampal formation. 
	- nerve fibers in the cerebral cortex: 
		- radial fibers - up and down running  
		- tangent fibers - run sideways 
			- inputs:
			- layer 4 <- thalamus 
functional areas:

cerebral white matter:

hippocampus :

thalamus : - part of the diencephalon - **in between cerebral hemispheres**
