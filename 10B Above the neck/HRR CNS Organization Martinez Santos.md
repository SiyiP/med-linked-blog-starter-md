orientation 
evertyhing above brainstem: **close to face. and ventral = close to belly/down. caudal inferior, dorsal up top**
rostral in **brainstem = top**, dorsal near our back, caudal is down aka towards the tail, ventral is towards the face. 
- it's like we rotated the axis on the brain downards!!!
==![[brain v brainstem neuroanatomical orientation]]==

**everything posterior is sensory.**
everything anterior = motor. 
	sulcus luminance - generate autonomic nervous system, the spinal cord in between anterior horn and posterior horn
	==- at that cranial + sacral level, u just have parasympathetic autonomics!!!!! all the fibers that are sympathetic have to **travel thru the blood vessels and carotids instead.**== 
		==- note sympathetic = thoracolumbar==
		==- parasympathetic = cranial sacral== 


all parts of the NS connect at the cortex
diencephalon - by old anatomists, used to be part of the brainstem. 
- When u make the neural tubes, anterior end of that makes anterior neuropore, which makes the part of the diencephalon, making some of the vessels which make up the brainstem go around it 

overview of cerebral hemispheres 
- axial cut, circled area = the cerebral central core, which has the insula, claustrum, the internal capsule, and the thalamus shoved in that internal capsule. 
	- only thing not going thru the thalamus be4 reorg = the olfactory, and thalamus projects into the brain via internal capsule 
- white matter
	- ==association cortex - within the hemisphere==
	- commissural = one to the other (corpus callosum)
	- ==projection = projects outside the cortex the corona radiata from the internal capsule. internal capsule itself is one, which will **connect cortex with other areas of the CNS like with cerebrum , spine, brainstem, nuclei.**==

cerebral cortex: gray matter 
- has a constant thicness of 1.5 - 4.5 mm 
- folding = sA up = more cells (: )
- the only cells which will divide in the central nervous system 
	- ==dentate gyrus part of the hippocampal formation, short term memory.== 
	- factory cells = in factory system 
- types of cerebral cortex - remember the names, 
	- ==neocortex/isocortex, largest part of the cerebral cortex = 6 laminae or layers of it = 95% of brain; uppermost layer, dendrites + stuff==
		- layers;
		1.  ==molecular layer : dendrites + horizontal layer of cajal.== 
		2. ==granular layer: granular cells **receive input mainly from adjacent cortical areas** to send out to other areas.==
			1. sends output to other cortical areas 
		3.  ==external pyramidal layer - pyramidal cells which will **project mainly to contralateral hemisphere**==
			1. send output to opposide hemiphere. 
		4. ==internal granular layer - gets i**nput from thalamus!**==
		5.  ==internal pyramidal layer - projects DOWN to make the **corticospinal tract** ... like these are projection fibers== 
			1. send output to subcortical structures 
		6. ==layer 6 - projects back to the thalamus - polymorphic layer. / multiform layer = **feedback loop with the thalamus**, to send an output to it==
			1. send output to thalamus 
		- types of ==cells in the cerebral cortex==
		1. ==pyramidal cells = BETZ cells or giant pyramidal cells = **part of corticalspinal tract, in layer 5/internal pyramidal layer, bigger**==
		2. ==stellate / granule cells - get information== 
		3. ==fusiform or spindle - channel of cells arranged horizontally -==
		4. ==**horizontal cells of cajal will regulate some of the plasticity**==
		5. ==cells of martinoti - important to **modulate cortical connections**==
	- ==paleocortex - old cortex, 3-4 laminae, **mainly olfactory areas**==
	- ==archicortex - oldest - 3 laminae, hippocampal formation.== 
	- nerve fibers in the cerebral cortex: 
		- ==radial fibers - up and down running==  
		- ==tangent fibers - run sideways== 
			- ==inputs: mainly in areas 4 + 5... seen with naked eye at area of the visual cortex.==
			- ==layer 4 <- thalamus== 
			- other cortical areas and brainstem modulate many ayers
			- ==outputs:== 
			- ==layer 2 granular layer -> other cortical areas==
			- ==layer 3 external pyramidal layer  -> opposite hemisphere==
			- ==5 internal pyramidal layer -> subcortical structures==
			- ==6  polymorphic layer -> thalamus== 
		- ==stria of gennari - outer layer of balager - in layer 4, the very prominent projection from the thalamus== 

functional areas:
- cells arranged in columns - all with specific function like skin slow/rapid adapting, joint affrents, muscle spindle afferents, deep tissue receptors. 
- 52 cortical areas  have variations in thickness, cell density and types and sizes of cells
major areas to remember:
- motor cortex = precentral gyrus  
- ==association cortices - are the chunks of brain on one side surrounding the post/precentral gyri - for complex processing bt the arrival of sensory input and the generation of behavior== 
	- ==wider areas that connect and can't be defined simply with one function== 
	- prefrontal, premotor, parietal, occipital and temporal association cortices 
	- ==PATHO: **pick's disease - with frontotemporal degen or dementia, resulting in complex personality changes + working memory deficits** - predom the frontal and temporal cortices== 
	- ==association fibers = **white matter within... the areas**==
		- ==short fibers = U fibers - **arcuate fibers, connecting adjacent gyri**==
		- ==long fibers = **connect widely separated gyri and org'd in bundles**==
			- ==cingulum== 
			- ==mainly **superior longitudinal fasciculus = connect frontal lobe with parietal lobe** among other parts of the ipsilateral hemisphere. (I, II, III).== 
			- also the ==inferior longitudinal fasciculus - connect **anterior temporal -> posterior occipital lobe... cuneus, lingual gyrus, convexity of occipital pole. goes along inf surfac of brain, deep to the fusiform gyrus.**==
			- frontooccipital fasciculus passes backward from the [frontal lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe "Frontal lobe"), along the lateral border of the [caudate nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudate_nucleus "Caudate nucleus"), and on the medial aspect of the [corona radiata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_radiata "Corona radiata"); its fibers radiate in a fan-like manner and pass into the [occipital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe "Occipital lobe") and [temporal lobes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe "Temporal lobe") lateral to the posterior and inferior cornua.
			- uncinate fasciculus 
	- ==commissural fibers - anterior + posterior comissures, and corpus callosum  -== 
		- corpus - 4 parts
			- rostrum
			- genu 
			- trunk
			- splenium 
		- anterior and posterior commissure 
	- ==proections: centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule== 
		- ==internal capsule will connect cortex vertically with subcortical areas (basal gangia, diencephalon, brainstem, SC)==
			- anterior limb
			- genu 
			- posterior limb 
		- ==corona radiata - and internal capsule are sorta connected this fans out near the outer bits== 
- somatosensory cortex - postcentral 
- auditory cortex = the small bit jutting out underneath the lateral fissure, on the temporal lobe! 
- visual cortex - the little tip at the back of the brain/caudal side of brain! goes in the inbetween a bit 

hippocampus : limbic system 
- most primitive, made up of **3-layered archicortex!**
- ==short term memory consolidation into long term traces==
- ==formation==
	- ==hippocampus==
	- ==dentate gyrus== 
	- ==subiculum== 

the diencephalon 
thalamus : - part of the diencephalon - **in between cerebral hemispheres**- 
all cortical inputs go thru except for olfacotry 
==relay nuclei in the middle of diencephalon== 
- ==**medial lemniscus/spinothalamic tract -> Ventral Posterior-> Somatosensory Cortex**==  
- ==**substantia nigra pars reticulata, internal globus pallidus, deep cerebellar nuclei -> VA ventral anterior and VL ventral lateral nuc of the thalamus-> Premotor and Motor Cortex**  ; function of relaying basal ganglia and cerebellar inputs to the cortex.== 
- ==**mammillary body/hippocampal formation -> Anterior thalamic nuclei -> Cingulate Gyrus**  ; function of limbic pathway== 
- ==**amygdala, olfactory cortex, limbic basal ganglia -> Mediodorsal -> Frontal Association Cortex**  ; limbic pathways , major relay to frontal== 
- ==**tectum/inf+sup colliculi (extrageniculate visual pathway/other sensory things)-> LP lateral posterior nucleus and Pulvinar -> parieto-occipito-temporal association Cortex** ; may help with pulvinar, may help maintain alertness, visual stimuli and conscious state==  
- ==**retinas -> LGN lateral geniculate nucleus -> Visual Cortex**==  
- ==**MGN medial geniculate nucleus -> Auditory Cortex**==

the ==reticular nucleus - lateral thalamus - **only nuc that doesn't project to cortex, but has interneurons, which takes input from other thalamic nuc and outputs back as oscillating circuit which will feedback.**==
