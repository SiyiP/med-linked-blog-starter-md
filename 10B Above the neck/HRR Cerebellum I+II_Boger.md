animated pathways in the lecture
there's many different layers in the cerebellum, but the labs of the nuclei are not covered in the labs
point = every lesion to cerebellum = the deficit is on the ipsilateral side, since they have to cross over for the change. 
only exception to this: lesion in the **medial motor system**
- this is a bilateral disorder, truncal ataxia but the side lesioned has a more pronounced effect.


- tentorum cerebelli over it 
- cerebellum not in genesis of movements
- gets sensory inputs from multiple ascending sources like the vestibular areas and proprioception 
- and input related to motor commands, descending things, from the premotor areas 
- inputs also from various structures like areas of cerebral cortex - like the **superior and inferior colliculus, auditory + visual input too**

thalami - 2 areas on top of it 
on the dorsal side, below the thalami - superior colliculi and inferior colliculi hidden by the cerebellum. 
- gyri of cerebellum = folia 
- 2 hemispheres laterally 
- intermediate zone/paravermal zone
- vermis on midline 
- 2 deep fissures = primary = superior side to divide into main lobes
	- ==find dr boger to id the primary fissure properly!== 
- and posterolateral , anterior region of cerebellum = for flocculonodular 
	- flocculonodular - 2 flocculi under that cerebral peduncle component 
	- the F-n lobe lol 
	- flocculus = ont he side, the bulge, 
	- nodule of this = is near the midline on the level where the tonsils come out and jut out 
- anterior and posterior lobes 
- middle cerebellar peduncle - extends medial to lateral into cerebellum. and a posteriolateral fissure lateral to this. 

the cerebellar peduncles will attach to the brain stem! 
- upper = superior colliculi 
- and inferior = inferior colliculi 
- number 4 = the CN 4 will come thru the dorsal surface of the brainstem, the TROCHLEAR N  
the peduncle = a fiber bundle that will connect cerebellum with the nervous system = 
- **middle cerebellar peduncle bring fibers into the cerebellum**
	- biggest part, and the CN 5 trigeminal n will come thru in the ventral view ... 
	- getting information from **motor cortex + premotor areas**
	- only has afferent but they come from the **contralateral pontine nuclei...**
- below = inferior cerebellar peduncle - bringing in afferent fibers coming in from the **spinal cord + vestibular area**
	- predominantly afferent, **ipsilateral info from the SC and lower brainstem areas!!!**
- superior cerebellar peduncle - **predominantly efferent, angling upwards, into the nuclei of thalamus and then the cortices**
	- they **cross to the *contralateral* brain stem nuclei, synapse in RED NUCLEUS!** and the thalamus!

id these peduncles both on the cerebellum and the brainstem. these are all more light beige fibers.
- tonsils - bottom of cerebellum, next to the cisterna magnae, where spinal cord is 
- if somethings growing on top of cerebellum, will push those tonsils into the cisterna magna, causing problems
	- **tonsillar herniation**


cerebellum organization 
- flattened cerebellum, with the information that is divided into 3 parts 
![[cerebellum org.png]]
- cerebrocerebellum - predom lateral hemisphere
	- **gets input from cortical areas via pontine nuclei**
	- regulate the fine motor control and execution 
	- the cerebrocerebellar pathway = planning + initiation of volitional movement 
	1. motor cortex 
	2. decending signal thru the internal capsule, thru the cerebral peduncle,
	3. synapse in the pontine nuclei 
	4. sending signal thru processes that **cross to contralateral side thru middle cerebellar peduncle**
	5. then synapse in dentate nucleus/and some fibers into the lateral hemisphere 
		1. if you lesion the R dentate nuc or hemisphere, deficits are **ipsilateral!!! bc the dentate nuc will then send back to the thalamus on the OTHER SIDE... so uncorrected movements get sent to this on the same side.**
		2. ![[lesion of the dentate nucleus.png|278x216]]
	6. **if error corrections necssary** , the dentate nucleus would send signal out following the superior cerebellar peduncle
	7. cross to the **contralateral thalamus**
	8. contralateral thalamus sends to the premotor + motor areas 
	9. and then after the **correction...** motor cortex will send the corrected info down thru the **internal capsule, midbrain, pons, medulla**
	10. 90% of fibers would cross at medulla into the contralateral side for motor function. 
-  cerebrocerebellar pathway part II. - motor learning . baby progressing and learning how to crawl and roll , falling sends coding info to brain for processes as we learn that behavior as we learn to walk 
	1. motor cortex sends signals into that **red nucleus, ipsilaterally, facilitation of flexors AND motor learning**
	2. red nucleus sends signals into the inferior olivary nucleus on its side, 
	3. inf olivary nuclueus sends info to the **CONTRALATERAL dentate nucleus/lateral hemisphere via the INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE.**
	4. dentate sends from the info to the **red nucleus back there contralaterally via the Superior cerebellar peduncle!!*
	5. we make a triangle between these! triad of red nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus and dentate nucleus is a motor learning curve triad for that behavior. 
	6. once we get smooth behavior, we **eventually have the Dentate nucleus/lateral hemiphere send info CONTRALATERALLy to the thalamus**
	7. and the thalamus sends to premotor + motor cortex on that same side. 
	8. motor cortex sends motor instructions to the other side as usually 

- spinocerebellum pathways - **aiding in ongoing movements bc we get that proprioceptive information here.**
	- vermal + paravermal regions - more medial 
	- gets input **direct from spinal cord**
	- **more lateral portion = regulation of movement of distal muscle = arm and distal** 
	- sensory in legs -> **clarkes nucleus -> inferior cerebellar peduncle -> spinocerebellum region**
	- more medial portion like the vermi - associated wit **proximal muscles like postural controol + EYE MOVEMENTS**
	- we have a map here, mapping body parts unlike the somatosensory cortex, we have a smaller map and toes linked to whatever still very organized. 
	1. proprioceptive info from leg go into dorsal root ganglion 
	2. dorsal root ganglion go into the **thoracic level of cord ascending into clarkes nucleus**
	3. clarke's nucleus takes that information and **sends it up the spinal cord thru the LATERAL column**
	4. and then at the medulla - the fibers **enter into cerebellum via INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE**
	5. info will synapse in interposed/fastigial nucleus 
		1. if there's a lesion, we will see deficits on the **ipsilateral side of where the sensory info is**
		2. ![[fastigial nuc lesion.png]]
	6. if error coding is necessary, corrective info is going **out the superior cerebellar peduncle onto the CONTRALATERAL side into the thalamus**
	7. from the thlamus, going to the motor and premotor cortex 
	8. then the error corrected version will be sent back into the **contralateral side where the signal was originally from** to correct into the dorsal root ganglion 
- from the upper extremities = spinocerebellar pathway still 
	1. entrance of the senses to dorsal root then to spinal cord at cervical lvl ;  
	2. gets to level of medulla. - **synapse at the external cuneat information = gets unconscious proprioception info**
		1. recall - the cuneate nucleus not the external one gets touch, pressure, vibration from the upper extremities. 
	3. extneral cuneate nucleus sends info **thru ipsilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle into the fastigial / interposed nucleus.**
	4. eror correction from interposed nuleus into the **contralateral thalamus,**
	5. same old - into the premotor + motor cortex, which would then send to the contralateral movements to the other side. 

- vestibulocerebellum - made up o the flocculonodular lobe - **taking angular and linear acceleration in to maintain that postural balance, tone etc eye movements all that**
	- get input from **vestibular nuclei**
	- regulates vestibuloocular reflexes + postural control 
	- head neck, shoulder, eye movements 
	1. activation of vestibular organ inside the ear like semicircular canals with spinning 
	2. go thru the **CN VIII, which is vestibuloocular nerve**
	3. goes into the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei 
	4. moves info from the ipsilateral side using **inferior cerebellar peduncle into the FN or flocculonodular lobe**
	5. FN lobe will error correct by **sending it back out on the ipsilateral side using inferior cerebellar peduncle into vestibular nuclei**
	6. vestibular nuceili would send **descending signals down same side to regulate body positions and ascending signals into the eye movements**
deep cerebellar nuclei - know these nuclei would send info out of cerebellum for motor correction - **these are all major output centers for the cerebellum!!!!** 
- dentate nuclei - lateral hemisphere - worm like 
- emboliform nuc - interposed nuclei = paravermal region 
- globose nuclei interposed nuclei = paravermal region 
- fastigial nuclei - vermal region ! most medial 
note - the vestibulacerebelar pathway doesn't really have or involve a deep cerebellar nuc 
1. granular layer - innermost layer - **mossy fibers from so many diff places send input from these from for instance the pons, spinal cord, etc. EXCEPT the inferior olivary nucleus** synapsse with granule cells 
2. purkinje layer - middle, each dendritic tree receives input from single climbing fibers from the controlateral **inferior olivary nucleus, part of that motor learning processes**
	1. the climbing fibrs would climb that purkinje fiber into the molecular layer 
3. molecular layer - outermost - has purkinje **dendritic tree,s and also 2 inhibitory neurons the stellate and basket cells**
	1. climbing fibers will go up purkinje processes +
	2. the projections **of granule cells that** **bifurcate, making the parallel processes which will spread the signals across that cerebellar cortex for appropriate processing**
- those mossy + climbing fibers also will synapse in the **deep cerebellar nuclei, so they have bilateral input, sending it down to the deep cerebellar nuclei and up towards the cerebellar layers.**

current theory 
if an error in coding is detected 
1. mossy fibers - some will synapse into deep cerebellar nuc others will send them up synapsing with granule cells which give the parallel fibers up top 
2. simultaneously, with motor learning from the inferior olive, inferior olive will give off to the deep cerebellar nuclei as well as clibing those purkinje cells
3. with **both sets of fibers activated together spontaneously in high voltage fashio, we get LONG TERM DEPRESSION LTD**
4. LTD -> basically if initiated at the dendritic trees of purkinje cells, the purkinjje cell as a whole is **inhibited**
5. and the deep cerebellar nucleus that it was synapsed onto would be **activated, so a motor command/correction signal is send outta the cerebellum to its target**
	1. basically you disinhibit the deep cerebellar nuclei if error correction is necessary, allowing it to shoot out the corrective information 
	2. if the correction isn't necessary - **there is no heightened firing int he molecular layer and purkinje cells would release GABA into the cerebellar nucleus bc it's not needed!**

any disturbances of posture, equilibrium + gait 
1. impaired rhythmic movement s- impairment of motor/perpetual tasks that require accurate timing like **finger tapping** (can't do it fast, have to focus on this)
2. eye movement abnormalities - disruption of saccadic eye movements - **more focused positioning of eyes rather than sharp movements bt 2 focal points bc the superior colliculus and vestibular sends info into it to get eye information**
3. ataxia - 
	1. postural/truncal - lesion to the caudal vermis bc of medial motor aspects of systems, unsteadiness of head + trunk when seated, standing and walking poorly corrected by visual stabilization - **drunken sailor gait** - wider stance for stability 
	2. appendicular ataxia - lesions of intermediate + lateral portions of cerebellar hemisphere - impact **lateral motor systems, ataxia on movement of extremities**-
		1. touch their nose to finger and back to urs.... if we don't do fast and smooth movements, we have this. 
		2. lower extremity - test heel to shin test. 
romberg - testing with 2 feet together, not goonna even be able to happen = still considered negative  
	3. more of a test of proprioception behavior, DCML. 
	4. dmg to the dorsal column - offline is the proprioception AND visual input -> falls over.

cases
- lesion of vermis most common in kids = **medulloblastoma in roof of 4th ventricle**
	- intracranial pressure signs = headache, vomit, drowsiness, papilledemia
	- trunca atasia = unable to stand upright without support... involves vermis + FN lobe - vestibulospinals impacted  
	- nystagmus eye flutter left and right  - superior cerebellar peduncle impacted 
- case 2 = chronic alc use 
	- lesion in the anterior lobe!! shrinkage of this lobe in the cerebellum 
	- **lower limbs = are most impacted**
	- staggering drunken gait even when the patient is sober, inability to stand with feet together + inability to toe a line 
- case 3 - lesion to neocerebellar cortex, dentate nuc, and superior cerebllar peduncal 
	- incoordination of voluntary movements of upper limbs... **we swing our arms when we walk and wont' have this anymore**
	- intention tremor (not go away even with movements)
	- adiadochokinesis, asynergy, hypotonia 
	- speech impaired with phonics + articulation - lack of coordination with breathing. 
- not talked abt a lot = link? cognitive-affective syndrome - not understood. 
	- can be resulted from **posterior cerebellar lobe dmg**
	- cognitive disfunction - in planning, reasoning, working memory, visuospatial reasoning
	- mutism too - language deficit , can happen after surgery by just moving cerebellum out the way during chiari surgery ): 
	- affective disorder - disinhibited behavior etc
