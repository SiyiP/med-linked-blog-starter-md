animated pathways in the lecture
there's many different layers in the cerebellum, but the labs of the nuclei are not covered in the labs

- tentorum cerebelli over it 
- cerebellum not in genesis of movements
- gets sensory inputs from multiple ascending sources like the vestibular areas and proprioception 
- and input related to motor commands, descending things, from the premotor areas 
- inputs also from various structures like areas of cerebral cortex - like the **superior and inferior colliculus, auditory + visual input too**

thalami - 2 areas on top of it 
on the dorsal side, below the thalami - superior colliculi and inferior colliculi hidden by the cerebellum. 
- gyri of cerebellum = folia 
- 2 hemispheres laterally 
- intermediate zone/paravermal zone
- vermis on midline 
- 2 deep fissures = primary = superior side to divide into main lobes
	- ==find dr boger to id the primary fissure properly!== 
- and posterolateral , anterior region of cerebellum = for flocculonodular 
	- flocculonodular - 2 flocculi under that cerebral peduncle component 
	- the F-n lobe lol 
- anterior and posterior lobes 
- middle cerebellar peduncle - extends medial to lateral into cerebellum. and a posteriolateral fissure lateral to this. 

the cerebellar peduncles will attach to the brain stem! 
- upper = superior colliculi 
- and inferior = inferior colliculi 
- number 4 = the CN 4 will come thru the dorsal surface of the brainstem, the TROCHLEAR N  
the peduncle = a fiber bundle that will connect cerebellum with the nervous system = 
- **middle cerebellar peduncle bring fibers into the cerebellum**
	- biggest part, and the CN 5 trigeminal n will come thru in the ventral view ... 
	- getting information from **motor cortex + premotor areas**
	- only has afferent but they come from the **contralateral pontine nuclei...**
- below = inferior cerebellar peduncle - bringing in afferent fibers coming in from the **spinal cord + vestibular area**
	- predominantly afferent, **ipsilateral info from the SC and lower brainstem areas!!!**
- superior cerebellar peduncle - **predominantly efferent, angling upwards, into the nuclei of thalamus and then the cortices**
	- they **cross to the *contralateral* brain stem nuclei, synapse in RED NUCLEUS!** and the thalamus!

id these peduncles both on the cerebellum and the brainstem. these are all more light beige fibers.
- tonsils - bottom of cerebellum, next to the cisterna magnae, where spinal cord is 
- if somethings growing on top of cerebellum, will push those tonsils into the cisterna magna, causing problems
	- **tonsillar herniation**


cerebellum organization 
- flattened cerebellum, with the information that is divided into 3 parts 
![[cerebellum org.png]]
- cerebrocerebellum - predom lateral hemisphere
	- **gets input from cortical areas via pontine nuclei**
	- regulate the fine motor control and execution 
	- the cerebrocerebellar pathway = planning + initiation of volitional movement 
	1. motor cortex 
	2. decending signal thru the internal capsule, thru the cerebral peduncle,
	3. synapse in the pontine nuclei 
	4. sending signal thru processes that **cross to contralateral side thru middle cerebellar peduncle**
	5. then synapse in dentate nucleus/and some fibers into the lateral hemisphere 
		1. if you lesion the R dentate nuc or hemisphere, deficits are **ipsilateral!!! bc the dentate nuc will then send back to the thalamus on the OTHER SIDE... so uncorrected movements get sent to this on the same side.**
		2. ![[lesion of the dentate nucleus.png|278x216]]
	6. **if error corrections necssary** , the dentate nucleus would send signal out following the superior cerebellar peduncle
	7. cross to the **contralateral thalamus**
	8. contralateral thalamus sends to the premotor + motor areas 
	9. and then after the **correction...** motor cortex will send the corrected info down thru the **internal capsule, midbrain, pons, medulla**
	10. 90% of fibers would cross at medulla into the contralateral side for motor function. 
-  cerebrocerebellar pathway part II. - motor learning . baby progressing and learning how to crawl and roll , falling sends coding info to brain for processes as we learn that behavior as we learn to walk 
	1. motor cortex sends signals into that **red nucleus, ipsilaterally, facilitation of flexors AND motor learning**
	2. red nucleus sends signals into the inferior olivary nucleus on its side, 
	3. inf olivary nuclueus sends info to the **CONTRALATERAL dentate nucleus/lateral hemisphere via the INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE.**
	4. dentate sends from the info to the **red nucleus back there contralaterally via the Superior cerebellar peduncle!!*
	5. we make a triangle between these! triad of red nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus and dentate nucleus is a motor learning curve triad for that behavior. 
	6. once we get smooth behavior, we **eventually have the Dentate nucleus/lateral hemiphere send info CONTRALATERALLy to the thalamus**
	7. and the thalamus sends to premotor + motor cortex on that same side. 
	8. motor cortex sends motor instructions to the other side as usually 


- spinocerebellum pathways - **aiding in ongoing movements bc we get that proprioceptive information here.**
	- vermal + paravermal regions - more medial 
	- gets input **direct from spinal cord**
	- **more lateral portion = regulation of movement of distal muscle = arm and distal** 
	- sensory in legs -> **clarkes nucleus -> inferior cerebellar peduncle -> spinocerebellum region**
	- more medial portion like the vermi - associated wit **proximal muscles like postural controol + EYE MOVEMENTS**
	- we have a map here, mapping body parts unlike the somatosensory cortex, we have a smaller map and toes linked to whatever still very organized. 
	1. proprioceptive info from leg go into dorsal root ganglion 
	2. dorsal root ganglion go into the **thoracic level of cord ascending into clarkes nucleus**
	3. clarke's nucleus takes that information and **sends it up the spinal cord thru the LATERAL column**
	4. and then at the medulla - the fibers **enter into cerebellum via INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE**
	5. info will synapse in interposed/fastigial nucleus 
		1. if there's a lesion, we will see deficits on the **ipsilateral side of where the sensory info is**
		2. ![[fastigial nuc lesion.png]]
	6. if error coding is necessary, corrective info is going **out the superior cerebellar peduncle onto the CONTRALATERAL side into the thalamus**
	7. from the thlamus, going to the motor and premotor cortex 
	8. then the error corrected version will be sent back into the **contralateral side where the signal was originally from** to correct into the dorsal root ganglion 
- from the upper extremities = spinocerebellar pathway still 
	1. entrance of the senses to dorsal root then to spinal cord at cervical lvl ;  
	2. gets to level of medulla. - **synapse at the external cuneat information = gets unconscious proprioception info**
		1. recall - the cuneate nucleus not the external one gets touch, pressure, vibration from the upper extremities. 
	3. extneral cuneate nucleus sends info **thru ipsilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle into the fastigial / interposed nucleus.**
	4. eror correction from interposed nuleus into the **contralateral thalamus,**
	5. same old - into the premotor + motor cortex, which would then send to the contralateral movements to the other side. 

- vestibulocerebellum - made up o the flocculonodular lobe - **taking angular and linear acceleration in to maintain that postural balance, tone etc eye movements all that**
	- get input from **vestibular nuclei**
	- regulates vestibuloocular reflexes + postural control 
	- head neck, shoulder, eye movements 
	1. activation of vestibular organ inside the ear like semicircular canals with spinning 
	2. go thru the **CN VIII, which is vestibuloocular nerve**
	3. goes into the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei 
	4. moves info from the ipsilateral side using **inferior cerebellar peduncle into the FN or flocculonodular lobe**
	5. FN lobe will error correct by **sending it back out on the ipsilateral side using inferior cerebellar peduncle into vestibular nuclei**
	6. vestibular nuceili would send **descending signals down same side to regulate body positions and ascending signals into the eye movements**
deep cerebellar nuclei - know these nuclei would send info out of cerebellum for motor correction - **these are all major output centers for the cerebellum!!!!** 
- dentate nuclei - lateral hemisphere - worm like 
- emboliform nuc - interposed nuclei = paravermal region 
- globose nuclei interposed nuclei = paravermal region 
- fastigial nuclei - vermal region ! most medial
