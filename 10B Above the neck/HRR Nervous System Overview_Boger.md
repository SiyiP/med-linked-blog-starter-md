what to expect - use this as a reference/outline - provides terminology + relationships. 

purpose of nervous system 
- proprioception + motor function. - fast, myelin 
- slower - think autonomics + pain/temp translation. 
- NT produced are all specific 

always recall - NS divisions
- CNS (brain + spinal cord)
- peripheral NS (cranial + spinal nn)
	- sensory components (dorsal root ganglia for ex) will get info from internal + external environment and transmit it ot the CNS , via dorsal roots
	- CNS processes this, sends signals back via motor compoentnes of the PNS
		- somatic motor = sekeltal muscles
		- visceral motor - autonomics 

gray matter - always cell bodies of neurons 
- in brain this is more external as cortex, layered up, but in spinal cord it's flipped. 
- and there are internal clumps of gray matter in the brain - called nuclei. subcortical regions. thalamus, is considered a nuclei, basal ganglia, etc. 
- white matter = they are **columns of spinal cord** and will be **ascending, fibers into the CNS** vs the descending ones out of the CNS
- lateral column of spinal cord- group of axons on lateral side - **mixed fibers, ascending + descending**
- makes sense that dorsla columns - **all ascending**
- anterior columns - all descending. 

these bundles of fibers with functions = called TRACT = fibers of common function, more exclusive term.
but columns is more inclusive terms 

major regions of brain ![[major regions of the brain.png|484x421]]
cerebrum 
- mainly 2 symmetrical L/R hemispheres divided by longitudinal fissure/sulcus 
- temporal , parietal, frontal, occcipital lobe. 
- central sulcus will divide the frontal + parietal lobe. (postcentral gyrus somatosensation, and precentral is somatomotor)
- lateral fissue/sylvian fissure will divide frontal + parietal from the temporal + occipital? 
- connected by the corpus callosum fiber bundle on midline 
- folded into sulci grooves/gyri (ridges)

cerebrum has white matter - fiber bundles seen 
- commissural fibers =runs bt hemispheres, 
- association 
- projection 
gray matter - **neuroglia** + bodies. 
- subcortical gray matter here too - aka Nuclei - includes but not limited to: 
	Substantia nigra  
	Caudate/putamen  
	Globus pallidus  
	Subthalamic nucleus  
	Thalamus  
	Hypothalamus  
	Amygdala  
	Nucleus accumbens  
	Hippocampus  
	Deep cerebellar nuclei  
	Cranial nerve nuclei

brainstem - associated with 11/12 cranial nn; understand cranial nn with brain stem perspective
- only one is #1 not associatio, which is olfaction. 
- midbrain/mescencephalon, pons, medulla 
if it is a motor CN, **sit near midline, m for m**
sensory = to the side, S for S

cerebellum - coordination, precision, accurate timing of movement, but **not in the genesis**
receives sensory inputs from multiple ascending sources, and then input related to motor (descending)
- gets input from various other brain structures too. 
- signiicant role in motor learning, in children learning remember. 

you'll id spinal cord review crosssections to find more aobut the function 

CNs protection + support
- bone layer - skull + verte
- meningeal layers of dura mater, arachnoid, pia mater,
- CSF 

meninges
- dura - sepaarate to make dural sinuses
- arachnoid -  thinner, translucent, trabeculated... subarachnoid = CSF cushion
- pia mater - adhre to tissue, thin membrane, **limit exchange from ECF + CSF, surroudnign the arteries as they penetrate brain.**
CSF 
choroid plexus = 'grapes of brain', near the ventricles, if it's been purfused well, will be big and white. or little red if it's not perfused well
- associated in all the ventricles
- most of the CSF is made by the choroid plexus 
- choroid plexus and the lining of ventricles. - **made up of ependymal cells!!! large molecules to not allow random stufff into the nervous system, remember?**
CSF = always actively making it, tends to travel down via ventricles to the cerebral aquaduct, and 2 foramen (median aperture etc, that the CSF will then **exit to get into the subarachnoid space**
- the pressurized subarachnoid system pushes the CSF throughout the brain and some are recycled too. 
- if we have an obstruction of CSF blockage, luckily we have the choroid plexus of ventricles to make some and then it circulates. only issue now is that it can build up in locations, we need a tap to drain it 
![[CSF flow inside brain.png]]

blood supply to brain 
- **internal carotids =-> anterior region of brain**
- vertebral aa -> posterior region of brain 
- and we have **shunting bt = circle of willis**
- no protection against fast-acting clot 

BBB
- made by **capillary endothelial cells, adjacent astrocytes foot proceses induce our capillary endothelium to make tight junctions!!!!!!**
- - **endothelium coatd with p-glycoprotein = negative charges will repel many small molecules too**
- these astrocytes foot makes tight junctions, protecting this CSF from chem flux and other things
- downfall - drugs aren't useful to treat CNS disorders if they don't cross the BBB - might have to do intercranial injections. 
- many drugs of abuse = lipid soluble

know these
• Ipsilateral vs contralateral - big point!  
	ipsilateral same side, contralateral crosses over. 
• Medial vs lateral  
• Afferent vs efferent  
• Proximal vs distal  
• Ascending vs descending

gangion - grp of neurons outside of cns 
nuc - group neurons in the cns

nerve - grp of nerve fibers outside cns
tract - grp of nerve fibers inside cns
