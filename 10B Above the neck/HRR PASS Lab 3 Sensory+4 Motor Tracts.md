passlab 3 
- Mechanosensory fibers are topographically organized in the dorsal column of the spinal cord with fibers (medial to lateral) from the sacral region being the most medial, then the legs, then the trunk, etc
- Pain and temp fibers are topographically organized in the lateral column of the spinal cord with fibers (lateral to medial) from the sacral region being the most lateral, then the legs, then the trunk, etc
- Some mechanoceptors leave the dorsal columns and synapse in the dorsal nucleus of Clarke. Second order axons project ipsilaterally by the dorsal spinocerebellar tract to the cerebellum.
	- Some proprioceptive fibers will exist the dorsal column

1. gracile nuc = mechanosensory from lower body 
2. cuneate nuc =  mechanosensory from upper body 
3. spinal trigeminal nuc = **pain and temp** from face 
4. medial lemniscus - crossing point of DCML 
5. ALS pathway = pain and temperature 

Within the **medial lemniscus**, mechanosensory information from the contralateral body is organized like a headless man standing upright…legs ventral and arms dorsal. Face mechanosensation does not exist at this level in the brainstem
- legs are most ventral 
- arms most dorsal 

Pain and temp fibers from the contralateral body are organized with legs lateral and face medial

1. DCML
2. ALS
3. principle trigeminal nucleus (synapse of the mechanosensory stuff)
4. trigeminal nerve??

at the MIDBRAIN...
ALS pathway is dorsolateral to the DCML

somatosensory inputs come to the ventral posterior nucleus in the midbrain 
in the ventral posterior nucleus, we have this organization:
- Ventral posterior nucleus: VPL - body; VPM - face
	- think: L for lateral, L for legs. 
- face most medial, most lateral is the legs 
then, from the VP nucleus, we project to the somatosensory processing 
- the **posterior limb of the internal capsule then connects the VP nucleus to somatosensory cortex....**
- The posterior limb of the internal capsule relays somatosensory information from the thalamus to the SS cortex. 
- The anterior limb of the internal capsule provides communication between cortical and subcortical nuclei.

and in the somatosensory cortex itself, the inputs are flipped!

passlab 4 motor voluntary movement 
precentral gyrus - motor cortex 
prefrontal cortex - inclusive of supplemental mtor area 
- similar to closer to the brain in the somatosensory stuff , the legs area hanging off midline cliff
- but later as we travel down are all lateral 
![[horizontal section of forebrain.png]]
- caudate nucleus = part of basal ganglia, the corpus striatum, helps with execution of movement 
- putamen - regulate movement in various stages suc as in prep + execution 
- globus pallidus - conscious and voluntary movement by inhbitiing thalamus, regulation like such? 

inside the internal capsule, the descending motor axons are:
- **genu (to the face)** - anterior part of corpus callosum connecting frontal lobes of brain 
- posterior limb (anterior half of this is for the neck + down, and posterior half of the limb are all sensory axons)

- Descending corticospinal axons travel through the middle 1/3 of the cerebral peduncle.  The lateral 1/3 and most medial 1/3 carries corticocerebellar axons.

The major input of information to the red nucleus is from the cerebellum as part of motor learning, but the motor cortex will send signals to the red nucleus as well to modulate the rubrospinal tract.
Red nucleus neurons project to the spinal cord forming the rubrospinal tract.-  this is the descending tract that is formed by axons of red nucleus neurons
