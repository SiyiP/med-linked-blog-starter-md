- Mechanosensory fibers are topographically organized in the dorsal column of the spinal cord with fibers (medial to lateral) from the sacral region being the most medial, then the legs, then the trunk, etc
- Pain and temp fibers are topographically organized in the lateral column of the spinal cord with fibers (lateral to medial) from the sacral region being the most lateral, then the legs, then the trunk, etc
- Some mechanoceptors leave the dorsal columns and synapse in the dorsal nucleus of Clarke. Second order axons project ipsilaterally by the dorsal spinocerebellar tract to the cerebellum.
	- Some proprioceptive fibers will exist the dorsal column

1. gracile nuc = mechanosensory from lower body 
2. cuneate nuc =  mechanosensory from upper body 
3. spinal trigeminal nuc = **pain and temp** from face 
4. medial lemniscus - crossing point of DCML 
5. ALS pathway = pain and temperature 

Within the **medial lemniscus**, mechanosensory information from the contralateral body is organized like a headless man standing uprightâ€¦legs ventral and arms dorsal. Face mechanosensation does not exist at this level in the brainstem
- legs are most ventral 
- arms most dorsal 

Pain and temp fibers from the contralateral body are organized with legs lateral and face medial

1. DCML
2. ALS
3. principle trigeminal nucleus (synapse of the mechanosensory stuff)
4. trigeminal nerve??

at the MIDBRAIN...
ALS pathway is dorsolateral to the DCML

somatosensory inputs come to the ventral posterior nucleus in the midbrain 
in the ventral posterior nucleus, we have this organization:
- Ventral posterior nucleus: VPL - body; VPM - face
	- think: L for lateral, L for legs. 
- face most medial, most lateral is the legs 
then, from the VP nucleus, we project to the somatosensory processing 
- the **posterior limb of the internal capsule then connects the VP nucleus to somatosensory cortex....**
- The posterior limb of the internal capsule relays somatosensory information from the thalamus to the SS cortex. 
- The anterior limb of the internal capsule provides communication between cortical and subcortical nuclei.

and in the somatosensory cortex itself, the inputs are flipped!
