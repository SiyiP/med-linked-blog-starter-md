**Tract Organization of the Cervical SC** 

The basal ganglia and the cerebellum provide important modulation for voluntary motor movements.  
	The cerebellum provides motor smoothing during intentional movements, 
	the basal ganglia provide overall inhibition or excitation of the motor systems based on the current demands of the system.

passlab 3 
- Mechanosensory fibers are topographically organized in the dorsal column of the spinal cord with fibers (medial to lateral) from the sacral region being the most medial, then the legs, then the trunk, etc
- Pain and temp fibers are topographically organized in the lateral column of the spinal cord with fibers (lateral to medial) from the sacral region being the most lateral, then the legs, then the trunk, etc
- Some mechanoceptors leave the dorsal columns and synapse in the **dorsal nucleus of Clarke**. Second order axons project ipsilaterally by the dorsal spinocerebellar tract to the cerebellum.
	- Some proprioceptive fibers will exist the dorsal column
	- the dorsal nuc of clarke - **relays mechanosensory info from lumbar region to the cerebellum**

![[closed medulla labeling nuclei.png]]
1. gracile nuc = mechanosensory from lower body 
2. cuneate nuc =  mechanosensory from upper body 
	1. 
3. spinal trigeminal nuc = **pain and temp** from face 
4. medial lemniscus - crossing point of DCML 
5. ALS pathway = pain and temperature 

Within the **medial lemniscus**, mechanosensory information from the contralateral body is organized like a headless man standing upright…legs ventral and arms dorsal. Face mechanosensation does not exist at this level in the brainstem
- legs are most ventral 
- arms most dorsal 

Pain and temp fibers from the contralateral body are organized with legs lateral and face medial

![[pons labeling nuceli.png]]
1. DCML
2. ALS
3. principle trigeminal nucleus (synapse of the mechanosensory stuff)
4. trigeminal nerve??

at the MIDBRAIN...
ALS pathway is dorsolateral to the DCML

somatosensory inputs come to the ventral posterior nucleus in the midbrain 
in the ventral posterior nucleus, we have this organization:
- Ventral posterior nucleus: VPL - body; VPM - face
	- think: L for lateral, L for legs. 
- face most medial, most lateral is the legs 
then, from the VP nucleus, we project to the somatosensory processing 
- the **posterior limb of the internal capsule then connects the VP nucleus to somatosensory cortex....**
- The posterior limb of the internal capsule relays somatosensory information from the thalamus to the SS cortex. 
- The anterior limb of the internal capsule provides communication between cortical and subcortical nuclei.

and in the somatosensory cortex itself, the inputs are flipped!

passlab 4 motor voluntary movement 
precentral gyrus - motor cortex 
prefrontal cortex - inclusive of supplemental mtor area 
- similar to closer to the brain in the somatosensory stuff , the legs area hanging off midline cliff
- but later as we travel down are all lateral 
![[horizontal section of forebrain.png]]
- caudate nucleus = part of basal ganglia, the corpus striatum, helps with execution of movement 
- putamen - regulate movement in various stages suc as in prep + execution 
- globus pallidus - conscious and voluntary movement by inhbitiing thalamus, regulation like such
	- seems to be underneath the putamen, nested bt putamen + internal capsule 

inside the internal capsule, the **descending motor axons are:**
- **genu (to the face)** - anterior part of corpus callosum connecting frontal lobes of brain 
- posterior limb (anterior half of this is for the neck + down, and posterior half of the limb are all sensory axons)
	- meidal to the posterior limb is the thalamus 
	- you can see cerebral peduncle at midbrain lvl 
	- middle cerebral peduncle - The middle cerebral peduncle is the major input to the cerebellum, carrying information from cortical areas for error correction.
	- Correction information is relayed vis the superior cerebellar peduncle to the contralateral thalamus then to the cortex.
	- The inferior cerebellar peduncle is defined as a structure that connects the cerebellum to the brainstem and is associated with the vestibulocerebellum. It plays a role in **coordinating balance and eye movements**.

- Descending corticospinal axons travel through the middle 1/3 of the cerebral peduncle.  The lateral 1/3 and most medial 1/3 carries corticocerebellar axons.

The major input of information to the red nucleus is from the cerebellum as part of motor learning, but the motor cortex will send signals to the red nucleus as well to modulate the rubrospinal tract.

Red nucleus neurons project to the spinal cord forming the rubrospinal tract.-  this is the descending tract that is formed by axons of red nucleus neurons
- this meaning that **major source of input to red nuc: motor cortex**

**Axons of red nucleus neurons** **descend** to form the **rubrospinal tract,** which **cross just ventral to their exit from the red nucleus.**
![[brain v brainstem neuroanatomical orientation]]

rostral midbrain 
![[rostral midbrain.png]]

the fiber bundle ventral + medial to periaqueductal gray = medial longitudinal fasciculus = MLF 
- Axons of this bundle ascend and descend between the three oculomotor nuclei.  Connections between the three oculomotor nuclei allow coordination of eye movements.  **Connections between vestibular nuclei and oculomotor nuclei allow eye movements in response to head movement.**

isthmus - midbrain pons junction 
![[isthmus - midbrain pons junction.png]]
axons synapse on pontine nuclear cells in base of pons - the axons that travel to contrallateral cerebellar hemisphee via middle cerebellar peduncle 
also axons of the corticospinal tract - we see them travel rostrocaudally thru the pons as the corticospinal tract
axons are axons synapsing on pontine nuclear cells in base of pons = axons traveling to the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere via the middle cerebellar peduncle

The trigeminal motor nucleus of CN V is found just medial to the principal sensory nucleus of CN V.
	Touch, pressure, and vibration from the face is relayed via the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. 
	Pain and temperature are relayed from the face via the spinal trigeminal nucleus located at the level of the medulla.
note - CN V sensory enters & motor exits the brainstem laterally through the middle cerebellar peduncle.

pons 
![[pons.png]]
pons + medulla? the junction there 
![[pons + medulla junction.png]]

vestibular system
- Lateral vestibular nuclei receive input from the utricle and saccule (respond to position of the head and linear acceleration) 
- the medial vestibular nuclei receive input from semicircular canals (angular acceleration).
The vestibular division of CNVIII carries the activity into the brainstem.


- Vestibular nuclei project to the cerebellum by way of the inferior cerebellar peduncle, especially densely to flocculonodular lobe, for error correction.
- basically the inferior cerebellar peduncle connects the vestibular nuc to cerebellum !
-
rostral medulla 
![[rostral medulla.png]]

pyramidal tract - more lateral, will have **descending corticospinal fibers**
pyramidal decussation - where the corticospinal fibers cross hence a horizontal orientation, more near the middle of the medulla spinal junction. 

![[descending white matter spinal cord.png]]
circled parts of the cervical SC 
![[cervical spinal cord tracts.png]]
red = corticospinal tract - major control of voluntary movment 
- primary vol motor info to skeletal muscles 
blue = rubrospinal tract - major control of voluntary movment 
- Primary regulates flexors of the upper body
yellow. =  tectospinal tract + medial vestibulospinal tract  - coordinate head + eye movements in response to visual stimuli 
-  Regulates movements of the shoulders and neck, in conjunction with information from the superior colliculus coordinates head and neck movements to allow tracking of visual targets
green = reticulospinal tract - motor tract act on motor neurons to trunk + proximal limb; postural control 
orange = lateral vestibulospinal tract = adjust the posture + balanc in repsonse to vestibular sensations 
-  Allows for use of vestibular information for non-conscious regulation of general overall balance.

corticospinal tract - initiates from motor cortex in brain 
- will send signals thru projections that desend via internal capsule, thru cerebral peduncles 
- getting to the medulla level, will **cross thru the decussation and into the lateral corticospinal tract**
- then activates in the ventral horn at the appropriate alpha motor neuron 

lateral and medial vestibulospinal tracts
- sensory info from vestibular organs (at level of ear) will be haivng semicircular canals + utricles and saccules 
- semicirc canals - rotational behaviors -> CN8 vestibulocochlear nerve -> medulla!!!
	- this will go into the **medial vestibular nuclei, then sending BILATERAL projections down the SC**
	- to the cervical levels of cord to aid in head and neck movement 
	- medial vestibular nuclei will **ALSO send ascending proj to oculomotor nuclei to help eye head neck movements coordinate**
- utricle and saccule - repsond to linear acceleration liek running -> going thru CN 8 but instead
	- at medulla **synapse at LATERAL vestibular nuclei, then down the ipsilateral tract**
	- down the spinal cord to aid in **truncal positioning and body positioning!**
