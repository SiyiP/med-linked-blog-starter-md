unconscious motor control 
decision making = premotor cortex - all stored info of decisions
limbic system - emotion + business + memory 
pyramidal system - execution of that function 

overview: 
vol motor control - starts in motor cortex = in some other areas, recall betz cells going down intrnal capsule thru cerebral peduncles (ventral midbrain aspect), then wiggling thru the pons protuberance anterior portion, down the medullary pyramids, down the lateral aspect of spinal cord + lateral columns all the way down to alpha motor neuron. 
- and everythig below that alpha motor neuron is the lower body! peripheral NS 

---
motor control - posture + tone - overview and general understanding 
beyond the Betz cells when we think of non-voluntary!!!
- voluntary motor system - pyramidal system
- invol: extrapyramidal system, cerebellum(separate lecture in future), basal ganglia(separate lec in future), striatum, substantia nigra, interneurons 
	- all the things that control movements and interneurons, other feedback loops 

1. extrapyramidal system - modulation of truncal tone, posture, balance, equilibrium, cooordination 
![[Screenshot 2025-09-28 at 3.45.34 AM.png]]
	- works and intercepts pyramidal system commanding or works off the return info from sensory systems
	-  **doesn't innervate the alpha neurons directly bc it's not pyramidal system**
	1. reticular formation - tracts are in midbrain, pons, medulla ... "all the stuff in between"
		1. ascending RF = speaks upwards to substantia nigra pars compacta .... thalamus and cortex too = these are "lights on"
		2. descending - helps with control + posture/tone
			1. rubrospinal = input is coming from cerebellum / cortex 
				1. seen **descending in latral columns of the spinal cord.** - can look a bit reddish when sliced;
				2. descends into lateral SC 
				3. helps the interneurons excite the **flexors, inhibit extensors, and upper limbs > lower limbs**
				4. crawling in babies, adult arm swinging  
			2. reticulospinal (pontine + medullary) - from pontine + medullary nuclei
				1. input comes from reticular formation 
				2. medial = pontine = **stimulate extensors of leg, stepping**
				3. lateral. = medullary  = **inhibit medial pontine to help flexors in leg, helps in stretch reflex + automatic breathing**
				4. posture + control of locomotion where **premotor locomotion center projects to the reticulospinal tract, and alternating med/pon and lateral/medullary input help with reciprocation**
				5. walking is an alternating type thing ^^
				6. pontine reticular formation - the "fuzzy area" between the medial lemiscus + abducens nucleus in the lower pons.... and 
				7. medullary reticular formation = in the middle medulla, will be in between the medial meniscus + the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus. hard to see these ): 
			3. vestibulospinal - input from vestibular nuclei
				1. project to lumbar spinal cord
				2. stimulate **extensors to help with posture**
				3. vestibulo-ocular reflex - **doll's eyes = eyes are fixed forward with head with turn in normal brain, but brainstem dysfunction has eyes rotate with head!!**
				4. this is one of the tests to prove brain death. 
			4. tectospinal - input from superior colliculus 
				1. axons coming from deep layers of superior clliculus (eye movements + gaze control)
				2. cross + descend near midline, synapsing on motor neurons in ventral horn of cervical segments, controlling neck + shoulder girdle muscles
				3. control saccades = quick simultaneous movement of 2 eyes between 2 focal points

recall that flexors are more lateral in cord - CST, rubrospinal, medullary retiulospinal 
and extensors = anteromedial = vestibulospinal, pontine, reticulospinal 
- these are 2 systems of balance
- medullary (lateral) reticular formation will **inhibit extensors**,  a lot of input from the motor cortex goes into this 
- pontine (medial) reticular formation will **facilitate extensors**
- lesions of corticospinal tracts will leave reticular influences unbalanced.... 
- vestibular nuclei = excites extensors
- rubrospinal tract = excite flexors

decorticate posturing = injury to one side of the balance, 
- lesion in **brainstem above the red nucleus**
- recall rubrospinal tract = more for arm flexin than for legs 
- if you slide off all the brainstem above - **get rid of all motor cortex function and feeding into stuff: so no more r**
