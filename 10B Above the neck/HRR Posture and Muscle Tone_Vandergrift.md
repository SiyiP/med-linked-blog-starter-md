#sensorimotor 

unconscious motor control 
==decision making = premotor cortex - all stored info of decisions==
==limbic system - emotion + business + memory== 
==pyramidal system - execution of that function== 

overview: 
vol motor control - starts in motor cortex = in some other areas, recall betz cells going down intrnal capsule thru cerebral peduncles (ventral midbrain aspect), then wiggling thru the pons protuberance anterior portion, down the medullary pyramids, down the lateral aspect of spinal cord + lateral columns all the way down to alpha motor neuron. 
- and everything below that alpha motor neuron is the lower body! peripheral NS

motor control - posture + tone - overview and general understanding 
==beyond the Betz cells when we think of non-voluntary!!!==
- ==voluntary motor system - pyramidal system==
- ==invol: extrapyramidal system, cerebellum(separate lecture in future), basal ganglia(separate lec in future), striatum, substantia nigra, interneurons== 
	- all the things that control movements and interneurons, other feedback loops 

1. ==extrapyramidal system - modulation of truncal tone, posture, balance, equilibrium, cooordination== 
==![[pyramidal and extrapyramidal nuclei.png]]==
	- works and intercepts pyramidal system commanding or works off the return info from sensory systems
	==-  **doesn't innervate the alpha neurons directly bc it's not pyramidal system**==
	==1. reticular formation - tracts are in midbrain, pons, medulla ... "all the stuff in between"==
		1. ==ascending RF = speaks upwards to substantia nigra pars compacta .... thalamus and cortex too = these are "lights on"==
		==2. descending - helps with control + posture/tone==
			==1. rubrospinal = input is coming from cerebellum / cortex== 
				1. seen ==**descending in lateral columns of the spinal cord.**== - can look a bit reddish when sliced;
				2. descends into lateral SC 
				==3. helps the interneurons excite the **flexors, inhibit extensors, and upper limbs > lower limbs**==
				3. crawling in babies, adult arm swinging  
			==2. reticulospinal (pontine + medullary) - from pontine + medullary nuclei==
				==4. input comes from reticular formation== 
				==4. medial = pontine = **stimulate extensors of leg, stepping**==
				==4. lateral. = medullary = **inhibit medial pontine to help flexors in leg, helps in stretch reflex + automatic breathing**==
				==4. posture + control of locomotion where **premotor locomotion center projects to the reticulospinal tract, and alternating med/pon and lateral/medullary input help with reciprocation**, like with walking is alternating==
				4. walking is an alternating type thing ^^
				==5. pontine reticular formation - the "fuzzy area" between the medial lemiscus + abducens nucleus in the lower pons.... and== 
				5. medullary reticular formation = in the middle medulla, will be in between the medial meniscus + the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus. hard to see these ): 
			==3. vestibulospinal - input from vestibular nuclei==
				==6. project to lumbar spinal cord==
				==6. stimulate **extensors to help with posture**==
				==6. vestibulo-ocular reflex - **doll's eyes = eyes are fixed forward with head with turn in normal brain, but brainstem dysfunction has eyes rotate with head!!**==
				6. this is one of the tests to prove brain death. 
			==4. tectospinal - input from superior colliculus== 
				7. axons ==coming from deep layers of superior colliculus (eye movements + gaze control)==
				8. ==cross + descend near midline, synapsing on motor neurons in ventral horn of cervical segments, controlling neck + shoulder girdle muscles==
				9. ==control saccades = quick simultaneous movement of 2 eyes between 2 focal points== 
==![[tectospinal and reticulospinal tract.png]]==

==recall that flexors are more lateral in cord - CST, rubrospinal, medullary retiulospinal== 
==and extensors = anteromedial = vestibulospinal, pontine, reticulospinal== 
- these are 2 systems of balance
- ==medullary (lateral) reticular formation will **inhibit extensors**,  a lot of input from the motor cortex goes into this== 
- ==pontine (medial) reticular formation will **facilitate extensors**==
- lesions of corticospinal tracts will leave reticular influences unbalanced.... 
- ==vestibular nuclei = excites extensors==
- ==rubrospinal tract = excite flexors==
==![[motor physiology extensors and flexors.png]]==
==M1 = motor cortex== 
==PRF = pontine (medial) reticular formation==
==VN = vestibular nuclei==
==MRF = medullary reticular formation== 
==RN = rubrospinal tract==


==decorticate posturing = injury to one side of the balance, severe the M1 large arrow that was going down to the **flexors as well as the MRF**==
- ==lesion in **brainstem above the red nucleus**, above the cerebral peduncles== 
- recall rubrospinal tract = more for arm flexin than for legs 
- if you slide off all the brainstem above - **get rid of all motor cortex function and feeding into stuff**
- ==predominant upper flexor and lower extremity extensor function== 
	- ==**rubrospinal intact = flexor of uppers** = high input of this with any stimulus== 
	- ==vestibulospinal and pontine reticulospinal intact = extensor of lower extremities are done== 
- if given a bit of stimulus, leg would extend, but rubrospinal tract would overcome that in the upper extremities  and make arms flex 
- **basically arms flexed, feet and legs pointed**

==decerebrate posturing== 
- ==lesions below the red nucleus== 
- basically cutting the arrow going from rn and downwards from the M1.... so basically no signals from RN, no signals from M1 directly to flexors,a nd no signal from M1 to mrf. 
- predominant extensors in both upper and lowr extremities
	- ==recall: **medullary reticular formation = near extensor UE and LE, so the fact that it's not here = no inhibition of extensor muscles.**==
- ==guy's laying down, extension of all limbs.==

cerebellum - The folia on the superior side appears to be a continuum across the surface, whereas on the inferior surface. They do not. In addition, the superior surface will be flat compared to the curved shape of the inferior side.
- Damage to the anterior lobe, which is largely contains the vermis, will cause the patient to stagger or sway from side to side and walks with a broad base, known as an ataxic gait.
- The primary fissure separates the anterior cerebellum (approx. 1/3 of the cerebellum) from the posterior cerebellum
- doens't start movement, but makes fine control + coordination 
- motor + sensory input (cortex, diencephalon brainstem, spinal cord)
- cerebellar folia = inc processing surface + deep nuclei inside it too 
1. ==cerebellar pedunles = where to carry information / where's it from?== 
	1. ==superior to thalamus to cortex==
	2. ==middle = to/from pons== 
	3. ==inferior to/from spinal cord + vestibular nuclei/reticular formation==

basal ganglia/striatum/substantia nigra 
- basal ganglia = deeper structure in the brain below the white matter, helping coordinate motor function and all that. 
	- striatum (dorsal + ventral) - input to all this, all the input is from the cortex to here. 
		- dorsal = caudate + putamen = 		- overall this is good for conscious motor movement and exec function control 
		- ventral = nucleus accumbens + olfactory tubercle  = limbic system reward. + aversion 
		- after this activation, it's inhibitory to basal ganglia and substantia nigra pars reticulata 
	- globus pallidus - input given is **inhibitory** from the striatum, outputting inhibitory stufff both GPi and GPe
		- externa version will output to the subthalamic nucleus , part of indirect pathway + inibits inhibitor which allows for inhibior excitation to reduce thalamic activity 
		- output interna to thalamus , art of direct pathway 
	- ventral pallidum 
	- subthalamic nucleus - output excitatory to globus pallidus interna and also excitatory to substantia nigra pars reticulata 
	- substantia nigra externa - will be dopaminergic modulatory from this to the striatum when they need to gt started. 
		- ==pars compacta = input from retic activating system, ascending collaterals.== 
		- output is still dopaminergc to the putamen/caudate
		- ==pars reticulata = **invol, from striatum + excitatory from STN** = output, will show that it's inhibitory to the trauma== 
		- ==The substantia nigra regulates/modulates the basal ganglia circuitry by releasing dopamine into the caudate and putamen (aka dorsal striatum).==
			-  A [white matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter "White matter") [nerve tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_tract "Nerve tract") (the [internal capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_capsule "Internal capsule")) in the dorsal striatum separates the caudate nucleus and the putamen.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum#cite_note-FERRE2010-4) Anatomically, the term _striatum_ describes its striped (striated) appearance of grey-and-white matter
			- The dorsal striatum can be further subdivided into the **dorsomedial striatum**, and the **dorsolateral striatum**. ==The dorsomedial region receives projections from the frontal and the parietal cortices. The dorsolateral region receives projections from the sensorimotor cortex==.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum#cite_note-Macpherson2019-15)
- lentiform nuclei = putamen + globus pallidus  
![[basal ganglia labeled side view.png]]
thalamus - top of the midbrain and then will relay info everywhere
basal ganglia right outside the **internal capsule = globus pallidus** and some stuff inside caudate + ventral and inf to thalamus = substantia nigras. 
![[basal ganglia anterior post view.png]]

caudate = seen deper inside 

note = cortex + substantia nigra pars compacta booth stim dorsal striatum, which wil then stim the basal ganglia 
- then either gaba or sn combo would enter or inibit
- this is implicated in nigrostriatal pathway = huge in parkingsons . dopamine issue. give dopamine or shocking

corticospinal tract - you still have spinal interneurons 
- more chance if there's not a single alpha motor neuron at the end - there's a lot of spinal interneurons
- gray matter of cord 
- rexed laminae 7+8, 
- all these interneurons are supposed to be for inhibitory help in this to make sure its not too bad
