reflexes = takeaway = ==alpha motor neuron downwards has a lot of modulation , spindles are **excitatory**, golgi stuff **inhibitory**, test with reflexes.==

reflex loops happen wit the alpha motor neuron lower body downwards 
==![[intrafusal muscle fibers.png]]==
==NMJ = connection bt alpha motor neuron + extrafusal m.== 

**==extrafusal muscle fiber = standard skeletal muscle fibers, makes bicep move==** 

==motor unit = alpha motor neuron + extrafusal muscle fiber it innervates + inherent spindles in muscle belly== 
- ==passive stretch = inc firing from spindle afferents==
- ==increase in activity of spindle afferent excites the **alpha motor neuron in the ventral horn of spinal cord**==
- ==alpha motor output to muscles then causes **contraction of extrafusal/regular skeletal muscle fibers + reduction of spindle afferent discharge, tends to regulate muscle length + tone homeostatically**==
- think abt if you hold a cup, and ur muscle stretching with that cup falling a bit, your muscle then is made to contract and hold onto the cup more 
- also we get reciprocal other muscle antagonist relaxation with one muscle contraction too 
	- stretch in msucle results in **contraction of it and synergists, but relaxation of antag groups**

==neuromuscular spindle - s**pecialized intrafusal muscle fibers + trimmings,** which **run in parallel to each other in muscle fibers**, **within** the muscle== 
- ==these will sense length ; **stretching a muscle = inc length of spindle, increasing afferent discharge
- intrafusal muscle fibers SENSE LENGTH, inc length of spindle and stretching stuff....**==

==intrafusal muscle fibers = skeletal muscle fiber that **serves as a sensory organ, determining rate + amt of change in extrafusal muscle fiber** = - muscle itself is like a sensory organ== 
- these are ==in parallel to extrafusal muscle fibers... with a capsule surrounding the smaller ones.== 
types of input: has to do with how the nuclei are 
- ==**dynamic** nuclear bag muscle fiber = type Ia sensory== 
	- ==afferents will twine around the center of these intrafusal fibers.== 
- ==**static** nuclear bag muscle fibers = type Ia and II sensory fibers==
- ==**nuclear** chain muscle fibers = type II sensory fibers== 
 

==intrafusal muscle motor innervation - is via **gamma motor neuron / fusiform neurons, which will only innervate this, maintaining sensitivity of muscle spindle mech**==
- these sensing intrafusal muscle fibers also has innervation to this which will make THEM contract. 
- ==this is their **efferent motor innervation**==
- ==these will be on **polar ends of intrafusal fibers,, since the central region willl lack actin/myosin**==
	- ==ends of fibers to contract, shortening it to maintain the right sensitivity to make it sensitive again to stretch!!!!==
	- ==**increase to muscle tone by reflex action + more sensitive to stretch.**==
	- ==descending inputs to gamma motor neurons allow CNS to set level of muscle tone, **subcontious, reticulospinal for instance**==

==note - there will be alpha-gamma coactivation....== 
- during voluntary contractions, ==if gamma motor axons are stimmed at same time as alpha motor axons, the spindle can continue to be sensitive to length thruout contraction.== 
- helps smooth out and maintain that afferent information, you're aware of how far youre moving 
- ==**extrafusal fibers. + spindles will shorten at the same rate, keeping the intrafusal ones responsive even during muscle shortening**==

==muscle spindle afferent sensory nerves - takes info away from muscle spindle== 
- ==primary type Ia = coils to make annulospiral ring, stretching of this will cause firing + **dynamic muscle length information** send, helps serve dynamic nuclear bag + static nuclear bag muscle fibers==
- ==secondary type II = responds to **sustained state** of muscle stretch , gives static muscle length info, serves static nuclear bag + nuclear chain muscle fibers==

==golgi tendon organ - situated at muscle-tendon interface, measures **tension** on muscle==
- ==**type Ib** sensory neurons will carry efferent info== 
- ==synapse on cord interneurons to inhibit alpha motor neurons== 
- different from muscle spindle, in the different location 
- ==tension - rate and amount of change. the strength of the pull on there.== 
- ==receptors have axon terminals **twined in tendon fibers at the end of muscle**==
	- ==strong response to contractile tension, weak to passive.== 
	- ==passive stretch = spindle afferents are highly active helping it contract, so the homonymous muscle contracts, but golgi tendon organ will have weak activity, no significant inhibition of homonymous muscle== 
	- ==active shortening = spindle afferents silent/unchanged, but these **golgi tendon organs will be highly activated , inhibiting the homonymous muscle**==
		- **these basically ==help you not overdo it!==! inhibition of this muscle and excitation of antagonists help:**
		- compensate for fatigue
		- spread load across other muscle fibers
		- reduce contraction and reduce in general to that alpha motor neuron set
		- **this is liek a negative feedback**

==reflex connection== 
- ==each reflex = specific set of affferents==
- ==1 or more interneurons== 
- ==alpha motor neurons to specific muscles==

so defect in reflex can be caused by afferent, efferents, or synaptic connections 

==the stretch reflex/myotatic reflex==
- ==knee jerk for instance==
- "deep tendon reflex"
- ==stimulus = **inc muscle length signaled by muscle spindles**==
- ==response: contraction of the **same muscle** / **homonymous** muscle== 
	- ==accompanied by the inhibition of motor neurons to the antag muscles== 

==flexion/withdrawal reflex - stepping on a nail== 
- ==stimulus = activate nociceptors with tissue dmg==
- then you ==contract muscles needed to move away from injury== 
- ==weak stim = activation of flxors at that closest joint==
- mod stim - activate neighboring flexor joints 
- ==larger stimulus = more muscles involved in response. ; **activation of extensors in opposite limb to support body = "crossed extension reflex"**==
- including reciprocal inhibitory connections 

==extensor thrust reflex==
- ==absent after 1 yo, pressure on foot bottom , extend leg out== 

plantar response
- scrape sole of foot
- infant dorsiflex + fan toes 
- ==mature no babinski sign, plantar flex toes (myeination of descending pathways)==
- ==**infant response returns after upper motor injury (babinski)**==

==spinal shock = loss of all reflexes below lesion== 
- ==immediately post injury + gradual recovery (spastcity happens)==
- sudden removal of descending pathways reduce facilitation of segmental reflexes. 

==upper motor neuron injury = spasticity== 
- ==alpha motor neurons are more **sensitive to muscle spindles over golgi tendon organs**==
- ==results: inc tension in muscles in general to passive movement = **inc tone!!!**==
- ==clasp-knife reflex, initially the inc in tone then the muscle gives away== 

==stretch reflex = muscle contracting due to fibers stretched = clinically tested== 
- ==muscle spindle function, poz feeback==
- ==sense change in length + controls it== 
- more sensitive than tendon reflex
- can be monosynaptic on alpha motor neuron 

vs
==tendon reflex = stretched muscles being told to relax via golgi tendon organ== 
- ==inhibitory feedback, from sense change in muscle tension + controls it== 
- senses with muscle contraction, **not passive movement, less sensitive**
- ==dropping weight that's too heavy while lifting== 

==look at these charts the most:==
==deep tendon reflexes==
- ==biceps C5,6==
- ==brachioradialis C6==
- ==triceps C7== 
- ==patellar L4== 
- ==achilles S1== 

additional ones to localize spinal cord lesions? 
- ==abdominal cutaneous reflex:==
	- ==above umbilicus T8-10== 
	- ==below: T10-12== 
- ==cremasteric L1-2== 
- ==bulbocavernosus S2-4== 
- ==anal wink S2-4== 

cranial nerves in comatose patient (idk)
- vision blink to threat CN2
- pupillary responses 2,3
- extraocular movements + vestibuloocular reflex : 3,4,6,8
- cornal reflex, facial asym, grimace CN 5,7
- gag CN 9,10 

==rhythmic movements like walking, chewing, scratching== 
- **==patterning of these = interconnections bt interneuron pools at segmental levels of spinal gray matter/brainstem reticular formation==** 
- ==initiation via descending tracts.== 

==central pattern generators - **local interneurons are capable of producing these patterned movements**==
- after the ==transection of SC, stepping patterns occur after stimulus, body weight supported, nonspecific stim to skin.== and preservation of fairly normal coordination
