reference powerpoint to come back to as u learn more
need to know postsynaptic effect, precursors + rate limiting enzymes (for pathology and drug targets.) . 
astrocytes = **has transporters to clear out the NTs**, and other enzymes like MAO in that cleft will help remove shit 
- **we don't have to learn type of vesicle!!!**
![[neurotransmitter summary table.png]]
- ligand gated ion channels - NT binds, opening it and allowing the flow 
- g-protein coupled receptors - NT binds , G protein will then activated, making effector protein get ion flow on. 

1. ACH - MSK junctions, neuromusc synapse bt **vagus nerve and cardiac factors + ganglia synapses of visceral motor system**
	1. origin in CNS = **basal nucleus of meynert**, in the basal forebrain, implicated and project to cerebral cortex + degen in alz dz
	2. brainstem nuclei - has cholinergic cells (don't have to know much, they just will project up into basal nucleus structures in the caudate nucleus)
	3. striatal interneurons = of the striatal region of the caudate nucleus, these are cholinergic cells and interneurons of this region (basal ganglia structure)
	4. synthesis with ChAT, pyruvate turned into acetyl coa, and choline present .... turned itnoo ACH and then transporters 
	5. termination via acetylcholinesterase + choline transporters.... 
	6. nicotinic (neuromuscular) + muscarinic (CNS more) receptors 
	7. attention, learning, memory , Parasyn control 
	8. path: myasthenia gravis - antibodies will fuck with the ACH receptors at NMj, preventing contraction... degen causes skeletal muscle weakness. treat with ACHe inhibitor
	9. path: alz dz = irreversible, **loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons**
2. glutamate - major excitatory NT, non-essential, precursor for GABA + don't cross BBB
	1. over 50% in CNS are this!!
	2. pathways bt thalamus + cortex
	3. extrapyramidal pahthway (projections bt cortex + striatum)
	4. bt cortex, substantia nigra(in brainstem), subthalamic nuc + pallidum 
	5.  need glutamine precursor (from astrocytes/glial cells) -> taken up into the presynaptic terminal, and then **glutaminate the rate limiiting enzyme produces it**
	6. **VGLUTS1-3 will take it into vesicles** 
	7. termination with EAATs - excitatory amino acid transporters on neurons + glia -> glutamate-glutamine cycle 
	8. PATH: excitotoxicity - not all inclusive 
		1. ALS
		2. stroke
		3. epileptic seizures
		4. Drug abuse/addiction 
		5. TREAT: NMDAR/mGLUR antagonists , stops it from binding to the receptors
