reference powerpoint to come back to as u learn more
need to know postsynaptic effect, precursors + rate limiting enzymes (for pathology and drug targets.) . 
astrocytes = **has transporters to clear out the NTs**, and other enzymes like MAO in that cleft will help remove shit 
- **we don't have to learn type of vesicle!!!**
==![[neurotransmitter summary table.png]]==
- ligand gated ion channels - NT binds, opening it and allowing the flow 
- g-protein coupled receptors - NT binds , G protein will then activated, making effector protein get ion flow on. 

1. ACH - MSK junctions, neuromusc synapse bt **vagus nerve and cardiac factors + ganglia synapses of visceral motor system**
	1. ![[ach pathway overview.png]]
	2. ==origin in CNS = **basal nucleus of meynert**, in the basal forebrain, implicated and project to cerebral cortex + degen in alz dz==
	3. brainstem nuclei - has ==cholinergic cells (don't have to know much, they just will project up into basal nucleus structures in the caudate nucleus)==
	4. ==striatal interneurons = of the striatal region of the caudate nucleus, **these are cholinergic cells** and interneurons of this region (basal ganglia structure)==
	5. ==synthesis with ChAT, pyruvate turned into acetyl coa, and choline present .... turned itnoo ACH and then transporters== 
	6. termination via acetylcholinesterase + choline transporters.... 
	7. nicotinic (neuromuscular) + muscarinic (CNS more) receptors 
	8. attention, learning, memory , Parasyn control 
	9. path: myasthenia gravis - antibodies will fuck with the ACH receptors at NMj, preventing contraction... degen causes skeletal muscle weakness. treat with ACHe inhibitor
	10. path: alz dz = irreversible, **loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons**
2. ==glutamate - major excitatory NT, non-essential, precursor for GABA + don't cross BBB==
	1. ![[glutamate pathway overview.png]]
	2. over 50% in CNS are this!!
	3. ==pathways bt thalamus + cortex==
	4. ==extrapyramidal pathway is this (projections bt cortex + striatum)==
	5. ==bt cortex, substantia nigra(in brainstem), subthalamic nuc + pallidum== 
	6.  need ==glutamine precursor (from astrocytes/glial cells) -> taken up into the presynaptic terminal, and then **glutaminate the rate limiting enzyme produces it**==
	7. **VGLUTS1-3 will take it into vesicles** 
	8. ==termination with EAATs - excitatory amino acid transporters on neurons + glia -> glutamate-glutamine cycle== 
	9. PATH: excitotoxicity - not all inclusive 
		1. ALS
		2. stroke
		3. epileptic seizures
		4. Drug abuse/addiction 
		5. TREAT: NMDAR/mGLUR antagonists , stops it from binding to the receptors 
3. GABA - major inhibitory, widely thruout CNS, in retina too + synthesized from glutamate
	1. ![[GABA pathway overview.png]]
	2. ==hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex + cerebellar for GABA== 
	3. interneurons are very large in brain 
	4. ==exists as both projection (cerebellar purkinje cells + basal ganglia neurons) and interneurons== 
	5. ==**glutamine/pyruvate** makes glutamate + glucose converted by **GAD to GABA**==
	6. ==GAD needs = **pyridoxal phsophate B6**==
	7. VGAT transporter will pack this into vesicles 
	8. A,,b,c are all receptors 
	9. GAT gaba transporters on glial cells and presynaptic terminal will recycle it 
	10. PATH: epilepsy, schizophrenia, tardive dyskinesia, dementia, sleep disorders, affective disorders (anxiety)
	11. treat: anti-epileptics, gaba receptor targets/antags, benzodiazepines, steroids, anesthetics 
4. ==serotonin - smooth muscle contraction like in gut, only 1-2% in brain==
	1. ![[serotonin pathway overview.png]]
	2. ==5-HT doesn't cross BBB, **so brain needs to make by istself**==
	3. ==tryptophan - primary substrate arises from diet ... -> T5H will convert to 5-hydroxytryptophan, and then to 5-HT by l-amino acid decarboxylase, serotonin!== 
	4. ==principal centers for this are **rostral and caudal RAPHE nuclei** (they're at midbrain in rostral and in caudal is descending down spinal cord - descending pain and transmission)== 
		1. raphe midline nuclei in brainstem 
	5. receptors are 5-HT3 and 5-HT1-7 .... and termination via SERT(recycling presynaptic terminal) and MAO (broken down by enzymes too)
	6. sleep , mood 
	7. path: pain, nociception, depression, EDs, circadian rhythm regulation , sleep disorders
	8. TREAT: ssris - inhibition of those serotonin transporters to make them stay for longer
5. ==catecholamines - dopa, NE, epi = created in that order, precursors of each other!==
	1. dopamine - movement, reward, emo expression. synthesized from tyr, and not cross BBB. neuromodulating - ==**both excitatory and inhibitory impact based on which receptor it binds to**==
		1. ![[dopa pathway overview.png]]
		2. transmitted in 3 pathways, 2 places of dopaminergic cells: substantia nigra of midbrain which projects into the striatal structure for movement. 
		3. ==ventral tegmentum area is the other dopaminergic cell area, will then project to the mesolimbic system, which is cognitive reward + emotional behaivor== 
		4. ==tuberoinfundibular system - neuronal control of hypothalmic pituatory endocrine system== 
		5. tyrosine -> Ldopa (treats parkingsons) -> dopamine must get stored in the vesicle (readily would autooxidize and cause stress.)
		6. termination via dopamine transporter DAT , MAO, and COMT
		7. D1 receptor = go pathway for movement
		8. D2 = inhibits movement pathway 
		9. path: dopamine degen = **parkinsons' disease... diminished substantia nigra** seen there. loss of that neuromelanin, which is a byproduct of the dopamine. 
	2. norepinephrine - peripheral sympathetic nn, fight or flight, also in attention, cognitiion, sleep, etc. ![[NE pathway overview.png|251x322]]
		1. ==NE in the CNS in the locus coeruleus in the **pons** which transmits to the cerebellum, sending up into the cortical areas.== 
		2. also in the caudal raphe sends descending projectings to the midbrain ... ? 
		3. ==DA converted to NE via dopamine b-hydroxylase DBH...== 
		4. this wil bind to alpha and beta receptors 
		5. NET, MAO, COMT will break it down 
		6. path: parkinsons (loss in conjunction to DA loss), alz, add/adhd, depression
		7. treat: NET inhibitors
	3. ==epi - some in there, nuclei:==
		1. ==lateral tegmentum + medulla, projecting into the medulla== 
		2. ==CNS function unknown== 
		3. need phenylethanolamine N-metyltransferase to convert NE to epi 
6. histamine - 
	1. ==histamine nuclei in hypothalamus!==
	2. ==histidine converted by istidine decarboxylase to this, packed by VMAT==
	3. H1-3 
	4. terminated by histidine methyltransferase + mao 
	5. ==arousal/attention, so antihistamines attack this causing symptoms like sedation== 

==peptide modulators - get coreleased with NTs, such as oxytocin and vasopressin, released with pain and stress==
- pain stress, emotion are all released with these. exps are oxytocin, vasopressin, etc. don't have to memorize yet 

==opioid peptides - widely in brain - coreleased with **serotonin + gaba**== 
- depressant effect
- modulate pain 
- ==endogenously released in response to stress, co-released with GABA to reduce substance P release + glutamate release from pain afferents in spinal cord.== 

==endocannabinoids - CB1+2, CB1 most common receptor in CNS==
- receptors all over the brain 
- ==THC reduces GABA transmission by binding to presynaptic CB1 receptors + hypothalamic receptors regulate appetite.== 
- ==cortical receptors disrupts short term memory== 
- ==produced by **enzymatic breakdown of membrane lipids with CNS**==
- ==**these are unconventional, released postsynaptically and have a presynaptic effect on terminal!**==
