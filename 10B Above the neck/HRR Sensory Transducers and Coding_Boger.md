#sensorimotor 
intracranial procedure - pts are awake, will be asking qs to hit prominent sites 
- brain - doesnt rlly have the receptors that some other things have. 

dorsal column **medial lemniscus pathway** - will take info about body movements and proprioception thru the dorsal root ganglion into the SC 
- fibers ascend to the brain stem
- **at the brain stem, it will cross contralateral to the other side** to the somatosensory corteex 

anterolateral pathway - ALS pathway 
- relays **pain and temperature to somatosensory cortex**
- ascending pathway 

==sensory unit receptive field - will have that receptors, with peripheral terminal w receptors==
- all the receptor endings in receptive field
- ==many **are specialized, if there's something for one thing, they won't have another, like for pain or whatever**==

sensory transduction of afferent fiber
- ion channels closed before generation or AP stimulation 
==basically -== 
1. ==membrane stretches==
2. ==ion channel open== 
3. ==depending on stimulus, we gt a generator potential -> AP when it's threshold ->== 
4. ==sends info to CNS== 

what info is AP coding?
- stimulus type  - modality - can be divided into submodalitles, which send a diff AP code to specific regions of the CNS ==even tho they're rlly specific, the sensory cells are all adjjacent units to each other.== 
	- ==thermoreceptors (heat)==
		- cold v warm 
		- ==warm starts firing off at 30 and more degrees==
		- ==then pain above 45 C... **warm receptors stop acting and then nociceptors start.**==
		- ==cold will have a broader temp range, **steadily discharge with inc firing at 20-30**==
		- ==then nociceptors act where it turns off at certain times. like <15 C== 
	- ==chemoreceptors (taste)==
		- sour, bitter, sweet 
		- ==taste buds, in the oral cavity, very very selective.== 
		- ==olfactory receptors in the nasal cavities, just be aware they exist==
	- ==mechanoreceptors (touch)- on skin surface AND viscera (eexpansion of tummy+bladder) -> somatosensory cortex== 
		- in difff layers of skin responding to touch and pressure
	- ==nociceptors (pain) -> solitary nucleus in the brainstem== 
		- ==free nerve endings==
		- ==not myelinated==
		- locatted almost. everywhere
		- any injury or insult to tissue activates these
		- **==use glutamate and substance P as NTs==**
		- ==**respond to intense everything like mechanical deformation, excessive heat/cold**==
		- ==dmg cells will release - **histamine, bradykinin, cytokines, prostoglandins**==
	- ==photoreceptors (light) -> occipital lobe== 
- intensity 
	- stronger the stimuli = greater the generator potential is , **higher freq AP!!!!**
	- helps distinguish a strong stim from weak stem, where strong = many APs, frequent firings. , more receptors recruitments can send that info into the brain 
- location 
	- usually named for them 
	- ==exteroreceptors - big for the pathways, these detect on the surface of body - touch, hair movements, etc.== 
	- ==enteroceptors - inside body== 
	- ==proprioceptors - related to muscles/joints==
	- ==teleceptors - at a distance from body = sight , hearing, etc - stuff not rlly touching body== 
	- receptive fields - can test ,**acuity** = 2 point discrimination test - 
		small receptive fields - **high receptor density like in hand**; high acuity 
		large receptive fields - has **low density** like on your back; low acuity 
	- ==lateral inhibition - helps stimulation localization - when u take a pencil tip and displace that skin, as you keep poking that central location it can stretch and impact other neighbor cells too, but the **central cell activated will send inhibitory signals to neighbor cells**==
		- single signal from the central cell being activated will be the only one that can help you pinpoint that 
		- shuts down the neighbors to make sure we only send that one signal. 
- duration - 2 mechanisms 
	- ==rapidly adapting stimuli - like vibration from a cell phone on ur body ringing== 
		- will cause the action potentials and then eventually you don't notice that anymore with the ==APs going down while the stimulus is constant==
		- ==basically AP stops suddenly, until it stops, then it sends a short one== 
	- ==slowly adapting stimuli - the profe standing up  , maintaining the posture== 
		- ==signal will stay and then AP continues to fire??== 
		- AP will still fire. 
somato sensory afferents
- ==proprioception - inside the muscle spindle receptors, large axons and all that myelin , high conduction velocity; Ia and II cells== 
	- where we are in space, theres 2 diff populations 
		- ==inside muscle spindle - "self receptor"- intrafusal fibers surrounded by CT capsule, where we detect any stretch in our muscle tensions, sending info into brain==
		- ==golgi tendon organs - low threshold mechanorecpeotrs.==
			- **found sepcifically ==in tendons, help prevent hyperflexion of joints, preventing overuse of them!!**==
			- ==associated wit reflexes== 
- ==touch = merkel, meissner, pacinian, ruffini cells, 2nd largest and fastest , are A-beta cells - medium ones associated with touch======
	- ==meissner corpuscle - near epidermis but not quite in there, **vibrations** , phasic type, once it hits a time, APs will dissipate==
	- ==merkel cells = will be **sharp** activations, grabbing the papillae of the epidermis and pain receptors also while you cut thru those free nerve endings in the epidermis== 
	- ==ruffini - in the **dermis, deeper**, responsive to **stretch**==
	- ==pacinian corpuscle = these are **deep vibrations, almost in the subq layer**, like jackhammers rather than phone calls.== 
- ==pain/temp = free nerve endings, A-delta, 3rd smallest== 
	- thesea re in the epidermis 
	- thermoreceptors - warm v cold are separate 
- ==pain, temp, and itch = free nerve endings, we see C nerves; A-delta and C== 
	- in epidermis
