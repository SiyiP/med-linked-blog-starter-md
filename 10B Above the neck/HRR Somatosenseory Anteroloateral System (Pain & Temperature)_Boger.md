purple v blue v red - follow these  
==trunk layers onto leg, arms layer onto trunks.== 
- ==basically body does a flip when you get to that cortex.== 
==**note - the ALS pathway is the spinothalamic tract.**== 
- name = shows it begins in the spine, termination in the thalamus 
- for pain and temp
- ==nociceptors - smaller diameter, no myelination, slow speed = pain is free nerve endings.== 

neuronal basis of pain 
- know that we have specialized receptors which respond to this, activated in extreme conditions or trauma. transmitted with heat stimulus - see some stimulus
	- ==activation of thermoreceptors first== 
	- then when u get to 45 degrees, nociceptors start AP signalling. higher activation of these. 
==there's also extreme mechanosensations that activate pain fibers, so many **axons are polymodal.**==

early v late pain perception 
sharp vs burning pain - they are together! 
- ==stabbing/pricking, well-localized - activation of **alpha delta fibers = first pain responses!** -over time, those fibers go to rest==,
- ==then will be **activating the C fibers, which are not the sharp feeling but more burning**==
- the pipeline of sharp to burning 
- ==first pain a-delta , and 2nd pain is c-fiber==
- ==c fibers = paleospinothalamic = deep, aching, poorly localized, in all mammals. projections to the intralaminar thalamus, hypothalamus, association cortex + promotes affective and emotional and hypothalamic responses==
- ==a-delta = neospinothalamic - in primates, many projections to VP thalamus + SS cortex, conscious perception+discrimination of pain==...  

the actual ALS pain and temperature
- inputs from ofc nociceptors + thermoreeptors, small, slowly conducting, **polymodal** phenomenon. 
- lower peripheral receptor density + **larger receptive fields**
pathway - 
1. 1st order neurons enter + synapse in ipsilateral dorsal horn, startign from dorsal root ganglia 
	1. as they enter into the spinal cord, apply the knowledge that they synapse immediately at the spinal cord, entering by the lateral part of dorsal root 
	2. either way, we will cross at that level into the contralateral side into the anterolateral white matter column. 
	3. pain and temp axons from thoracic synapses in dorsal horn, then crossing to ALS level to ascend. 
2. 2nd order neurons **cross to ascend** via contralateral anterolateral tracts to the ==**VP thalamus, medial thalamus + hypothalamus + brainstem reticular formation**==
	1. as we rise==, legs stay lateral, arms stay medial before the midbrain== 
	2. and when we get to the **midbrain, we change the legs will become DORSOLATERAL to the arms, behind a bit** - 
	3. ==at the VPL (ventral posterior nucleus)==
3. **some** 3rd order neurons project to postcentral gyrus 
	1. lower body sensation to the medial aspect of somatosensory cortex 
	2. upper body to the middle 
	3. ==while you're at the midbrain, the **legs are still lateral, arms still medial and so on... only at this third order from the midbrain to cerebrum you flip it for the SC!**==
	4. and facial to the lateral side of somatosensory cortex
4. ==face with this ALS path== is completely diff
	1. ==trigeminal n== -> enters into the **pons; don't synapse, but will DESCEND into the spinal trigeminal nucleus, in the rostral medulla.**
		1. trigeminal nucleus - actually goes thru multiple layers of the brainstem! **a long sausage that's standing up between the pons and medulla** - developmental phenomenon. 
		2. ==mechanosensory stuff will enter thru the pons level of it (**principal trigeminal nucleus**) , since the mechanosensory fibers (for the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway) is at pons== 
		3. ==but pain and temp side of things is only at the level of the rostral medulla. (**will synapse at spinal nucleus of V within the medulla**)==
	2. ==when activated, the medulla those will send signals to the **contralateral side**==
	3. ascends to thalamus + most lateral side of the SC

==parallel pain pathways==
2 aspect + experience of pain???
- anterolateral system will take it to:
	- ==sensory discriminative = basically location, intensity, quality. this goes to the **VPN ventral posterior nucleus** of thalamus before going to the SC== 
	- ==affective motivational = **fear/anxiety**, will take it to so many different places==
		- ==amygdala==(emotional center, fear), hypothalamus(hormonal), ==periaqueductal gray(**PAG, nucleus around cerebral aqueduct, modulates pain input)**,== ==superior colliculus(**spino**tectal** pathway, **visualize** where that's coming from , put your eyes on it)==, ==reticular formation(visceral response to stimuli, **nausea and throwing up**)== = various brainstem regions 
		- also sends to higher cortical regions = ==**midline thalamic nuclei - **==
			- ==memory: anterior cingulate cortex==
			- ==insular cortex== 

think about lesion effects:
nociceptive and mechanosensory pathways will travel thru one path of the SC 
- left side of the spinal cord - see the L side of body 
- if we lesion the thoracic L spinal cord,,, we know
	- right sid eof body pain/temp reduction 
	- L side of body mechanosensation reduction... of 2 point discrim, vibration, proprioception 
- and a **complete loss of sensation.**
	- this is bc the lesion's dorsal root input **slightly below that lesio**n (dorsal root pairs all this sensation together) at that level so we have complete loss at this segment!!!!
- **normal sensation from the lesion upwards bc upper body stuff comes in at different point**

referred pain 
- only deep pain can be referred!!!!
- ==**deep visceral pain will localize to body surface** , referred pain==
- fibers from viscera are entering into spinal cord at dermatome levels 
- ==happens bc info from multiple nocicepter afferents converges into individual spinothalamic tract nerve fibers.== 
- suspct this when there's no external view things at that point of ur limbs

==dorsal column pathway for visceral pain?== 
- ==those nociceptive things will travel in thru the dorsal root ganglion + synapse in that gray matter==
- **surprisingly, those things will travel thru the dorsal column instead** , ==all the way to the medulla==
- ==depending on the plae, on the gracili and or cudeate nuc...== 
- this iwll be sent to the dorsal column nuclei.. surprising. 
- ==**visceral pain will travel more thru the dorsal column pathway than the ALS, but misinterpreted as pain bc it goes thru the dermatome levels**==
- chronic visceral pain - might lesion the very medial aspect of the dorsal column, cutting off that ascending fibers that carry that information 
	- **midline myelotomy - very dangerous**

==we have descending systems to **modulate that ascending pain signals**==
- sending ==descending signals from SSC to amygdala + hypothalamus==
- then they ==send it to midbrain periaqueductal gray== 
- that will ==send signals into the parabrachial nuc, reticular formation, locus coeruleus, raphe nuc== 
- sending it ==all back into the **dorsal horn of spinal cord, then the anterolateral system**==
	- ==analgesic modulation - neurons with GABA inhibits glutamate/substance P ; body's way to shut down pain for at least a little so ur body can get away== 
- gate theory of pain: debated... more local regulation 
	- mechanoreceptor activation at the site will modulate transmission to higher centers... 

==peripheral sensitization (local response) vs central sensitization (CNS response to pain)==
- ==in local response = hyperalgesia = from release of variety of chems by dmg'd cells + tissues near the injury== 
	- these will ==**decrease threshold for activation of nociceptors or just directly activate them**==
	- like squidward's broken arm 
	- ==**allodynic responses = pin provoked even due to stimuli that doesn't usually cause pain**== 

pathology: 
syringomyelia - cyst grows at the central canal at the spinal cord 
- enlargement of that central canal of spinal cord
- gray matter, horns placed more latera
- **loss of pain + temperature sensation bilaterally from ARMS**
- legs and trunk stay normal in pain adn temp - 
- recall: the dorsal horns for the ALS needs to send that neurons **across the gray matter to the other side**
- normal dorsal column medial meniscus bc it's not crossing the entire gray matter from the dorsal horn at the entry of the SC, will instead go to the dorsal column 
	touch, proprioception, vibraiton, etc will not be impacted, except maybe
	- weakened motor control slightly below lesion tho 
- ultimately this can be fixed....

neuropathic pain + pain disorders
- hyperactivity of neurons associated in pain pathways - in the absence of nociceptor stimulation 
- usually stabbing, burning quality 
- ex) 
	- peripheral n 
	- dorsal rooot ganglion
	- spinal nerves
	- spinal cord
	- etc etc 
- pathophys - a huge slew - many parts of the ALS can be impacted

path: hyperpathia - in the future lectures??
