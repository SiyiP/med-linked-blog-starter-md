DCML pathway 
somatosensation - stimulation on body surface + deep tissues - sensory systems encode: modality, location, intensity, duration. 

note - primary somatosensory cortex is:
- parietal lobe, posterior to central sulcus, aka it is the **post-central gyrus!!!!**
information originates from surface + deep tissues
- touch, pressure, vibration, proprioception, pain and temp all get processed here. 
2 pathways
- dorsal column lemniscal pathway - touch, pressure proprioception sends projections up into the somatosensory cortex. 
- anterolateral system pathway - pain, temp - ALS 

primary afferant axons will project to spinal cord ipsilaterally 
then activity transfered to cortex by 3 relay neurons. 
**in the brainstem!!! all fibers cross contralateral side of brain**

neurons involved:
- primary afferent neuron - dorsal root ganglion cell
- brain stem neuron , 2nd order
- 3rd neuron in the thalamus, which relays to the somatosensory cortex 

how they're diff : dorsal column v ALS
1. where they cross/relay nucleus -
	1. dorsal column - touch, pressure vibration will stay ipsilateral in the brainstem and synapse in the medulla 
		1. ascending fibers = dorsal column = **mechanosnsation, dorsal column ascending via the namesake**
		2. larger fibers
		3. **gracil**
	2. als - will synapse locally at the level of entry, and then **activate the dorsal horn cells, which will then activate and send signals that cross and THEN ascend.**
		1.  ALS fibers ascend via the **LATERAL column of spinal cord** - a lesion to the lateral column causes a loss in pain and temp on the contralateral side. 
		2. smaller fibers 
2. similar afferents from head enter the brainstem via CN V / trigeminal n 

spinal cord - sensory receptors will project into ipsilateral dorsal horn - dorsal roots are seen to connect
- **large afferents** - mechanoreceptors will ascend via ipsilateral dorsal column 
	- or make reflex connections in ventral horn 
- **small** afferents, pain and temp not as well myelinated, will synapse in **superficial dorsal horn, and then secondary axons crossing immediately to ascend in anterolateral column, which is contralateral**
