DCML pathway 
somatosensation - stimulation on body surface + deep tissues - sensory systems encode: modality, location, intensity, duration. 

note - primary somatosensory cortex is:
- parietal lobe, posterior to central sulcus, aka it is the **post-central gyrus!!!!**
information originates from surface + deep tissues
- touch, pressure, vibration, proprioception, pain and temp all get processed here. 
2 pathways
- dorsal column lemniscal pathway - touch, pressure proprioception sends projections up into the somatosensory cortex. 
- anterolateral system pathway - pain, temp - ALS 

primary afferant axons will project to spinal cord ipsilaterally 
then activity transfered to cortex by 3 relay neurons. 
**in the brainstem!!! all fibers cross contralateral side of brain**

neurons involved:
- primary afferent neuron - dorsal root ganglion cell
- brain stem neuron , 2nd order
- 3rd neuron in the thalamus, which relays to the somatosensory cortex 

how they're diff : dorsal column v ALS
1. where they cross/relay nucleus -
	1. dorsal column - touch, pressure vibration will stay ipsilateral in the brainstem and synapse in the medulla - **great for relay things below the neck**
		1. ascending fibers = dorsal column = **mechanosnsation, dorsal column ascending via the namesake**
		2. larger fibers
		3. **gracile fasciculus** - tract that takes things from legs + trunk - **inside the dorsal column, to the medial side**
		4. cuneate fasciculus - tract that carries info from the arms ; **inside dorsal column, more lateral side**;; created by more and more layers that come as you move up in the body... 
	2. als - will synapse locally at the level of entry, and then **activate the dorsal horn cells, which will then activate and send signals that cross and THEN ascend.**
		1.  ALS fibers ascend via the **LATERAL column of spinal cord** - a lesion to the lateral column causes a loss in pain and temp on the contralateral side. 
		2. smaller fibers 
		3. in the lateral system, anterolateral tract.... carrying contralateral pain and temp 
			1. anterolateral tracts will also carry and include spinothalamic and spinoreticular pathways. 
2. similar afferents from head enter the brainstem via CN V / trigeminal n 

on the outer part of the SC... theres
- dorsal spinocerebellar tract - this is on the lateral dorsal side = **info to cerebellum abt strength, rate of muscle contraction**
- ventral spinocerebellar tract - info about effects of descednign signals, propioception, less known 

spinal cord - sensory receptors will project into ipsilateral dorsal horn - dorsal roots are seen to connect
- **large afferents** - mechanoreceptors will ascend via ipsilateral dorsal column 
	- or make reflex connections in ventral horn 
- **small** afferents, pain and temp not as well myelinated, will synapse in **superficial dorsal horn, and then secondary axons crossing immediately to ascend in anterolateral column, which is contralateral**


the dorsal column - pathway based on where the input is coming from 
- large myelinated axons for touch, vib, pressure, proprioceptin , so rapid velocity 
- single modality cells are thruout the pathway, 1st order neurons will enter and ascend ipsilatral in dorsal columsn to synapse in medullary nuclei 
	- **lower** body fibers (in purple) will enter and ascend medial thru **gracile tract, synapsing into gracile nucleus of medulla**
	- **upper** body fibers go lateral thru **cuneate tract** to synapse in **cuneate nuc of medulla**
	- facial fibers = **enter via CN V trigeminal N to synapse in primary trigeminal nuc of PONs** 
- 2nd order neurons cross to ascend via contralateral medial lemniscus to VP thalamus ; this happens in the **rostral medulla**
	- medial lemniscus - large ascending bundle of heavily myelinated axons that cross in the medulla oblongata ... made by internal arcuate fiber crossings (and those fibers = made up of axons of gracile nuc + cuneat nuc)
	- 2nd order axons cross by **internal arcuate fibers**, making the **contralateral medial lemnicus**
	- when it's traveling, note that in the midbrain:
		- **info from legs travel dorsolateral to information from the face.** - think legs out lateral, face is medial. configuration is organized 
- 3rd order to the postcentral gyrus/somatosensory cortex - **synapse in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus VP**
	- body synapses within the VPL (lateral)
	- face synapses int he VPM (medial)
	- ==question - why does facial nerves synapse with the VPM if it's gonna be the most lateral??==
![[dorsal column pathway levels.png|210x252]]
when the thalamus gets that information, will relay it via the internal capsule 
 - this is a white matter bundle in the brain
 - ascending somatosensory axons travel in the posterior portion of posterior limb of the internal capsule
 - ![[midbrain internal capsule somatosensory org.png|238x336]] confusing img?? 
 - F = face, A = arm, T = trunk, L = legs 
 - white matter bundle internal capsule = the v shape you see the FATL sit in (posterior limb), anterior limb is above. 

legs = medial of somatosensory cortex
body = over the dorsal surface of SS cortex
arms = further lateral
face = most lateral 
![[somatosensory cortex organization]]
- axons from the VP project to the homunculus of S1 cortex post-central somatosensory cortex w mechanceptive info from legs relayed to medial aspect of hemisphere and from the face to lateral aspect of hemisphere 
many information for the hands, the lips, etc. legs have very large receptive fields, so not that high of acuity. 

"somatotopic plasticity"
- we cannot inc the amt of cells, but **strengthen the synaptic connections**
- differential stimulation or repetitive tactile motion - we see more and more activity incrase - range of which the cortex can detec thtat 
- and following injury, tactile stimulating fragments will show strengthening in the representation of those fingers in their brain 
- repetitive use is the key? you have to be moving 

central pathways - conveys **unconscious proprioceptive info from the body**
- afferent fibers going thru dorsal root ganglion into the spinal cord 
- all of these will be going thru dorsal columns at first, **enters into the dorsal column from ganglion**
- carrying from the **lower body: this will be priorioception synapsing in the clarke's nucleus at T10**
	- clarkes nuc is in the **lumbar spinal cord, T10!!!**
	- this will have 2nd order axons which will go ispilaterally by dorsal **spinocerebellar tract, ascending in the lateral column, into the cerebellum**
- from **upper body**, some mechanoreceptors will **leave dorsal columns, traveling thru the cuneate tract and synapsing in the external cuneate nucleus of medulla** 
	- 2nd order axon project ipsilaterally thru **inferior cerebellar peduncle to cerebellum**
	- the external cuneate nucleus would **relay mechanosensory info from cervical region of SC to cerebellum**
- ascending into the cerebellum for it to correct any movemnt infrmtion, it will send information to the motor cortex. 

conscious proprioception = voluntary movement due to stimulus, cerebrum. - **dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway**
unconscious proprioception - activate muscle invol to a stimulous - cerebellum, **dorsal spinocerebellar tract + ventral spinocerebellar tract**

dorsal intermediate sulcus - ending at T2, this whole thing exists in the dorsal column to separate gracile from cuneat fasciculi 

 The _quadrigeminal plate_, also known as the _tectal plate_ or tectum, is constituted by the superior and inferior colliculi.
