some flexibility at the spinal column 
and vertebrae are diff
- 7 C
	- the spinal processes 2-6 have bifid spinsous process + transverse foramen, which will be **vertebral arterie passes as they ascend**
- 12T - spinous process goes infrior slope + articular facets with ribs 
- 5L  - large and prominent broad vertebral processs. = huge bc big weight bearers 
- sacrum 
spinal nerve passes as they exit = intervertebralf foramen 

external view of spinal cord
- in adults end conus medularris L1/2  
- at birth, majority of cells are present, 
- spinal roots and nerves exit below corresponding vert except in C1-7 which exit above (7 vertebrae but like 8 spinal nervs,with c8 exiting below)
- lumbar puncture - direct acess to **subarachnoid space of lumbar cistern = 4th and 5th L vertebra.**

spinal meninges 
- dura, arachnoid (both dura + this ends S2), pia (ends L1 with the filum terminale)

==1 spinal segment - bilateral attachment of both ventral and dorsal roots to the cord at one spinal level==
we have 31 segments 
- rootlets attach as a fan converging to make roots - 
	- dorsla roots afferent; cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglion 
	- ventral roots aefferent , bodis in ventral horn gray matter. 

dorsal median septum (little notch)
ventral median fissure 

white matter - this is asc/desc axons bt spinal cord+ brain subdivided based on attchment sites for nerve roots
- dorsal columns = asc 
- lateral columns= both 
- ventral columns= desc 
organized into columns based on the gray mattera. 

cervical and lumbar enlargements = **to supply ==limbs==**
C5-T2, and L2-S1
- relatively more white matter in upper/rostral cord bc **inc in ==ascending axons!!! accumulates at higher levels!==**
- in caudal cord - we have more gray matter 

gray matter - bodies of neurons **and glia** - can be mapped with nissl stain 
- sensory neurons - in dorsa 
- motor = in ventral, axons leave via ventral n root
- interneurons - **throughout the gray matter, interconnecting the two.**
this matter is divided into 3 regions - dorsal, **intermediolateral cell column (pertains to autonomic motor neurons** and ventral
- ==t1-2 lvls = **sympathetic preganglionic neurons -> white ramus to the sympathetic trunk**==
- ==S2-4 = **parasympathetic preganglionic neurons**==
- this is lowkey on the lateral horn of the thoracic segment - will have autonomic motor neurons giving rise to the preganglionic fibers of the sympathetic nervous system. 
	- recall these are S2-4 motor neurons of the spinal cord 
- 

topographically organized
==motor neurons that are innervating the trunk - more media of ventral horn== 
==to more distal muscles (like forearms, lower leg) ones - more lateral part o the ventral horn== 

C3-5 = **breathing - motor neurons of phrenic nerve**
supplemental motor neurons S1-4 = **onuf's nucleus somatic innervation to bladder, bowel, sexual function**

white matter - 
- dorsla oclumn, cuneate and gracile tracts, somatic sensory to the brain , medial to dorsal horn, ascending axon 
- ventral column descneding fibers for motor contro - from cerebral peduncles, pyramids. descneding motor ones. 

ascending white matter = all have cell bodies of origin fro mdorsal root ganglion
- dorsal columsn - mechanosensory info - 
	- gracile fasciculus - from legs + trunks 
	- cuneate fasiculus - from arms
- dorsal spinocerebellar tract - conveys info to cerebellum abt str, rate of muscle contraction 
- ventral spinocerebellar tract - info about effects of motor descending signals, and unconscious proprioception 
- anteriolateral tracts - pain + temp senses. +includes spinothalamic and spinoreticular pathways 

![[ascending white matter organization.png]]

descending white matter tracts
- corticospinal nad rubrospinal tracts - major cotrol of motor neurons + voluntary movements
- vestibulospinal tracts - adjust posture + balanc in response t vesticular sensations
- reticulospinal tract - act on motor neurons to trunk + prox limb k, postural control 
- tectospinal tract - coordinate head + eye movements in response to visual stimuli 
![[descending white matter spinal cord.png]]

spinal cord - will get blood supply from vertebral a, from the subclavian then the brachiocephalic 
- anterior spinal a + ppsterior spinal arteries are branches of the vertebral a 
**vasocorona - anastomotic connections bt both branches that ENCIRCLE the cord**
