some flexibility at the spinal column 
and vertebrae are diff
- 7 C
	- the spinal processes 2-6 have bifid spinous process + transverse foramen, which will be **vertebral arteries passes as they ascend**
- 12T - spinous process goes infrior slope + articular facets with ribs 
- 5L  - large and prominent broad vertebral process = huge bc big weight bearers 
- sacrum 
spinal nerve passes as they exit = intervertebral foramen 

external view of spinal cord
- in adults end conus medularis L1/2  
- at birth, majority of cells are present, 
- spinal roots and nerves exit below corresponding vert except in C1-7 which exit above (7 vertebrae but like 8 spinal nerves, with c8 exiting below)
- ==lumbar puncture - direct access to **subarachnoid space of lumbar cistern = 4th and 5th L vertebra.**==

spinal meninges 
- dura, arachnoid (both dura + this ends S2), pia (ends L1 with the filum terminale)

==1 spinal segment - bilateral attachment of both ventral and dorsal roots to the cord at one spinal level==
we have 31 segments 
- rootlets attach as a fan converging to make roots - 
	- dorsla roots afferent; cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglion 
	- ventral roots aefferent , bodis in ventral horn gray matter. 

==dorsal median septum (little notch)==
==ventral median fissure== 

white matter - this is asc/desc axons bt spinal cord + brain subdivided based on attachment sites for nerve roots
- dorsal columns = asc 
- lateral columns= both 
- ventral columns= desc 
organized into columns based on the gray mattera. 

cervical and lumbar enlargements = **to supply ==limbs==**
==C5-T2, and L2-S1==
- relatively more white matter in upper/rostral cord bc **inc in ==ascending axons!!! accumulates at higher levels!==**
- in caudal cord - we have more gray matter 

==gray matter - bodies of neurons **and glia** - can be mapped with nissl stain== 
- sensory neurons - in dorsas                                                                                                              
- motor = in ventral, axons leave via ventral n root
- ==interneurons - **throughout the gray matter, interconnecting the two.**==
==this matter is divided into 3 regions - dorsal, **intermediolateral cell column which is lowkey on the lateral horn of the thoracic segment.. and the sacral (pertains to autonomic motor neurons** and ventral==
- ==t1-2 lvls = **sympathetic preganglionic neurons -> white ramus to the sympathetic trunk**==
- ==S2-4 = **parasympathetic preganglionic neurons**==
- this is lowkey on the lateral horn of the thoracic segment - will have autonomic motor neurons giving rise to the preganglionic fibers of the sympathetic nervous system. 
	- recall these are S2-4 motor neurons of the spinal cord 

topographically organized
motor neurons that are innervating the **trunk** - more medial of ventral horn 
to more distal muscles (like forearms, lower leg) ones - more lateral part o the ventral horn 

C3-5 = **breathing - motor neurons of phrenic nerve**
==supplemental motor neurons S1-4 = **onuf's nucleus somatic innervation to bladder, bowel, sexual function**==

white matter - 
- dorsla column, cuneate and gracile tracts, somatic sensory to the brain , medial to dorsal horn, ascending axon 
- ventral column descneding fibers for motor contro - from cerebral peduncles, pyramids. descneding motor ones. 

ascending white matter = all have cell bodies of origin from dorsal root ganglion
- dorsal columsn - mechanosensory info - 
	- gracile fasciculus - from legs + trunks 
	- cuneate fasiculus - from arms
- dorsal spinocerebellar tract - conveys info to cerebellum about str, rate of muscle contraction 
- ventral spinocerebellar tract - info about effects of motor descending signals, and unconscious proprioception 
- ==anterolateral tracts - pain + temp senses.== 
- includes spinothalamic and spinoreticular pathways 

![[ascending white matter organization.jpeg|360x483]]

descending white matter tracts
- ==corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts - major control of motor neurons + voluntary movements==
- vestibulospinal tracts - adjust posture + balance in response t vesticular sensations
- ==reticulospinal tract - act on motor neurons to trunk + proximal limb, postural control== 
- ==tectospinal tract - coordinate **head + eye** movements in response to visual stimuli==

spinal cord - will get blood supply from vertebral a, from the subclavian then the brachiocephalic 
- anterior spinal a + ppsterior spinal arteries are branches of the vertebral a 
==**vasocorona - anastomotic connections bt both branches that ENCIRCLE the cord**==
