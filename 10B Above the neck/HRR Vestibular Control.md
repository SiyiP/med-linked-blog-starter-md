vestibulospinal tract
 - uniqu - takes sensory info in about proprioeption then the motor respponse
 - this is all about postural and tone regulating pathway **initiated by taking in information from periphery**
look into the auditory system - vestibular systems = of the inner ear: labyrinth
- labyrinth:
	- 3 semicircular canals = responds to **angular/rotational accleration, depol on the side ur spinnin, hyperpolarize on th other side**
		- hair cells are located in the ampulla (bump at the end of the semicircular canal)
		- inside ampula we have a cupula, and inside it is where the stereocilia and kinocilia. 
		- when u make any rotation, **like rotating to the left, the endolymph displays and pushes that cupula to the right**
			- pushing the stereocilia to the kinocilia -> depolarization 
		- keep in mind: **kinocilia are towards the midline and stereocilia are out laterally.**
		- if you rotate head to left, you depol the semicircular canal on the left side, but then hyperpolarize on the right side = yolk antagonistic system to help with balance 
		- perpendicular to each other and there's pairs on the same plane:
			there's a L + R pair of horizontal canals - if you depl L, you hyperpolarize the r. this is rotating in space on the horizontal plane.
			R anterior canal and L posterior canal  - altered anguar rotations, which are outside of the horizontal plane activate these. 
			L anterior canal and R posterior canal 
		- if the R anterior canal is depolarized, the R posterior canal is hyperpol 
		- if you activate the canals and maintain a **constant velocity:**
			- vestibular nerve response shows that the fiber gets depolaried, so inc in discharge rate **increases with more acceleration**
			- then the afferent fiber goes to baseline at **constant velocity, meaning the pathway isn't as effective at constant velocity**
			- **deceleration = fiber now hyperpolarized**
			- full stop = back to baseline in the vestibular n . 
	- utricle + saccule , **otolith organs**- responds to **linear acceleration like running or static head position like standing up / laying down**
		- inside the structures = macula will have hair cells. 
			- saccule - macula arranged in a vertical plane, detects displacement up and down, **kinocilia are oriented towards external/lateral portions** , detecting vertical acceleration 
				- think they're on the wall, so they're standing up and activating this .... if posed, then utricles at rest while saccules are working  
			- utricle - on the floor, horizontal movements are sensed... **kinocilia at midline**
				- think if they're snoozing on the floor, if still, then the saccules are at rest 
		- has hair cells that would have cilia be displaced, causing depol or hyperpolarization of the nerves. 
		- receptors = hair cells which have cilia 
		- smaller shorter structure = **sterocilia**
		- longer structure that the stereocelia leans towards: kinocilium
		- depol = stimulation when stereocilia bends **towards the kinocilia**
		- hyperpol = hyperpolarization when **kinocilia bends towards the stereocilia**
		- hair cells will be surrounded by the support cells, which are connected to nerve fibers of the vestibular component of the **vestibulocochlear nerve (CN8)**
			- what aids in depol vs hyperpol = **otoconia = little stones which shift in linear movements, which will then move the hairs**
			- these are on the top, coating the hair. 
- a lot of endolymph fluids filled into the system, and those will help activated structures in the canal by moving the little hairs. 
- membranous labyrinth - membrane lined fluid endolymph 

**effects of force on otolithic MEMBRANE**
- upright = saccules activated, but the otolithic membrane seems to be at rest, sedentary 
- head tilt sustained - 
	- backward tilt = otoconia start shifting backwards, so stereocilia to the kinocilia depolarizing. 
	- forward tilt - otoconia start shifting forward, so kinocilia to the stereocilia hyperpolarizing so you don't fall forward. 
	- start tilt : we see inc in discharge of the nerve response!!! once a constant tilt hit, **we stay activated in the nerve fiber bc u still need to hold that position or it'll fall on his face.**... end tilt we seee that fiber back to baseline. 
	- start tilt backwards - to prevent the help to tilt backwards, given some dip in activity for a constant tilt, then the bactivity comes back. 
- transient - 
	- forward acceleration = initiation of movement, depol.  
	- decceleration = hyperpolarization taking place 


vestibulocochlear n = will be taken from both the otolithic organs and the semicircular canals to enter into the brainstem
- we have vestibular and cochlear component bundled together. 

3 tracts for vestibulospinal 
- lateral and inferior vestibulospinal tract 
	- received input from **utricle + saccul, unilat ipsilateral descending tract.... changes muscle tone in repsonse to gravity** - synaps in lateral vestibular nucleus + sometimes the inferior one. 
	- after synapsing with this, will descend as the lateral vestibular spinal tract after the brainstems dorsal side. 
	- this wil then travel thru ventral columns of spinal cord to aid with postural control 
- medial + superior vestibulospinal tract: 
	- gets input from semicirc canals 
	- synapses in medial vestibular nuclei + superior one. 
	- this will send **bilateral descending tracts and connections t the cervical level to coordination head neck and shoulder**
- vestibuloocular tarct - this is unilateral bc it's checking for linear accleration. you rotat both shouders along this axis 
	- the medial vestibular nuc will send bilareal asceending connections for eye movements.... 
	- CN III, IV, VI via medial longitudinal fasciculus 
	- causes eye movement in response to head rotation - nystagmus - 
the vestibulo-ocular tract + medial superior vestibulo spinal tracts meet at medulla. 

the vestibular cochlear n = **enters the brainstem at the pontine medullary junction, almost directl into the medulla.**
