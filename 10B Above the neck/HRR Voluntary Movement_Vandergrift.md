#sensorimotor 

open vs closed medulla
This distinction is made based on whether the CSF-containing cavities are surrounded by the _medulla_ (_closed medulla_) _or_ not (_open medulla_). 
- closed medulla is caudal to the 4th ventricle 

motor control 
- voluntary , reflexive, unconscious (posture/tone while walking around and all that.)

limbic areas - emotion, behavior, long term memroy 
- amygdala, hippoampus, mammillary bodies etc - this makes like a C shape in the brain! 
- output to the prefrontal campus, cingulate, striatum, nucleus accumbens. 
prefrontal cortex - memories of actions made in the past
- ventromedial = risk processing 
- dorsolateral working memory 

lateral prefrontal cortex = > **behavior strategies , connection to basal ganglia sys + motor cortical areas**
orbitomedial PFC + emotion into motivated behavior, connection to limbic sys + lat PFC 
- any prefrontal lobotomy - unable to anticipate consequences of behavior (impulsive) + perseveration (inability to change behavior)
- delayed response task too 
- schizophrenia 

premotor cortex - is associated, a bit behind prefrontal, in front of the motor strip. = **more complex types of movements**
- fewr betz cells than the primary motor cortex, slight granular layer called layer IV 
- projects locally + distally into thalamus + SC
- reaching. + grasping - diff functions from diff zones 
- if you stimulate the motor strip of near that area you can make ur hands do smth 
supplementary motor area - associated - **more high and stuff**
- medial face of frontal lobe
- somatotopic organization 
- direct projection to spinal cord
- truncal control, temporal sequencing, bimanula tasks, locomiotion ? 
- speech generators too. 

![[functional lobes and cortexes.png]]
**SMA - a bit more medial , mre up towards the midline** 
PMA = more lateral - premotor cortex is more lateral, definitely in front of the primary motor cortex 
strip = primary motor cortex, prefrontal gyrus 

think about intention to move is frontal cortex, 
- decision to move to the supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex, much a lot of reverberation and signalling. 

once the decision is from the frontal cortex, we will shuffle it to the primary motor cortex , the "main act"
- current functional MRI information - 
- seizure - circuits will get reverberated, smuldering movement, seizure can spread from one spot to another - jacksonian march and all that 

primary motor cortex = M1
- 3 long sulci will dead-end to make some motor cortexes and strips. 
- motor cortex comes down into the lateral and sylvian fissures,a nd will be a closed loop gyrus, wrapping around at the bottom . 
- will be **populated with BETZ cells!!!** - 
	- largest neuron 
	- layer V 
	- 10% of Primary cortex output to hte spinal cord
- agranular = lacks the layer IV 
- sulci + gyri individual but preserved
- somatotopical organization - homunculus - 
- when doing functional studies - looking at the hand area
	- M1 neuronal firing precedes the force dev ofc. 
	- spike freq proportional to muscle force 
- inc/dec spiking in the primary motor cortex - and then seen 
	- if we have a flexor spiking to contract
	- you see decrement in the extensor 

the homunculus is the same kinda as the somatosensory's 
- hand knob - sometimes there's a characteristic little posterior bend in the motor strip gyrus (seen in top down view?)

pyramidal tracts - some are 2 nerve system 
- basically BETz cells descending - > pyramidal tracts going down, upside down pyramid shape or a fan shape as the cells signasl descend to the medulla 
- **they descend to synapse on spinal cord at exiting level.**
	- alpha motor neurons - **cell body in the ventral horn of the spinal cord that takes the message out.**
	- interneurons - 
- also descend to synapse on brainstem nuclei 

pyramidal tracts - aren't JUST betz cells!
- 30% are from primary motor cortex
- 30% from SMA and premotor... 
- rest from parietal/cingulate cortex 
![[cingulate gyrus.png]]
as the pyramidal tract descends, turns into all that white matter below the cortex
- posterior limb of internal capsule
- cerebral peduncle of midbrain 
- then ventral pons
- then ventral medulla
- pyamidal decussation - The **decussation of pyramids** is a critical anatomical and functional landmark in the lower medulla, where approximately 90% of [corticospinal fibers](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-anatomy/anatomical-structures/corticospinal-fibers-1553798772) cross from one side of the brainstem to the other
- lateral corticospinal tract LCST in spinal cord 

![[limbic system lateral cut.png]]
limbic system would cradle the internal capsule fibers and stuff, the caudate nucleus would wrap around it like a worm, with the lentiform nucleus at the snake head and the tail being the amygdaloid body 

posterior limb = axial picture might put dorsal on top and ventral on bottom, but all imaging would have dorsal aspects on the bottom and the other way around 
mneumonic 
L for lateral, L for leg, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule 

in the corticospinal tract....
- the crus cerebri = the midbrain cerebral peduncle 
- going from the white matter of posterior limb, going into the ventrolateral aspect of cerebral peduncle , descnding into the pons 
- midbrain cerebral peduncles, Lateral, trunk, and arm/band 
- middle 3rd of cerebral peduncle
	- lateral = legs 

ventral pons 
- next section, internal capsule running on crook of limbic system, then going into the middle 3rd of cerebral peduncle, then going into the pons
- **ventral aspect of bulbous pons**

then into the ventral medullary pyramids, 
	**at this point we go contrallateral** with the 
	- medullary decussation !!!!!  
	- r side of brain would control l side of body basically. 
why is medullary decussation important?
pathology 
if you push your deltoid process down and push it back, it will push into the lower medullar at the top of spinal cord 
- neurologic symptoms 
- lower extremities would cross before the upper extremities 
1. bell's cruciate paralysis - getting just arm weakness without legs
2. wallenber's hemiplegia cruciata - ipsi arm, contra leg pushed backwarsd
	1. crack towards deltoid process
3. cruciate paralysis/??

anterior corticospinal tract - 10% , more upper truncal control, but helps maintain function during spinal cord injury 
- lateral motor systems. - control extremity 
- more medial motor systems - control posture, tone, balance, head/neck orientation, gait ![[motor org of spinal cord.png]]
- see: that the extensors = on one side, extensors on the other. remember leg is lateral too???

spinal intrneurons 
- the corticospinal tracts can synapse on 8 and 7 
- takes info to the muscle: motor neurons 
- intrneurons will intercept that signal and give **negative feedback via the renshaw clls so you on't overdo things**

clostridium tetani. = we get tetanus shots. 
- bsaically bc it it goofs up the renshaw cells 
- if you shut those inhibitory things down, you get tetany all over ur muscles 

corticobulbar tracts - for brainstem motor nuclei
- basically for the facial things,you synapse on the **motor componeent of the brainstem nuclei!!!**
- one thing to commit to memory 
- upper part of face = dual innervation 
- lower part = contralateral innervation only 

upper motor v lower motro neuron 
- proximal to alpha motor neuron = upper motor neuron 
- distal to alpha motor neuron = lower motor neuron
