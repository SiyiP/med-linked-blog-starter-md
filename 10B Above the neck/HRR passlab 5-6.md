- Granule cell layer + Granule cell layer
    
    Granule cell layer (contains many small cells, site of mossy fiber synapses)
    Mossy cells release glutamate which is the major excitatory NT of the CNS
    innermost 
    
- Purkinje cell layer + Purkinje cell layer
    
    Purkinje cell layer (largest cells, dendrites oriented in plane perpendicular to the long -axis of the folium, only cells whose axons leave the cortex)
    inhibitory mainly 
    
- Molecular cell layer + Molecular cell layer
    
    Molecular layer (few cells but many parallel unmyelinated axons)

fastigial nuc - most dense connections to vermis = proximal muscles
- most medial 
interposed nuc = most dense connections to paravermis/intermediate zone distal muscles
- intermed zone 
detnate= mostly to lateral hemisphere, limb muscles, highly skilled movements 
- omst latera 

climbing fiber = originates from neurons of **superior olivary nucleus**

Touch, pressure, vibration, joint receptors, muscle and tendon receptors contribute to proprioception.

The spinocerebellar tracts are used to carry  proprioceptive information to cerebellum. 

DCML carries mechanosensory info to the brain 

ALS carries pain and temperature info to the brain.

thoracic SC levels: Notice the dorsal sulcus is absent. Furthermore, the abundance of white matter to gray matter is greater. Note the presence of the lateromedial horn, which contains sympathetic preganglionic neurons.

the external cuneate nucleus is located dorsolateral to the cuneate nucleus within the medulla. Remember the cuneate nucleus received mechanosensory information from the upper extremities.
The external cuneate nucleus receives proprioceptive information from the ipsilateral upper extremity (arm)

The middle cerebellar peduncle relays information from cortical regions. The superior cerebellar peduncle is output from the cerebellum.

The lateral vestibular nucleus receives information about head position from the utricle and saccule. The cochlea is part of the auditory system which will synapse in the cochlear nucleus.

The lateral hemisphere receives info indirectly from cortical areas, whereas the vermal and paravermal regions are receiving input from the spinal cord and other brainstem regions, via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.

Pontine nuclei will receive motor information from the ipsilateral cortex. Once activated pontine nuclei axons will then cross via the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle for processing in the contralateral lateral hemisphere of the cerebellum.

Remember the corticospinal tract descends through the ventral brainstem as a large fiber bundle. This image is showing the relationship of the structures involved with the corticocerebellar pathway.
- Most of the axons leaving the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncle synapse in the contralateral thalamus for motor error correction.  There is a small proportion that synapse in the red nucleus that play a role in motor learning (ie. baby learning to crawl).

how hyperkinetic movement dz develop
- dmg to subthalamic nuc 
- results in less inhib of thalamus 
- unilateral wild flinging movements of extremities contralateral to lesion
