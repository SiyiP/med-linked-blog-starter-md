lesion at lumbar SC
- ipsilateral loss of mechanosensation and pain + temp from leg
	- dorsal column lesion = mechanosensation 
	- disruption of incoming dorsal root fibers = pain and temp loss 
		- these are 2nd order axons crossing to the contralateral cord @ ventral white commissure then ascend in ALS.... 
		- basically pain and temp enter in by lateral part of dorsal root, synapsing in marginal layer + substantia gelatinosa 
	- touch pressure, proprioception - large myelinated axons entering by medial part of dorsal root and ascending ipsilaterally, some will synapse in nucleus proprius be4 ascending or take part in reflexes

thocacic lesion
- having **contralateral loss of pain and temp below this**
- bc mechanoreceptors will enter dorsal columns + ascend *lateral* to those from the legs (ipsilateral)
- pain and temperature axons synapse in the dorsal horn and 2nd order fibers cross to **contralateral ALS.**
- some mechanoreceptors leave dorsal columns + synapse in clarke nucleus. 2nd order axons proj ipsilaterally via dorsal spinocerebellar tract to the cerebellum 
cervical lesion 
- ipsilatoeral loss of motor correction below 
- mechanoceptors enter into the dorsal columns + ascend lat to ones from legs + trunk ipsilaterally 
- pain + temp - xons  
synapse in  
dorsal horn  
and second  
order fibers  
cross to  
contralateral  
ALS  


medulla lesions - 
- nuclei has cuneat nuc + external cuneat nuc
- ipsilateral loss of mechanosensation and motor correction for the arms and from arms 
- legs **spared bc** mechanosensory fom legs + trunk synapse in gracile nucleus 
- lesion to the spinal trigeminal nucleus (more latera)
	- ipsilateral loss of facial pain + temp 
	- and the jaw motor function 
	- **==think: motor "midline = the motor nucleus" for loss of motor, and sensory "side" for loss of mechanosensation, principle trigeminal nucleus==**
- but a lesion to the primary trigeminal nucleus 
	- ipsilat loss of facial mechanosensation, but 
	- facial sensation spared bc hte principle trigeminal nucleus is lateral to the lesion sight, pain and temp from face descend to medulla to synapse in spinal trigeminla nuc 

midbrain landmarks - cerebral aqueduct, peduncles, red nuleus 
- dmg to this region = ipsilat loss of whole body sensation 

- and contralateral loss of it too 
		due to DCML + ALS 


thalamus - dmg at it = contra loss of sensation neck down since it's both at the L and the A .... at the VPL 

internal capsule 
contralateral **motor loss** to face - lesion to the genu (which has desc motor to face)
anterior limb - Contains axons connecting the cortical and subcortical region
posterior limb - Anterior half of the posterior limb contains descending motor  
axons for the neck and down. The posterior Â½ of the posterior limb contains sensory  
axons

dmg to: 
- als, medial lemniscus, substantia nigra, cerebral peduncles, corticospinal axons
	- -ALS = carry info abt pain + temp from body + face = these are contalateral loss of sensation 
	- medial lemnicuus = touch, pressure, proprioception from body and face. 


dmg to the medullary pyramids = bilateral loss of motor function below the neck. 
- ipsilat loss of motor function below arms = the tectospinal vestibulospinal and rubrospinal area???
- contralateral loss of pain and temp from below arm = als 
CST = corticospinal tract loss = ipsilateral upper motor neuron paralysis to the leg

bilateral postural instability with lesion at the anterior horns. in the middle
