parkinsons
- aging is a huge RF, common after 50, idiopathic. 
- ==some familial cases - alpha-synuclein and protein folding is huge== 
- ==toxins possibly== - pesticides, herbicide, manganese or lead, and opioid drug MPPP or MPTP when recreational. this is like if it's not made correctly 
- ==drug induced parkinsonians - usually reversible like **DA receptor antags like antipsychotics and antiemetics can cause this**==
- enhancement of cholinergic function can cause this too like anticholinesterase drugs when treating glaucoma 
- ==**bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, postural instability, reduced voice vol, drooling, loss of sense of smell + cognitive decline!!!! as it advances**==
- without treatment rigid akinetic state 5-10 years
- ==basically loss of SN pars compacta - loss of that all + getting lewy bodies!!==
- ==![[lewy bodies.png]]== - clusters of the alpha-synuclein proteins and all that. 
- note: **parkinsons = low dopamine, and psychosis at high dopamine!!!!! Major SE of these drugs can be psychosis!**
==![[antiparkinsons drugs.png]]==
dopaminergic pathways
1. substantia nigra dopamine are meant to go into the 
	1. nigrastriatal pathway for movement. 
	2. ==mesocortical== pathway - higher order function like reward, motivtation. dysfunction here/when it's too high = schizophrenia, psychoses 
	3. ==mesolimbic== - reward, dysfunction or when it's ==too high causes addiction, schizophrenia, psychosis== 
	4. ==periphery is another path of this dopamine, **vasodilation caused by too much D1 so hypotension,** , kinda loss of balance with walking in the orthstatic patients.== 
	5. ==chemoreceptor trigger zone - N/V in excess of dopamine== 

balance bt the excitatory cholinergic neurons + inhibitory dopaminergic neurons D2.
- ==GABA - open the Cl conductance, hyperpol cell which inhbitis the movement==
- ==GABA is ***ACH*-controlled like with the striatum, which would STIMULATE GABA release!!!**==
- ==dopamine - would inhibit the GABA release== 
- for normal controlled movement, have a balance and ACH to impact GABA 
- ==**loss of dopamine in parkinsons, = excess in ACH signalling, which increases GABA, making it harder to activate things**==
	- ==inhibition of movement happens with this== 

strategies to inc dopamine or decrease ACH in brain 
==note that **dopamine doesn't cross BBB well so we use L-dopa**==
tyr -> L-dopa -> dopamine 
- ==in parkinson's disease we lose **tyrosine hydroxylase...** so we can't just administer tyrosine==
- so thats why we give L-dopa right after it which will get converted. 

degradation of dopamine 
- occurs by COMT and MAO-B which works only on dopamine unliek MAO-A which breaks down NE, epi, serotonin and stuff. 

==levodopa = L-dopa = dopamine precursor  - used in combo therapy , usually to inhibit the conversion of it in the periphery so more can get to the brain== 
if we give L-dopa orally, only some gets into bloodstream, then ==only some will be **crossing the BB via L-amino acid transporter**==
- ==but the ones in ur periphery can be made into dopamine, which would cause AEs like vasodilation, N/v==
- ==or get degraded by COMT== 
- ==once the dopamine is made, MAO-b and COMT can be in the brain to degrade it, might wanna combine this== 
- **this is a prodrug - most effective but issue in hit and miss**
	- ==if you give dose of drugs, you might get end-of-dose effects, symptoms return at end of dosing interval, or an on-off phenomenon with them **fluctuating rapidly in later stages while being off for just a bit.**==
	- ==**over time we see decline in responsiveness ): BC the cells that make the L-dopa to dopamine will Eventually die off. **==
- ==SEs; n/v,postural hypotension due to peripheral action of dopamine, and a bit more mild comparitively but: hallucinations, psychosis, confusion, impulse control== 
- only a small amt of it reaches brain 
- levodopa-carbidopa - so that not make too much dopamine in the periphery  
- levodopa-carbidopa-entacepone 

==peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors = -== 
- ==carbidopa== - will ==stop the peripheral dopa decarboxylases, which will convert things to dopamine causing AEs like N/v and hypotension vasodilation==. 
	- ==more circulating l-dopa can now reach the brain, plasma half life increases==
	- used in combo with l-dopa, SEs: ==making mental impact of L-dopa - hallucinations, psychosis, confusion, impulse control  higher bc more's getting to brain== 

==catechol-o-methyl transferase COMT inhbitors, -capone=== 
==inhibition of DOPA-decarboxylase leads to **compensatory activation of L-dopa metabolism by comt.... so 3-O-methyl dopa would compete with L-dopa for active transport across the BBB and the intestines.**== 
==this is all helpful for response fluctuation patients who have taken L-dopa== 
- entacapone - periphery, don't cross BBB 
- tolcapone  - across the BBB? but still works in the periphery 
	- ==note - this is **hepatotoxic!!!!!**==
- stop the L-dopa into being 3-MT or in the case off just tolcapone, 3MT (meaning 3-o-mehtyl dopa)
- ==both AEs: n/confusion, hallucinations, also diarrhea, abdominal pain, orthostatic hypotension== 

==monoamine oxidase B MAO-b inhibitors - stop the conversion of dopamine in the brain into DOPAC, -giline== 
2 types of MAO in the CNS with MAO-b helping metabolize dopamine - ==**we have to give these low doses because higher doses would deactivate MAO-A which makes u get hypertension and all that stuff.**==
- both these allow u to **decrease our good l-dopa dose bc we can enhance and prolong these effects by making it last longer**
- ==selegiline - MAO-B at **low concentrations, metabolized to amphetamine and methamphetamine....**==
	- ==AEs: amphetamines anxiety and insomnia== 
	- ==AEs of L-dopa increased... must reduce dose==
	- ==can cause **serotonin syndrome - stupor, rigidity, agitation, hyperthermia, delirium, death when administered with narcotics and analgesics**==
- rasagiline  - more potent 
- don't have to memorize the diff between the two 

==dopamine receptor agonists - these CAN cross the BBB. bind rlly well but we can have more SEs ): bc hit a lot of CNS stuff .. start low enough doses maybe and **use these when all ur cells die**.== 
- **lower incidence of response fluctuations, drugs all selective for D2 receptor but have highest affinities for D3 receptors... but these are more psychiaric reactions**
- ==pramipexole==
- ==ropinirole==
- ==apomorphine== - these are more severe side effects ; peripheral SEs too (super severe n/v). 
	- ==this can be a **rescue drug for off episodes of akinesia!!!** esp when we get the off effect in the highs and lows of L-dopa== 
- ==**first line for mild PD, delaying the usage of L-dopa**==
- AES
	- dyskinesia - lower risk than L-dopa, but basically hyper movements too much signalling uncontrolled movements
	- n/v 
	- postural hypotension 
	- psych issues 


---

==anticholinergics are used - there's a balance bt ACH and dopamine usually , used shortterm== 
- ==both will block muscarinic receptors on **striatal cells!**== 
- used for ==early PD , maybe in combo with L-dopa but also for pts who can't tolerate L-dopa== 
1. ==benztropine==
2. ==trihexyphenidyl== 
- anticholinergic effects all there: ==**constipation, dry as a cracker, crazy as a rabbit (delirium) , hard to let go of any fluids... tachycardia, blind as a badger**==
- ==**can inc the amount of cognitive decline bc we need ACH for memory function ):**  - don't put any pt already having mental decline on this== 
- limited beneficial effects = course of dz not altered 

anti-viral/dopamine agonist - not clear on MOA, helps short term 
- ==amantadine  - when given against influenza a==
- weak antiparkinsonium properties, short lived benefits, less SEs 

when to begin therapy - 
- **effect of disease on dominant hand, how much can they put up with interfering with their quality of life and everyday activities??**
- presence of bradykinesia or gait disturbance
- their values/preferences
- note the severity of symptoms and their age. 
	- ==all the drugs that are for short term like the amantadine or anticholinergics etc would be for younger patients==
	- ==don't start L-dopa for younger patients bc it will wear off over time...== 
- ==on a standard patient, start with the MAO-B inhibitors first, then the anticholinergics, amantadines, then the dopamine agonitts with more progression. then L-dopa preparation too==
