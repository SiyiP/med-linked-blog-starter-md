last 6 biochem dz stateS!!!

==no TAGs in the NS - these are all just beta ox breakdown for energy. recall - brain can't use them for energy, so they don't use fatty acids but rely on glucose.== 
- ==when we have starvation,  brain use ketone bodies that are made from livr.== 


==glycerophosphoipids - we have phosphate+alcohol and 2 FAs== 
- ==these are PC, PS, PE, PI all membrane components==
==sphingolipids - has fatty acid, phospho, and choline.== 
- note - ==with a choline, this makes a sphingomyelin. - **expressed highly in our system**==
sphingosine = glycolipid type... basically FA + mono/oligosaccharide! 
- cerebrosides, globoside, sulfatide, ganglioside  
- ==sphingosine backbone = from **palmitoyl COa + serine!!!**==
	- ==sphingosine has reactive hydroxyl and amino group at polar end which an react with diff groups to make more complex ones.== 
	- ==serine = is that active end== 
	- ==palmitoyl coa = the hydrocarbon tail.== 
	- ==makes **ceramide by reacting the fatty acid group. ceramide is totally a base for all these other ones, too**==
		- and ceramide can make all these other cool phospholipids, 
		- if you add phosphoryl choline group to ceramide: = PC = similar to sphingomyelin , has overlapping functions.
	- ==ceramide + one glucose/galactose = cerebrosides  **only one monosac attached.**==
	- ==ceramide + 2 or more sugars = globoside== 
	- ==ceramide + galactose + sulfate = sulfatide==
	- ceramide + more than 2 sugars + ==**sialic acid (modded monosaccharide and a carboxyl group with a negative charge, aka NANA)** = ganglioside - in ganglia cells== 
		- GM2 = mono sialic gangliaside, like one sialic acid residues. 
		- GD1 = two; di 
		- GT1 = three...tri, numbers don't tell u anything abt the count in the structures 
various phsophooacylglycerols - PS, PC, PE, PI 
- all glycerol + 2 FAs + phsophate + some alcohol group. 
- ==cardiolipin = diphosphatidyl glycerol - 2 PAs together, by a third glycerol!!! very large lipid, in the **inner mt membrane, huge in ox phos bc of this in the ETC**==

==white matter = **higher lipid concentration , low proteins**==
==gray matter = low lipids, high proteins==
some lipids enriched in CNS than other tissues
- ==**cholesterol really high in brain** more than other tissues in our body== 
- but no cholesterol esters! 
- ==enrichment in galactosylceramide, sphingomyelin + sulfatides = **in white matter than gray matter**; myelin enriched has more white matter.== 
	- ==**galactose** enriched sphingolipids - in the myelin sheaths help interact with the axons.== 
	- myelin disorders
	1. hypomyelination - ==failure to form during dev==
	2. demyelination - breakdown of normal myelin after formation 
		1. ==primary== - caused by ==direct dmg to myelin sheath or myelin forming cells==
		2. ==secondary== - happens ==this will be **following degen of axons*** - axons and myelin are mutually dependent.== 
		3. ==acquired autoimmune + infectious dz = **multiple sclerosis**==
		4. ==genetic dz = leukodystrophies, refsum's dz (can't break down branched chain FA, accumulations of these in cells), phenylketonuria==
		5. toxic + nutritional dz = ==lead poisoning== 
			1. nutritional: ==vitamin B12== likely would be huge; neurological symptoms are huge , dx by ==**increased anti-intrinsic factor antibodies detected, can't absorb b12 due to the parietal cells, like in autoimmune atrophic gastritis**==
				1. ==single methyl donor reactions in the white matter cause this==
				2. ==don't have that SAM being made in the body, so catecholamines + making of the sheaths are not there.== 
			2. ==and B9 deficiency iff there's no neurological symptoms== 
		6. dz primarily affecting neurons with ==secondary involvement of myelin: mechanical trauma, infarction, tumors, **lysosomal storage dz**==
			1. our ==neurons are mainly affected by lysosomal storage bc they're meant to be longterm cells with longterm dmg and are dependent on natural turnover of any dmg'd structures==
			2. ==primary lysosomal HYDROLASE defect = biggest thing that's huge for the lysosome storage dz== - recall that these are meant to break down and clear sphingolipids. most common. 
			3. ==acid alpha glucosidase defect = **pompe's dz**==; turning glycogen to glucose 
			4. ==alpha - L - iduronidase **hurler's**==
			5. ==idursulfase **hunters dz**==
	-  **loss of lipids = more water = detected in MRI!!!!**
	- ==. sometimes cholesterol esters are MADE by phagocytic cells which are called to clear that debris, since there's no cholsterol esters normally!, so cholesterol esters are a disease sign==
		- ==**acyl coa cholesterol acyl transferase ACAT, makes a very hydrophobic cholesterol esters,,, indicator of recent dmg*==
- and ==PC/PE/PS/PI phosphoacylglycerols **higher in gray matter.**==

2 major types of lysosomal storage dz 
- ==mucopolysaccharidoses - accumulation GAGs== 
- ==sphingolipidoses - main focal point - accumulation of sphingolipids== 
accumulation of lipids can cause traffic jams and nothing can get in or out or gen toxic things

list of storage dz!!! for **defects in sphingolipid metabolism**

![[lysosomal storage diseases.png]]

1. ==fabry dz = alpha-galactosidase A , will accumulate ceramide trihexoside = **only one that's x linked here, all else is AR**==
	1. 2 gal and 1 glucose to a ceramide = ceramide trihexoside.... ==supposed to make lactosylcerebroside.== 
	2. ==basically will lead to **full bod / localized pain, peripheral neuropath**y, **angiokeratoma**, hypohidrosis - **nerve detachment from sweat glands, kidney failure, cardiomyopathy**==
	3. ==**see kidney failures, 16 years expectancy in males, kidney cells are most impacted**==
2. ==gaucher dz - glucocrebrosidase defect, makes glucocerebroside accumulation== 
	1. lactosylcerebroside -> **glucocerebroside**, which u have to try taking that Glc off to make ceramide again 
	2. ==3 forms: non-neuronopathic type 1 , acute infantile neuropathic type 2 , and chronic neuronopathic type 3== 
	3. ==**hepatosplenomegaly, *bone* pain, osteoporosis, anemia + neuro symptoms**==
	4. these are ==common, enzyme replacement thrapy, appearance of this **macrophages that look like crumpled tissue paper.** due to glucose accumulation== this is due to glucose accumulation in the macrophages 
	5. ==type 2 = end up in die by age 2== 
3. ==niemann-pick dz - sphingomyelinase - makes accumulate sphingomyelin== 
	1. 2 forms - ==type a classic infantile (die in 2 years) and type b visceral== 
	2. ==**cherry red spot on retina , foam cells, hepatosplenomegaly** and ofc neurodegen. - cherry due to the accumulation of sphingomylin, and the foam cells are due to the **lipid laden environment!!!** -> foam cells make hepatosplenomegaly accumulation== 
	3. the ppl with type A would die in the first 2 years 
4. ==tay-sachs - hexosaminidase A - accumulate GM2 ganglioside==
	1. ==supposed to be broken down from GM2 to GM3.... supposed to remove GALNAC== 
	2. 3 forms = infantile, juvenile, adult/late onset 
	3. ==**onion skin appearance in lysosomes!**==
	4. ==cherry red spot on retina, **developmental delays, and psychomotor stuff - NO HEPATOMEGALY!** - no foam cellls !==
	5. kids with infantile form die in 2-3 years and then go blind first 
5. ==krabbe dz - beta-galactocerebrosidase, accumulates galactocerebroside== 
	1. first, ==sulfatide gets broken into galactocerebroside.== 
	2. ==but can't make into ceramide from there, can't remove galactose.== 
	3. ==buildup of galactocerebroside==
	4. accumulation of galactocerebroside -> ==makes **psychosine, neurotoxin!!!**==
	5. *progression will cause ==degen of motor skills, 3-6 months after birth with fever, sizures, muscle weakness, vision loss + slowing development==*
	6. ==**low white cells**==
	7. ==***globoid* cells = occur in brain tissue a cell with a whiter rim around it**==
6. ==metachromatic leukodystrophy - arylsulfatase - accumulates cerebroside sulfate== 
	1. remove sulfate off the sulfatide, making galactocerebroside is normal 
	2. ==we can't take sulfate off sulfatide, so can't make galactocerebroside so can only make and accumulate cerebroside sulfate.== 
	3. ==central + peripheral demylinatenation==
	4. *late infantile, juvenile, adults*
	5. ==symptoms happen after 1st year of life.==
