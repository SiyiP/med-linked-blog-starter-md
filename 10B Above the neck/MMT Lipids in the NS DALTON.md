last 6 biochem dz stateS!!!

no TAGs in the NS - these are all just beta ox breakdown for energy. recall - brain can't use them for energy, so they don't use fatty acids but rely on glucose. 
- when we have starvation,  brain use ketone bodies that are made from livr. 


glycerophosphoipids - we have phosphate+alcohol and 2 FAs 
- these are PC, PS, PE, PI all membrane components
sphingolipids - has fatty acid, phospho, and choline. 
- note - with a choline, this makes a sphingomyelin. - **expressed highly in our system**
sphingosine = glycolipid type... basically FA + mono/oligosaccharide! 
- cerebrosides, globoside, sulfatide, ganglioside
- sphingosine backbone = from **palmitoyl COa + serine!!!**
	- sphingosine has reactive hydroxyl and amino group at polar end which an react with diff groups to make more complex ones. 
	- serine = is that active end 
	- palmitoyl coa = the hydrocarbon tail. 
	- makes **ceramide by reacting the fatty acid group. ceramide is totally a base for all these other ones, too**
		- and ceramide can make all these other cool phospholipids, 
		- if you add phosphoryl choline group to ceramide: = PC = similar to sphingomyelin , has overlapping functions.
	- ceramide + one glucose/galactose = cerebrosides  **only one monosac attached.**
	- ceramide + 2 or more sugars = globoside 
	- ceramide + galactose + sulfate = sulfatide
	- ceramide + 2+ sugars + ==**sialic acid (modded monosaccharide and a carboxyl group with a negative charge, aka NANA)** = ganglioside - in ganglia cells== GM2 = mono sialic gangliaside, like one sialic acid residues. GD1 = two, GT1 = three... numbers don't tell u anything abt the count in the structures 
various phsophooacylglycerols - PS, PC, PE, PI 
- all glycerol + 2 FAs + phsophate + some alcohol group. 
- cardiolipin = diphosphatidyl glycerol - 2 PAs together, by a third glycerol!!! very large lipid, in the **inner mt membrane, huge in ox phos bc of this in the ETC**

white matter = **hihger lipid cncentratin , low proteins**
gray matter = low lipids, high proteins
some lipids enriched in CNS than other tissues
- **cholesterol really high in brai**n than other tissues in our body 
- but no cholesterol esters! 
- enrichment i galactosylceramide, sphingomyelin + sulfatides = **in white matter than gray matter**; myelin enriched white matter. 
	- galactose enriched shpingolipids - in the myelin sheaths help interact with the axons. 
	- myelin disorders
	1. hypomyelination - failure to form duirng dev
	2. demyelination - breakdown of normal myelin after formation 
		1. primary - caused by direct dmg to myelin sheath or myelin forming cells
		2. secondary - happens ***following degen of axons*** - axons and myelin are mutually dependent. 
		3. acquired autoimmune + infectious dz = **multiple sclerosis**
		4. genetic dz = leukodystrophies, refsum's dz (can't break down brached chain FA, accumulations of these in cells), phenylketonuria
		5. toxic + nutritional dz = lead poisoning 
			1. nutritional: vitamin B12 likely would be huge ; neurological symptoms are huge , dx by **inc anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, can't absorb b12 in the **
			2. and B9 if there's no neurological symptoms 
		6. dz primarily affecting neurons with secondary involvment of myelin: mechanical trauma, infarc, tumors, lysosomal storage dz
		7. 
- and PC/PE/PS/PI phosphoacylglycerols **higher in gray matter.**
