-Superior cerebellar peduncle - primarily output toward forebrain  
-Middle cerebellar peduncle - input from **pons**
- cerebrocerebellar pathway ; on the level of the PONS 
-Inferior cerebellar peduncle - input from brainstem and spinal cord

midbrain = has the red nuclei in the middle, big circular stuff
- has a circular opening as the aqueduct 
- the bumps at the top as the colliculi 
- middle third 
- **recall: CEREBRAL PEDUNCLE**
	- corticobulbar + corticospinals -> travel in the middle 
	- on the 1/3 on SIDES, the cerebrospinal will travel thru 

periaqueductal gray. = **gets info from the ALS, and then will send out signals to "shut off" that pain**

•Primary inputs to cerebellum –Inferior olivary nucleus –Somatic and muscle receptors (spinocerebellar tracts) •Proprioceptive information –Dorsal nucleus of Clarke –Lateral cuneate nucleus –Mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal –Vestibular receptors –Descending motor command information •Primarily from the cerebral peduncle

recall for the tbl - molecular cell layer of cerebellum is on the top, most outer. 
granule cell layer on the bottom. - very very mossy , small cells 
- purkinje = inhibitory GABA, largest + perpendicular to folia, axons will leave that cerebellar cortex 
- mossy granular cells. - glutamate, excitatory 
external cuneate nucleus - just lateral to the internal normal one... this is gonna be like accessory getting proprioceptive input from C1-4 ipsilaterally 

"one stop shop of all the 10B content"
refer back to this and overlay pathways!!!
understand: name these, and then modalities of information and trajectory (crossing points)
in person review -> office hours for last min questions

DCML - dorsal column medial lemniscal pathway 
- mechanosensory 
![[dorsal column pathway levels.png]]
when u lesion, you'd impact everything below or above it? 
- any sypapsing below the medulla would impact mechanosensation on the ipsilateral side. 
1. the lower limbs -> dorsal roots -> SC dorsal side 
2. then fibers will ascend on the ipsilateral side, all the way to medulla
3. in the medulla, we synapse in the gracile nucleus (more medial)
4. ==when activated gracile nucleus of medulla sends to **contralateral side**==
5. ascend thru the **medial lemniscus** on the other side -> medulla, pons, midbrain 
	1. in the open medulla: 
	2. legs most ventral, arms most dorsal. like a sitting upright man 
	3. ==at the midbrain, ALS is dorsolateral to DCML==
	4. closer to medial center in the rostral medulla 
6. then into the VPL - **ventroposteriorlateral** nucleus in the **thalamus**
7. thalamus relays -> medial side of the somatosensory postcentral gyrus.
- 
1. upper limbs -> dorsal roots -> SC dorsal side of **cervical level**
2. then fibers will ascend on the DC ipsilateral side, all the way to medulla, laterally 
3. in the medulla, we synapse in the cuneate nucleus 
4. ==cuneate nucleus of medulla sends to **contralateral side==
5. ascend thru the **medial lemniscus** on the other side -> medulla, pons, midbrain 
6. then into the VPL - **ventroposteriorlateral** nucleus in the **thalamus**
7. thalamus relays -> more **lateralish** side of the somatosensory postcentral gyrus.

facial: 
1. trigeminal nerve relayed in mechanosensation-> trigeminal ganglion lateral to pons -> enter via pons
	- ==synapse in the principle primary nuc of trigeminal nerve **in the pons!**-> **cross at that level**==
- join and ascend thru the medial lemniscus then the thalamus
- ==in the thalamus activate on the VPM!!!! and then will get sent to -> most lateral somatosensory cortex==

ALS - pain+temp changes pathway in the body - anterolateral system 
![[ALS pathway levels.png]]
1. from the lower body, -> Dorsal root ganglion -> synapses on **dorsal horn sensory cells**
2. ==dorsal horn sensory cells send fibers which **cross to contralateral side, ascending thru lateral column of white matter**==
3. going thru the lateral ALS thru the SC, medulla, pons, midbrain, all the way to the thalamus
	1. in the medulla - the legs are lateral and face medial 
4. goes into the **VPL** of the thalamus **bc it's from the body**
5. then to the medial side of the somatosensory cortex 
-  
1. at cervical level, Dorsal root ganglion -> synapses on **dorsal horn sensory cells**
2. ==dorsal horn sensory cells send fibers which **cross to contralateral side, ascending thru lateral column of white matter**==
3. going thru the contralateral lateral ALS thru the SC, medulla, pons, midbrain, all the way to the thalamus
4. goes into the **VPL** of the thalamus bc it's from the body  
5. then to the lateral side of the somatosensory cortex 

pain pathway of face!!!
![[pain pathway of face.jpeg|277x466]]
1. pain from face comes thru the **trigeminal n** -> trigeminal root ganglion -> **pons!**
2. fiber goes **down** via the **spinal trigeminal tract**, going to the ==**spinal== trigeminal nucleus at the medulla**, bc of that elongation from embryonic times. 
3. ==they sent signals that **cross at level of medulla, to then ascend**==
4. ascend thru the ***trigeminothalamic* tract**
5. thalamus VPM , info coming from the face so VPM relays to **most lateral aspect of the cortex.**

motor control 
upper motor neurons - descending systems - motor cortices/brainstem centers 
- motor cortex, <- basal ganglia feed in for proper initiation via the premotor areas etc. 
- brainstem centers <- sensory motor coodrination of ongoing movement
local circuit neurons - **lower motor neuron integration with synapses from the upper motor neurons -> lower motor neurons = these are all spinal cord and brainstem circuits**, these actually help you move the skeletal muscles 
- sensory inputs also feed into local circuit neurons 
![[motor org of spinal cord.png]]
- keep gray matter org in mind - 
- more media aspects of ventral horn = more midline muscles
- more lateral aspects of ventral horn = distal muscles , **more fine type motor controls, think of fingers + toes**

corticospinal and corticobulbular tracts
![[corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts.png]]
1. precentral gyrus, recall the 6 diff layers of neurons, having **cell bodies of upper motor neurons**
2. send signals down via white matter region = **posterior limb of the internal capsule**
3. fibers continue to descend thru the **midbrain** via the **middle third of the cerebral  peduncle**
	1. in the cerebral peduncles, ==axons for face most medial, leg more lateral==
4. fibers get bundled into the **pontine fiber bundle of the middle pons**
5. run down tot he medulla, **thru the medullary pyramids** bc pyramidal cells will send them thru 
6. ==when they get to **caudal medulla, they cROSS thru the decussation to the contralateral side**==
	1. 10% stay on the same side, they will **travel down the ventral column on the same side,**
	2. then the ==**anterior corticospinal tract** will **send BILATERAL projections to both sides in the more MEDIAL aspect of ventral horn** for postural control!!!!==
	3.  ==anterior corticospinal tract for the axial muscles, descending down the anterior column in the fold that the tectospinal tract might be in too==
	4. more medial aspect of ventral horn controls POSTURE/gross truncal muscles, sneding out gross bilateral projections
7. post-crossing, on the contralateral side, they go thru the **lateral corticospinal tract -> ==continues to descend thru the lateral column**==
8. ==cells innervate the **lateral** cells of the ventral horn== 
9. lateral corticospinal tract cells will control the **fine motor control, more distal msucles**
10. they will exit out the ventral roots 


==The trigeminal motor nucleus of CN V is found just medial to the principal sensory nucleus of CN V.==

corticobulbar - tract
1. precentral gyrus, recall the 6 diff layers of neurons, having **cell bodies of upper motor neurons**
2. send signals down via white matter region = **posterior limb of the internal capsule**
3. fibers continue to descend thru the **midbrain** via the **middle third of the cerebral  peduncle**
4. at the pons area... we start to have fibers peel offf to innervate CN nuclei in the Head, neck, shoulders, etc.

vestibulospinal tracts - we have 2: lateral and medial! gets sensory info to ilicit motor response 
1. origin: vestibular system's semicircular canal and the utricles(horizontal plane change detection)+saccules(vertical plane change detection). 

lateral. - 
- utricle and saccule, so changes muscles due to response to gravity 
- utricles procc'd while running
1. utricles send signals via vestibulocochlear nerve CN 8 and then synapse in the **lateral vestibular nuclei**
2. lateral vestibular nuclei sends **ipsilateral UNILATERAL projections down the VENTRAL column** - ==this will be a little bit SC goes down ventrolaterally== 
3. ventral column helps out with posture control + balance. 
==**vestibular nuclei projects to cerebellum via inferior cerebellar peduncles**==

medial - more from semicircular canals - **we have an vestibulaocular pathway (ends in ocular motor nuclei) and also a vestibulospinal pathway (ends in the cervical spine)**  
- **causes movement of head + shoulders to coordinate eye + head movements**
2. semicirrcular canal information all this information comes in via the CN8, vestibulocochlear nerve -> 
3. synapse in the **medial vestibular nuclei** 
4. medial vestibular nuclei sends **bilateral projections descending...**
	1. this new tract is called the **medial vestibulospinal tract!**!!!
	2. ==descend in folded ventral column of ventral horn, similar place as tectospinal tract.==
	3. this coordinates head neck shoulder movement so it'll end at a cervical level! 
	4. note about the vestibulospinal tract - extensors would predominate 
5.  medial vestibular nuclei sends **bilateral projections ascending...
	1. these fibers are **medial longitudinal fasciculus!!! MLF = ascending**
		1. these are **just ventral + medial to the periaqueductal gray!!**
		2. see this most clear in the isthmus 
	2. these will coordinate eye movements nystagmus 
==**vestibular nuclei projects to cerebellum via inferior cerebellar peduncles**==

cerebellum pathways summary slides - 3 main pathways; a lesion on the cerebellum itself would impact: the ipsilateral side 
cerebrocerebellum/corticocerebellum 
![[lesion of the dentate nucleus.png|278x216]]
1. from the cortex
2. sending signals thru the internal capsules
3. thru the middle cerebellar peduncle 
4. down to the ipsilateral pons -> **activation of the pontine nuclei**
5. ==**pontine nuclei cross to the contralateral side** to the lateral hemisphere of cerebellum via the **middle cerebellar peduncle**==
6. lateral hemisphere of cerebellum  = **dentate nucleus** = ==most dense connections to limb msucles + highly skilled movements==
	1. if **corrections needed, sending out via superior cerebellar peduncle to**
	2. **contralateral thalamus's AND RED NUC if we have to LEARN** 
	3. thalamus sends back to origin 
	4. and then after the **correction...** motor cortex will send the corrected info down thru the **internal capsule, midbrain, pons, medulla**
	5. 90% of fibers would cross at medulla into the contralateral side for motor function. 
part 2: learning: 
	6. motor cortex finds out it has to learn after signals from dentate nucleus hits... so 
	7. signals into that **red nucleus, ipsilaterally of the cortex/on the other side of that dentate nucleus, facilitation of flexors AND motor learning**
		1. red nucleus would also innervate the flexors in the rubrospinal tract, where flexors of upper limb would predominate. 
		2. rubrospinal track ==descends thru lateral column, slightlly ventral of corticospinal==
		3. Axons of red nucleus neurons descend and cross j ventral to their exit from red nucleus 
	8. red nucleus sends signals into the inferior olivary nucleus on its side, 
	9. inf olivary nucleus sends info to the **CONTRALATERAL dentate nucleus/lateral hemisphere via the INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE.**
	10. dentate sends from the info to the **red nucleus back there contralaterally via the Superior cerebellar peduncle!!*
	11. once we get smooth behavior, we **eventually have the Dentate nucleus/lateral hemiphere send info CONTRALATERALLy to the thalamus**
	12. and the thalamus sends to premotor + motor cortex on that same side. 
	13. motor cortex sends motor instructions to the other side as usually 

spinocerebellar tract - unconscious proprioception of body 
![[fastigial nuc lesion.png]]
1. proprioceptive info from leg go into dorsal root ganglion 
2. dorsal root ganglion go into the **thoracic level of cord ascending into clarkes nucleus**
	1. ==note: in the UPPER extremities we'd instead synapse in the **external cuneate nucleus in the medulla, which is diff from the regular cuneate nucleus** ...== 
		1. this is more lateral 
		2. ==will be sending it thru the **inferior cerebellar peduncle**==
	2. this has the same effect sending that info thru thru ipsilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle into the fastigial / interposed nucleus
3. clarke's nucleus takes that information and **sends it up the spinal cord thru the LATERAL column**
4. and then at the medulla - the fibers **enter into cerebellum via INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE**
5. this information would travel via that into the **vermal paravermal region of this**
6. info will synapse in **interposed/fastigial nucleus** - sends that error corrected information OUT of the cerebellum 
	1. fastigial nuc = most dense connections to vermis/**proximal** muscles
	2. interposed nuc = more dense connections to intermediate zone/**distal** muscles 
7. this corrected information goes from the superior cerebellar peduncle to **contralateral thalamus**
8. contralateral thalaus sends information to the cortex which sends it out on the other side.. the error corrected version will be sent back into the **contralateral side where the signal was originally from** to correct into the dorsal root ganglion 

---
vestibulocerebellum 
- vestibular nuc sends in info thru the **ipsilateral cerebellar peduncle thru the flocculonodular lobe, which will then send the information, back out thru the cerebellar peduncle into the inferior vestibular nuclei**
1. activation of vestibular organ inside the ear like semicircular canals with spinning 
2. go thru the **CN VIII, which is vestibuloocular nerve**
3. goes into the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei 
4. moves info from the ipsilateral side using **inferior cerebellar peduncle into the FN or flocculonodular lobe**
5. FN lobe will error correct by **sending it back out on the ipsilateral side using inferior cerebellar peduncle into vestibular nuclei**
6. vestibular nuceili would send **descending signals down same side to regulate body positions and ascending signals into the eye movements**

basal ganglia - direct + indirect pahtways
direct = go pathway D1, disinhibition of the thalamus 
indirect. = D2R ... modulation and what ends up happening
- **thru dopamine binding to D2, caudate/putamen will stop releasing anything into the globus pallidus external segment**
- the  globus pallidus external segment will regularly **tonically fire GABA** into the subthalamic nucleus
- this will inhibit the STN... 
- STN cannot excite that globus pallicus internal segment!!!
- therefore not much is going into the VA/VL complex of thalamus to activate it at all. 

![[tectospinal and reticulospinal tract.png]]
- tectospinal tract = will descend from superior colliculus of midbrain, ==ends at cervical level==
- cross immediately 
- ==descends in SC at the **most ventral aspect, tucked in the fold of the ventral horn!!!**==

reticulospinal tract = locomotion, posture control 
- from pontine reticular formation 
- and medullary reticular formation 
- both go down unilaterally 
- medial intermediate zone and ==most front part of SC==

![[descending white matter spinal cord.png]]

symptoms from this one lesion??
1. sacral spinal cord - **loss of bilateral parasympatehtic outflow to** urinary bladder results in no bladder emptying reflex, atonic bladder
2. spino-medullary junction  - pyramidal decussation destroyed = bilateral upper motor paralysis from neck down with spasticity
3. closed medulla  - destroy gracile nucleus results in ipsilateral loss of touch, pressure,  
proprioception from leg and trunk
4. caudal open medulla 
5. medulla pons junction 
6. caudal pons
7. brainstem 
8. brainstem + forebrain lvls 
9. rostral midbrain

tbl cases
case 1 
- 9th thoracic vertebra 
- severe dmg to spinal cord
- UMN paralysis of L Leg , no more touch/pres/joint sense/proprioception on L leg
	- descending tracts = UMN dmg! 
	- dmg to ipsilateral lateral corticospinal tract of SC 
- cutaneous hyperesthesia - around abdominal wall on l side at level of umbilicus 
	- what causes those **BANDS? the dorsal roots are damaged, so we have an isolated band of loss of pain + temp on inpsilateral to contralateral.**
	- brown's seclard syndrome ???
- R side - total **analgesia, thrermoanesthesia of skin of abdominal wall below umbilicus + R leg**
	- means there's a dmg to the contralateral ALS ! 
dorsal L column
he has a L sided spinal lesion, in his entire L side of his cord !!! 

with a T9 vertebral dislocation, the spinal cord lvel dmg'd will be T10... all the way thru T12 ... **bc it still has to descend BEFORE it exits!!!**
recall - C1-7 exit above corresponding vert, C8 below C7 
further and further down, spinal n exits progresively lower as you descend hence why T12 was the answer. 
LMNs = alpha moto neurons that sends it to the low muscles

remember how to diff UMN and LMN lesion!!!
![[upper motor neuron v lower motor neuron issues.png|481x185]]

case 2 
- inc muscle tone bilaterally lower extremities
- prog weakness
- reducted strengt in hand, wrist bilaterally 
- severe foot muscles
- started in extremities + gradually inc 
- continuous fasciculations
- atrophy in L hand and wrist muscles bilatrally 
- babinski sign bresent
- needs assistance to walk 
ALS / lou gehrigs 

motor pathways are impacted here 
presents with both UMN and LMN dmg - 
- LMN: fasciculations, atrophy, muscle weakness (a symptoms of both)
- UMN - inc muscle tone, poz babinskis, muscle weakness 

what is the most likely location of dmg??
- recall - this is impacting the **lower motor neurons!**
- ==bilateral dmg to ventral horns  = where the gray matter ventral horns is !!!! = where the lower motor neuron bodies are== 
- recall there's also no loss of sensation so no lateral or dorsal dmg

what dmg is accounting for the UMN signs?? 
- ==secondary degeneration of CST axons is causing UMN signs = coming from the loss of the LMN, ventral alpha motor neurons in the ventral horn== 

---
case 3 
- 17 yo recovered from a COLD
- weak legs and then progressive weakness in arms 
- weakness to uppr + lower part of face, 
- severely weak of all limbs 
- no stretch reflexes, mod reductin of vibration sensation distally, legs more than arms. 
- when peripheral nerves stimulated electrically, amplitude nrmal but SLOW conduction velocity 
- CSF protein high 
- on ventilator for 3 days then strength back 
guillain barre?? 

likely dmg'd =- peripheral nerves 
demyelination 
large myelinated axons damaged predominantly!!! 

---
case 4 
- broad based and unsteady , gait + stance is broad
- stomping on ground 
- lying supine + attempting to move = jerky and clumssy, 
- movement inaccurate with eyes closed but accurate and hard for eyes open 
- no atrophy, tone normal 
- proprioception + touch + vibratory absent in toes + ankles + reduced in knees = plurality - basically spinal cord region = **bilateral dorsal columns**
- pinprick + temp sensation mildly dec in the feet 
- tendon reflexes absent  in legs
- **plantar responses are flexor.**
proprioception absent + somatosensation not there much 
temp and pain dec in foot mildly ? 

unsteadiness - based on dmg from loss of touch, pressure, vibration + prprioception 

postural/truncal ataxia - lesion of caudal vermis primarily impacts medial motor systems, 
- usually poorly corrected by the vision 
- **why is unsteadiness worse in dark? he's using vision to cmpensate for lack of proprioception and loss of touch**
note: **bilateral dorsal column DEGEN: due to B12 DEFICIENCY with monocytic anemia or TABES DORSALIS - untreated syphilis**
==pain and temp **mild reduction bc that degeneration would progress into that dorsal horn, acusing a loss more and more of the sensation in pain and temperature!**==


**cerebellar lesion patient would have trouble doing finger to nose with EYES OPEN**
