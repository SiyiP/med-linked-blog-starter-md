DCML - dorsal column medial lemniscal pathway 
- mechanosensory 
![[dorsal column pathway levels.png]]
when u lesion, you'd impact everything below or above it? 
- any sypapsing below the medulla would impact mechanosensation on the ipsilateral side. 
1. the lower limbs -> dorsal roots -> SC dorsal side 
2. then fibers will ascend on the ipsilateral side, all the way to medulla
3. in the medulla, we synapse in the gracile nucleus (more medial)
4. ==when activated gracile nucleus of medulla sends to **contralateral side**==
5. ascend thru the **medial lemniscus** on the other side -> medulla, pons, midbrain 
	1. in the open medulla: 
	2. legs most ventral, arms most dorsal. like a sitting upright man 
	3. ==at the midbrain, ALS is dorsolateral to DCML==
6. then into the VPL - **ventroposteriorlateral** nucleus in the **thalamus**
7. thalamus relays -> medial side of the somatosensory postcentral gyrus.
- 
1. upper limbs -> dorsal roots -> SC dorsal side of **cervical level**
2. then fibers will ascend on the DC ipsilateral side, all the way to medulla, laterally 
3. in the medulla, we synapse in the cuneate nucleus 
4. ==cuneate nucleus of medulla sends to **contralateral side==
5. ascend thru the **medial lemniscus** on the other side -> medulla, pons, midbrain 
6. then into the VPL - **ventroposteriorlateral** nucleus in the **thalamus**
7. thalamus relays -> more **lateralish** side of the somatosensory postcentral gyrus.
- 
1. trigeminal nerve relayed in mechanosensation-> trigeminal ganglion lateral to pons -> enter via pons
	- ==synapse in the principle primary nuc of trigeminal nerve **in the pons!**-> **cross at that level**==
- join and ascend thru the medial lemniscus then the thalamus
- ==in the thalamus activate on the VPM!!!! and then will get sent to -> most lateral somatosensory cortex==

ALS - pain+temp changes pathway in the body - anterolateral system 
![[ALS pathway levels.png]]
1. from the lower body, -> Dorsal root ganglion -> synapses on **dorsal horn sensory cells**
2. ==dorsal horn sensory cells send fibers which **cross to contralateral side, ascending thru lateral column of white matter**==
3. going thru the lateral ALS thru the SC, medulla, pons, midbrain, all the way to the thalamus
	1. in the medulla - the legs are lateral and face medial 
4. goes into the **VPL** of the thalamus **bc it's from the legs**
5. then to the medial side of the somatosensory cortex 
-  
1. at cervical level, Dorsal root ganglion -> synapses on **dorsal horn sensory cells**
2. ==dorsal horn sensory cells send fibers which **cross to contralateral side, ascending thru lateral column of white matter**==
3. going thru the contralateral lateral ALS thru the SC, medulla, pons, midbrain, all the way to the thalamus
4. goes into the **VPL** of the thalamus 
5. then to the lateral side of the somatosensory cortex 

pain pathway of face!!!
![[pain pathway of face.jpeg|277x466]]
1. pain from face comes thru the **trigeminal n** -> trigeminal root ganglion -> **pons!**
2. fiber goes **down** via the **spinal trigeminal tract**, going to the **spinal trigeminal nucleus at the medulla**, bc of that elongation from embryonic times. 
3. ==they sent signals that **cross at level of medulla, to then ascend**==
4. ascend thru the **trigeminothalamic tract**
5. thalamus VPM , info coming from the face so VPM relays to **most lateral aspect of the cortex.**

motor control 
upper motor neurons - descending systems - motor cortices/brainstem centers 
- motor cortex, <- basal ganglia feed in for proper initiation via the premotor areas etc. 
- brainstem centers <- sensory motor coodrination of ongoing movement
local circuit neurons - **lower motor neuron integration with synapses from the upper motor neurons -> lower motor neurons = these are all spinal cord and brainstem circuits**, these actually help you move the skeletal muscles 
- sensory inputs also feed into local circuit neurons 
![[motor org of spinal cord.png]]
- keep gray matter org in mind - 
- more media aspects of ventral horn = more midline muscles
- more lateral aspects of ventral horn = distal muscles , **more fine type motor controls, think of fingers + toes**

corticospinal and corticobulbular tracts
![[corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts.png]]
1. precentral gyrus, recall the 6 diff layers of neurons, having **cell bodies of upper motor neurons**
2. send signals down via white matter region = **posterior limb of the internal capsule**
3. fibers continue to descend thru the **midbrain** via the **middle third of the cerebral  peduncle**
	1. in the cerebral peduncles, ==axons for face most medial, leg more lateral==
4. fibers get bundled into the **pontine fiber bundle of the middle pons**
5. run down tot he medulla, **thru the medullary pyramids** bc pyramidal cells will send them thru 
6. ==when they get to **caudal medulla, they cROSS thru the decussation to the contralateral side**==
	1. 10% stay on the same side, they will **travel down the ventral column on the same side,**
	2. then the anterior corticospinal tract will **send BILATERAL projections to both sides in the more MEDIAL aspect of ventral horn**
	3. more medial aspect of ventral horn controls POSTURE/gross truncal muscles, sneding out gross bilateral projections
7. post-crossing, on the contralateral sid, they go thru the **lateral corticospinal tract -> continues to descend thru the lateral column**
8. cells innervate the **lateral** cells of the ventral horn 
9. lateral corticospinal tract cells will control the **fine motor control, more distal msucles**

The trigeminal motor nucleus of CN V is found just medial to the principal sensory nucleus of CN V.

corticobulbar - tract
1. precentral gyrus, recall the 6 diff layers of neurons, having **cell bodies of upper motor neurons**
2. send signals down via white matter region = **posterior limb of the internal capsule**
3. fibers continue to descend thru the **midbrain** via the **middle third of the cerebral  peduncle**
4. at the pons area... we start to have fibers peel offf to innervate CN nuclei in the Head, neck, shoulders, etc.

vestibulospinal tracts - we have 2: lateral and medial! gets sensory info to ilicit motor response 
1. origin: vestibular system's semicircular canal and the utricles(horizontal plane change detection)+saccules(vertical plane change detection). 

lateral. - 
- utricle and saccule, so changes muscles due to response to gravity 
- utricles procc'd while running
1. utricles send signals via vestibulocochlear nerve CN 8 and then synapse in the **lateral vestibular nuclei**
2. lateral vestibular nuclei sends **ipsilateral UNILATERAL projections down the VENTRAL column**
3. ventral column helps out with posture control + balance. 

medial - more from semicircular canals - **we have an vestibulaocular pathway (ends in ocular motor nuclei) and also a vestibulospinal pathway (ends in the cervical spine)**  
- **causes movement of head + shoulders to coordinate eye + head movements**
2. semicirrcular canal information all this information comes in via the CN8, vestibulocochlear nerve -> 
3. synapse in the **medial vestibular nuclei** 
4. medial vestibular nuclei sends **bilateral projections descending...**
	1. this new tract is called the **medial vestibulospinal tract!**!!!
	2. this coordinates head neck shoulder movement so it'll end at a cervical level! 
	3. note about the vestibulospinal tract - extensors would predominate 
5.  medial vestibular nuclei sends **bilateral projections ascending...
	1. these fibers are **medial longitudinal fasciculus!!! MLF = ascending**
		1. these are **just ventral + medial to the periaqueductal gray!!**
		2. see this most clear in the isthmus 
	2. these will coordinate eye movements nystagmus

cerebellum pathways summary slides - 3 main pathways; a lesion on the cerebellum itself would impact: the ipsilateral side 
cerebrocerebellum/corticocerebellum 
![[lesion of the dentate nucleus.png|278x216]]
1. from the cortex
2. sending signals thru the internal capsules
3. thru the middle cerebellar peduncle 
4. down to the ipsilateral pons -> **activation of the pontine nuclei**
5. **pontine nuclei cross to the contralateral side** to the lateral hemisphere of cerebellum via the **middle cerebellar peduncle**
6. lateral hemisphere of cerebellum  = **dentate nucleus**
	1. if **corrections needed, sending out via superior cerebellar peduncle to**
	2. **contralateral thalamus's AND RED NUC if we have to LEARN** 
	3. thalamus sends back to origin 
	4. and then after the **correction...** motor cortex will send the corrected info down thru the **internal capsule, midbrain, pons, medulla**
	5. 90% of fibers would cross at medulla into the contralateral side for motor function. 
part 2: learning: 
	6. motor cortex finds out it has to learn after signals from dentate nucleus hits... so 
	7. signals into that **red nucleus, ipsilaterally of the cortex/on the other side of that dentate nucleus, facilitation of flexors AND motor learning**
		1. red nucleus would also innervate the flexors in the rubrospinal tract, where flexors of upper limb would predominate. 
		2. Axons of red nucleus neurons descend and cross j ventral to their exit from red nucleus 
	8. red nucleus sends signals into the inferior olivary nucleus on its side, 
	9. inf olivary nucleus sends info to the **CONTRALATERAL dentate nucleus/lateral hemisphere via the INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE.**
	10. dentate sends from the info to the **red nucleus back there contralaterally via the Superior cerebellar peduncle!!*
	11. once we get smooth behavior, we **eventually have the Dentate nucleus/lateral hemiphere send info CONTRALATERALLy to the thalamus**
	12. and the thalamus sends to premotor + motor cortex on that same side. 
	13. motor cortex sends motor instructions to the other side as usually 

spinocerebellar tract - unconscious proprioception of body 
![[fastigial nuc lesion.png]]
1. proprioceptive info from leg go into dorsal root ganglion 
2. dorsal root ganglion go into the **thoracic level of cord ascending into clarkes nucleus**
	1. note: in the UPPER extremities we'd instead synapse in the **external cuneate nucleus in the medulla, which is diff from the regular cuneate nucleus** ... 
	2. this has the same effect sending that info thru thru ipsilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle into the fastigial / interposed nucleus
3. clarke's nucleus takes that information and **sends it up the spinal cord thru the LATERAL column**
4. and then at the medulla - the fibers **enter into cerebellum via INFERIOR CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE**
5. this information would travel via that into the **vermal paravermal region of this**
6. info will synapse in **interposed/fastigial nucleus** - sends that error corrected information OUT of the cerebellum 
7. this corrected information goes from the superior cerebellar peduncle to **contralateral thalamus**
8. contralateral thalaus sends information to the cortex which sends it out on the other side.. the error corrected version will be sent back into the **contralateral side where the signal was originally from** to correct into the dorsal root ganglion 

---
vestibulocerebellum 
- vestibular nuc sends in info thru the **ipsilateral cerebellar peduncle thru the flocculonodular lobe, which will then send the information, back out thru the cerebellar peduncle into the inferior vestibular nuclei**
1. activation of vestibular organ inside the ear like semicircular canals with spinning 
2. go thru the **CN VIII, which is vestibuloocular nerve**
3. goes into the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei 
4. moves info from the ipsilateral side using **inferior cerebellar peduncle into the FN or flocculonodular lobe**
5. FN lobe will error correct by **sending it back out on the ipsilateral side using inferior cerebellar peduncle into vestibular nuclei**
6. vestibular nuceili would send **descending signals down same side to regulate body positions and ascending signals into the eye movements**

basal ganglia - direct + indirect pahtways
direct = go pathway D1, disinhibition of the thalamus 
indirect. = D2R ... modulation and what ends up happening
- **thru dopamine binding to D2, caudate/putamen will stop releasing anything into the globus pallidus external segment**
- the  globus pallidus external segment will regularly **tonically fire GABA** into the subthalamic nucleus
- this will inhibit the STN... 
- STN cannot excite that globus pallicus internal segment!!!
- therefore not much is going into the VA/VL complex of thalamus to activate it at all.

symptoms from this one lesion??
1. sacral spinal cord - **loss of bilateral parasympatehtic outflow to** urinary bladder results in no bladder emptying reflex, atonic bladder
2. spino-medullary junction  - pyramidal decussation destroyed = bilateral upper motor paralysis from neck down with spasticity
3. closed medulla  - destroy gracile nucleus results in ipsilateral loss of touch, pressure,  
proprioception from leg and trunk
4. caudal open medulla 
5. medulla pons junction 
6. caudal pons
7. brainstem 
8. brainstem + forebrain lvls 
9. rostral midbrain
