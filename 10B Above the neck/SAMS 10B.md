Acute injury of the skin would be associated with nociceptive. Nociceptive pain is type of pain caused by damage to body tissue. Somatic pain can be constant and comes from superficial injury.
  
The medullary reticulospinal axons descend bilaterally via the lateral reticulospinal tract to inhibit extensor muscle tone and the pontine reticulospinal axons descend ipsilaterally through the medial reticulospinal tract to facilitate extensor tone.
 After upper motor neuron lesions, facilitation of extensors dominates, thus leading to spastic paralysis.  A lesion to the right cortex takes away the ipsi pontine reticulospinal and the bilateral medullary reticulospinal, thus leaving the left pontine reticulospinal intact (since it receives cortical input from the left), resulting in contralateral extensor hypertonia and spasticity.  

1. Medial Reticulospinal Tract (Pontine): Descends ipsilaterally in the anterior funiculus, Responsible for controlling axial and extensor motor neurons e.g enable extension of the legs to maintain postural support ; Stimulation of the midbrain locomotor centre can result patterned movements (e.g. stepping)
2. Lateral Reticulospinal tracts (Medullary): Descends bilaterally in the lateral funiculus. Responsible for **flexor motor neurons**; Inhibits the medial reticulospinal tract and therefore extensor motor neurones enabling modulation of the stretch reflex

   There would be contralateral paralysis due to the loss of corticospinal input to the lower motor neurons, but the spasticity is related to the changes in the reticulospinal input.

| It is important to remember that the **major output from the cerebellar cortex is via Purkinje cells** releasing GABA on the deep cerebellar nuclei.  The **major output from the cerebellum is via the deep cerebellar nuclei** to target cortical and brainstem regions for corrective behaviors. | Fastigial nucleus gets the major inhibitory output from the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum |

==|The anterior lobe of the cerebellum tends to be damaged initially by chronic alcoholism==.  If you recall the somatotopic organization of the spinocerebellum, the l**ower half of the body is mapped to the anterior lobe region of the spinocerebellum**, thus ==causing the patient to have a drunken gait, even when sober.==  Eventually as the disease continues other regions of the cerebellum will be affected.|   |

  
The SCP is the major output bundle from the cerebellum.  These fibers exist the cerebellum thru the SCP cross to then innervate the contralateral thalamus.  A portion of these fibers will cross to innervate the contralateral red nucleus. sending to the red nucleus, superior colliculus, and thalamus.

The ICP receives **ipsilateral sensory information from the spinal cord and the vestibular nucle**i.  The **ICP is also how the cerebellum communicates back to the vestibular nuclei ipsilaterally.**
- lesion here would reduce spinal cord proprioceptive input to the cerebellum

The **MCP is the major input fiber bundle to the cerebellum**.  These fibers **originate in the contralateral pontine nuclei, and receive information from cortical regions.**


The ==**displacement** of the **cupula**== in the SCC ==semicircular canals== the hair cells that **relay signals through CNVIII to the medial vestibular nucle**i, which then activates the ==medial vestibulospinal tract to coordinate head, neck, shoulder movement==s.

| The **medial vestibulospinal tract** originates from the **medial vestibular nucleus** and projects bilaterally to cervical spinal cord levels. It plays a key role in **reflexive head and neck positioning** during movement and helps  stabilize gaze and posture. |     |

|Remember that the ALS pathway crosses to the contralateral side of the cord to ascend close to or at the level of sensory input into the spinal cord.  The reason the young man couldn't feel left side pain/temp below T12 is because all the pain fibers from below that level cross to the right side at time of entry, therefore they are damaged. 
All the pain/temp sensations are intact on the left side bc those fibers will cross above the lesion.   <br><br>The pathway for **fine tactile discrimination is the Dorsal Column, medial Lemniscus.**  Because the patient reports normal sensation of this modality, one can assume the dorsal/posterior side of the cord is intact. <br><br>As for the motor impact, you will learn soon that motor signals from the **motor cortex will descend ipsilateral and then cross to the contralateral side at the level of the medulla.**  So the left motor cortex controls the right side of the body, and vice versa.  Once those fibers cross at the medulla, they will continue to descend to synapse on the motor neurons in the ventral horn of the contralateral side.  In this case, the right ventral horn.  **Encroachment of a lesion into the right ventral horn will impact motor function on the right side.|**   |

why pain projects to the cingulate gyrus: 
The activation of the a==nterior cingulate gyrus is part of the **affective-motivational pathway of pain**==, in which pain information is relayed to various limbic structures for emotional responses.

==The autonomic response to pain is through activation of **brainstem reticular formation,** which **regulates visceral motor responses.**==

1. gracilis - the touch, pressure vibration from legs
2. cuneat - touch, pressure vibration from arms 
3. the medial lemniscus -  At this level the dorsal column fibers are ascending on the same side to synapse in their corresponding nuclei THEN cross through the medial lemniscus (3) to the contralateral side
	1. if this part is lesinoed, pain and temp stays the same. but the entire touch/pressure is fuceked
4.  the ALS pathway ascends and stays out lateral at the level of the medulla. The medial lemniscus (3) is also marked in this cross section but this fiber bundle is **local** and **only contains fibers that are crossing to the opposite side.** whereas the ALS (4) is a long-distance vertical bundle.
	1. if this part is lesioned, everything on ur body contralaterally is fucked pain/tempwise but touch vib and pressure is the same 

DCML pathway:
Mechanoreceptors--DRG--Dorsal Column (ipsilateral)--cuneate/gracile nucleus (ipsi)--cross thru medial lemniscus---project to **contralateral VP thalamus**--SS cortex

ALS pathway:
Thermoreceptors/nociceptors--DRG--dorsal horn sensory neurons--project to **contralateral ALS pathway to ascend to VP thalamus**--SS cortex

So the right thalamus/SS cortex corresponds to the sensory information from the left side of the body.
- ==loss of pain and temperature AND touch/vibration on the left side|==
