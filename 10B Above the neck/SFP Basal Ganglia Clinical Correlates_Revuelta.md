overview movement disorders

hypokinetic
1. parkingsons dz. 
	1. 55-60 mean age onset inc risk with age, but 5-10% onset undrer 40 
	2. inc risk: male, age, **pesticides, head trauma**, maybe genetcic? idk 
	3. ==**dec risk - gout, caffeine, nicotine, NSAIDs** huh== 
	4. ==bsaically - SN pars compacta - will play a role bt stiratum and stuff...== 
		1. GPE firing rate = less in the parkinsons patient. so the indirect pathway would be on 
		2. parkinson's **disinhibited STN more active, and GPI more active.**
		3. SN would always try to facilitate the direct pathway. 
	5. ==SN lost, lewy bodies usually, and **caudal to rostral spread happens!**== 
	6. cardinal motor features = bradykinesia is necessary like **finger taps get smaller an slower**, rigidity, tremor **at rest** 4-6 hz, postural instability might happen *later*.
		1. gait/posturewise, we will see not swinging arms and short steps 
	7. tremor - seen at rest and at distractions and re-emerges with tremor. 
	8. TREAT: neuroprotection is experimental ): restorative is experimental. 
		1. Symptom management dopaminergic 
		2. Deep brain stimulation - basically getting the 
			1. address the GPI - putting. a probe there and or upstream at the STN to calm them down in signals. 
		3. note - there's a good amt of nonmotor issues happening too! 
2. atypical parkinsonian syndromes;; PSP and CBD **both tau**, DLB + MSA both alpha-syn/lewy 
	1. PSP - ==progressive supranuclear palsy,== many **cognitive frontal lobe issues, not so much tremor but a lot of axial rigidity, ==facial dystonia look of astonishment + eyes can't look up and down**==
		1. ==pseudobulbar speech== 
		2. supranuclear palsy 
		3. ==**tau + neurofibrillary tangles**==
		4. ==fronto-temporal dementia== 
		5. ==hummingbird sign==  - brainstem atrophy 
	2. ==CBD corticobasal degen - severely **asymmetric** parkinsonism== 
		1. ==motor - dystonia, apraxia, **alien limb**, myoclonus; can't use the hands.== 
		2. cognitive - aphasia dementia ; ==**cognitive issues happen early, tipping u off of this**==
		3. black CSF hugely lot of trophy 
		4. dystonia -> FTD, spectrum 
		5. ==**tau. + balloon neurons**== 
	3. DLB - dementia lewy bodies
		1. dementia **early, psychiatric presentation**; precedes motor symptoms 
		2. hallucinations. + psychosis + paranoia 
		3. basically neuroleptic sensitivity 
		4. diurnal fluctuations in alertness
		5. spectrum?? PDD -> DLBD. parkinsons can cause this eventually .... vs diffuse lewy body disease. 
		6. in the middle what pathology is mixed? 
	4. ==multiple system atrophy MSA - both ***autonomic* and synuclein + glial cytoplasmic inclusions**==
		1. parkinsnoian type 
		2. Cerebellar type (less in this type o country)
	- atypical ones don't respond to treatments and are more aggro + poorly responsive ): 
3. secondary parkinsonism - vascular, drug induce

hyperkinetic
1. huntington's dz 
	1. CAG repeats.... 36-39 = repeats = intermediate range. 
	2. **greater than 40 repeats = abnormal 100% penetraition for the diesease!!!!**
	3. social worker needs to be there
	4. jerky movements, moving a lot. 
	5. tpe f walking - frontal lobe walking 
	6. autosomal dom, HTT gene on chromosome 4 = huntingtin = confers toxic gain of function 
	7. what causes cell death = accumulation of hungtintin ?? 
	8. chorea treat with tetrabenazine VMAT inhibition, dopamine receptor blockade, DBS
	9. psychiatric help - dopamine receptor block for psychosis. + monitor 
		1. some **antisense oligonucleotides ASO to try to reduce transcription of HTT mutation is promising**
2. dystonia - **involuntary sustained muscle contractions making twisting + squeezing movements + abnormal postures... they are stereotyped repetitive movements varying in speed resulting in fixed posture**
	1. ==BG = imbalance bt direct + indirect, so GPI is quiet, dec inhibition== 
	2. cortex - lose inhib + sensorimotor 
	3. ==commonly **focal, mostly impacting jaw, cervical in shoulder tild/elevation, spasmodic dysphoria with abdomen, arms, etc**==
	4. ==there's primary dystonia== 
		1. ==primary pure dystonia, DYT 1,6== 
		2. secondary dystonia is due to neurometabolic dz and neurodegen disorders.... 
			1. due to stroke lesions and tumors , toxins liek anoxia and **drugs**, atypical parkinsonian symptoms and infection 
	5. TREAT: ABCDs 
		1. ==Artane = anticholinergic== 
		2. ==baclofen, botox (focal dystonia original cause)==
		3. ==clonazepam== 
		4. ==dbs to the **globus pallidus pars interna!**==
3. essential tremor
	1. unchecked oscillations thru cerebellar thalamo cortico pathwyas??
	2. seems to run in family no genes tho 
	3. will target a lesion in the thalamus, ventral intermediate one will be in the root in the thoracic tract 
	4. ==**torpedo cells in the cerebellum1!!!**== - due to purkinje cell misshappening.... 
	5. dx - **action** and postural, postrual kinetic. 
	6. no known 2ndary cause, neuro signs, but does run in families 
	7. action tremor stops u from doing sooo much 
	8. first line 
		1. ==primidone== 
		2. ==propranolol== 
	9. 2nd line: topiramate, benzodiazepenes
	10. ==DBS of the **ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus was so helpful??**==
