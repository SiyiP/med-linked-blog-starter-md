fyi slides dont count for testing 
focus on non-pharm and non opoiid therapy first line 
- aways multimodal with many diff types 
- opioid therapy only if benefits utweigh risks + initial treatment would always be a therapeutic trial with effective lowest dose 
- long term oopioid = begins with treatment of acute pain ): 

3 basic categories
- nociceptive = **inflammation, injuruy, mechanical stress which would influence nociceptors**
	- somatic  = most common, tissue inflammation or dmg is SEEN on imging or eyes 
		- achy, dull, deep gnawing, sharp stabbing + well localized 
		- your **parietal pleura can be somatic pain, sharp and localized!!!**
	- visceral = seen in imaging, BV and internal organs
		- dull achy gnawing, **colicky, cramping, squeezing, pressure, bloating, n/v pallor diaphoresis** long term 
		- poorly localized, diffuse pain. 
		- can be blockage, swelling, cancers, injuries inside the body, inflammation  
		- **quite often referred radiation of MI to jaw/arm for insteance.**
		- ![[referred pain.png]]
- neuropathic pain 
	- injury + inflamamtion of NERVES 
	- typcally follows **nerve pathway or dermtome**
	- we can get very hypersensitive 
	- ***burning***, ***lancing electric***, numb, radiating, shooting stabbing tingling heat hypersensitivity 
	- radicular - in n roots (zoster sciatica) or stocking glove neuropathy stuff... like diabetic 
- acute pain - pain response to tissue injury or inflammation - 
	- good pain is warning is protective, allowing it to fully heal. 
	- somatic and visceral pain 
- chronic pain - 3+ month , more than 12 wks 
	- no purpose, lacks acute warning function, result of injury or ongoing dz (rheum) 
- nociplastic pain = most challenging ; part of chronic pain 
	- **this is what chronic pain turns into**; starts as somatic, visceral and or neuropathic pain 
	- dysfunction - altered processing of this pain signals in brain + SC, not actually tissue dmg of nerve injury 
	- **central sensitization** = nervous system hypersensitive , amplifying pain signals and decreasing its own inhibitory rrsponses - not a specific one. 
		- "nervous system has a sunburn"
	- **plasticity changes = growth of abnormally functionaing neurons, permenant change**
	- featurs of somatic, visceral and neuropathic
	- vague hard to describe symptoms - widespread + poorly localized
		- fibromyalgia + IBS
	- **key dx - H+P** 

chronic pain = 24.3% of population with 8.5 high impact chronic pain = happens to more ppl who are marginalized and older too 
costs - common reason for med care. 

most common causes
- back pain 
- headache
- arthritis 
- other MSK 
chronic pain person impact 
- limits mobility + daily activities -> anxiety and depression ; self fulfilling prophecy 
- dependence on opioids, NOT addiction 
- physical functioning 
	- mobility 
	- impaired immunity 
	- sleep disturbances
	- fatigues 
	- loss appetite 
- societal consequences - disability , substance abuse. 

biopsychosocial model of pain 
psychosocial socioeconomic
- spiritual physical 
social functining 
- diminished relationsips etc sexual function + intimacy + decreased recreational and social activities 

physical consequences of chronic pain 
- decreases = immune sys + gut motility 
- inc = HR, peripheral vascular resistance , bp, cardiac oxygen consumption , work of breathing 

pain assessment - ofc 
- OLDCARTSETC
- severity can be the very important for what rx you chose and route - 
- pain # to function - what ipmact does that number have on the function 
phys exam 
- based CC + inspection, palpation, percussion 
- think about neurologic, ROM and strength test 

pain management 
- relieve pain and other symptoms - 
- maintain or improv function, minimize disability 
- enhance QOL 
- enhance functional independence 
- with the lowest number of SE, cultivate well being

realistic goal/expectations - no pain is not real 

physical help 
- patient centered self administrated. PT, OT, referral helps so much 
- ice + heat
- tai chi - **highlighted over and over in our data helps with strengthening + stretiching**

psychological/behavioral. 
- meditations , acceptance and commitment therapy 
- mindfulness 
- CBT 
- biofeedback, coping strategies art therapy, musc, pet therapy 

procedural
- meds, steroids
- **require invasive - nerve block, trigger point injections, and intrathecal pump targetting area with some materia**
- apparently acupuncture too is decent 
- radiofrequency ablation as a last resort 

non-opioids
- topicals - **diclofenac gel NSAID**
- acetaminophen
- anticonvulsants
- antidepressants 

opioids
- oral short acting 4-6 hrs
- oral long acting 12 hrs
- IV up to 2 hrs
- transdermal 3-7 days 
- consider with severe pain + SEs that might get exasterbated. 
- significant QOL impact, and potentially make sure they're opioid responsive. 
- is there any documented benefit actually on this??
- establish good pain management and regimen for talking. 

acute pain 
- exercis, ice/heat, strengthen, stretch, yoga, motion is lotion. 

procedural
- for the most part, these aren't rlly given unless it's acute on chronic
- nerve block, steroid injections, trigger point injections 

non-opioid pharm treatment 
- topicals 
- NSAIDs
- acetaminophen 
acute pain opioids
- outpaitent usually oral short acting
- and inpaitent either short acting or IV

we can use non-opioid things but we ca also use 
- **anticonvulsants and antidepressants for chronic pain - may take a while to get these.**
- a lot of those are based on impact and how well it can actually work - dependent on full effect and taking weeks 
- many SSRIs ... anx/depression make sure u actually treat it 
- sleep is a huge thing to help someone with pain 
use non-opioids bc as opposed to the other bc  
- hepatic dz and renal dz not much of an issue
- less sedation
- less resp depression + SEs

u can use chronic pain opioids - 
- but along with all that make sure u still use the non-opioids, we need to use with multiple modalities
