penetrance - proportion of genotypes that show expected genome
expressivity - individual expression of certain genome - some redheads have super red hair vs strawberry blonde
mosaicism - diff populations of cell in organism 
- germline - mutations- mom and dad
- somatic - after birth, issues , cells dispersed in areas 

1. friedreichs ataxia
	- AR, FXN gene in chromosoe 9 
	- frataxin gene, iron storage in the ETC/mt
	- iron depots happen in the mitochondria, cerebellum, spinal cords , dorsal root ganglia, heart, purkinje cells like in cerebellum
		- spinal cord thinner, dentate nuc of cerebellum bad, peripheral nerves highly impacted
	- gait + limb ataxia **with heart issues, scoliosis, diabetes,**, happens in late childhood + early teen years 
	- loss of lower extremity reflexes 
	- EMG/NCS , MRI, EKG, echo. genetic testing 
	- compare with charcot marie tooth 1+2 
	- TREAT: omaveloxolone - combo activation o Nrf2 and NF-kb helps with ATP production in mt and iron transport stuff 
2. charcot-marie-tooth
	1. most commonly inherited, AD mostly, groups of other types 
	2. result in **peripheral neuropathy by affecting myelin sheath or axons itself**
	3. we see champagne glass legs - lower extremity weakness, foot drop, arched feet, hammertoes, hand symptoms later on 
	4. variable penetrance, no change in life expectancy ; they maintain mobility 
	5. TREAT: PT 
	6. DX: EMG/NCS slows, and **onion bulb neuropathy!!!!!** and nerve biopsy on sural nerve(which is good bc it's primarily a sensory issue) + genetic testing 

3. neurocutaneous syndromes / phakomatoses
	- birthmark - phako 
	- ectoderm - brain , skin and eyes !!
	1. neurofibromatosis 1 - AD but half spontaneous
		- germline mutation 
		- **von recklinghausen's disease = in chromosome 17** 
		- various , it's a spectrum 
		- neurofibromas everywhere 
		- cafe au lait spots - birthmark on back of arms 
		- lisch nodules- little islands in the retinas!! the irises!!
		- optic pathway glioma- see a huge optic nerve tumor!
		- epilepsy 
		- vascular pathology like aneurysms , renal artery stenosis 
		- TREAT: cut out stuff we need to cut out, and test for cancer regularly ... esp painful ones too ): and treat optic pathway gliomas with chemo bc can't cut out 
			- sometimes need SHUNT -  if there's a **tumor in the choroid plexus, we make too much CSF** so u get buildup and extrafluid in the brain hydrocephalus ... this is to reduce the amount of this and take the pressure out 
			- hole in skull and then push tube into ventricles and then putting it into the belly to get it into resorbed into the omentum 
	2. neurofibromatosis 2 
		- MISME dz ! "Multiple Intracranial Schwannomas/neurofibromas Meningiomas Ependymomas(spinal cord)" - this is a mneumonic ! 
		- AD , on **chromosome 22, coding for tumor suppressor protein merlin**
		- intracranial - we see big tumor on the CN 8, schwannoma ... **bilateral vestibular schwannomas**
		- meningiomas come off the edge, the dura of the skull 
		- ependymoma in the 4th ventricle  - lumps in the spinal cord 
		- TREAT: cut out what we need to cut out. just treat and remove symptomatic or rapidly growing thins 
	3. Tuberous sclerosis - AD, mutation in TSC1 and or TSC2 gene affecting mtOR pathway
		- sebaceous adenomas on fact - looks like freckles but more solid 
		- tumors in the CNS - cortical tubers disorganized tangled up neural cells in **subcortical area, grayish spots**
		- subependymal giant cell astrocytomas - tumors = SEGA - at the foramen monro/interventricular foramen , right at the bottom is the fornix 
		- kidney tumors tooo - renal cell carcinomas
		- congnitive dysfunction + seizures/epilepsy 
		- lymphangioleimyomatosis - lung destruction + pneumothorax 
		- skin - facial angiomyolipomas + shagreen patches??
		- TREAT: cutting tubers aka cortical tubors out epilepsy and sometimes SEGAS aka the subependymal giant cell astrocytomas can make hydrocephalus too when blocking the foramen monro
	4. sturge-weber
		- somatic mutation! not inherited!!!
		- mosaic pattern, of GNAQ - torturous vessels on one side of brain 
		- characteristic - **port wine stain trigeminal distribution**
		- ocular issues - glaucoma, choroidal hemangiomas
		- leptomeningeal angiomas - peel of the brain not done well - **tram track sign on the imaging for this**
		- seizures from brain involvement 
		- TREAT: control with emobolization ones to help with vascular issues + control seizures with medication 
	5. von hippel lindau
		- chormosome 3, 3 words. VHL tumor suppressor gene mutation 
		- AD , 20% spontaneous
		- main thing: **hemangioblastomas in CNS + eye** - blood vessel tumor, wild strawberry - fine lumps all the way around, lots of blood flow to it - abnormal connections can hemorrhage or get **cysts**.
		- renal cell carcinoma is huge!!!
		- pancreatic tumors
		- endolymphatic sac tumors
		- TREAT: all these little white dots/hemangioblastomas - u have to watch and continue w/ imaging, there's too many. besides that, treat all cancers. **posterior fossa emergencies - acute hydrocephalus**
	6. ataxia telangiectasia (widened BV on the skin)  - **louis bar syndrome**
		- AR, chromosome 11, ATM gene
		- oculocutaneous telangiectasias, a lot of these are in the nose too! in eyes too 
		- can sometimes present as recurrent nose bleeds
		- **ataxia from cerebellar purkinje loss!! withering or atrophy of the cerebellum leaf in imaging**
		- high risk for malignancy, like if u get radiation bc it's a **dna repair deficiency!**, even a CT scan is sooo bad. use mri or ultrasound 
		- **thymus atrophy = immunocompromised**
