penetrance - proportion of genotypes that show expected genome
expressivity - individual expression of certain genome - some redheads have super red hair vs strawberry blonde
mosaicism - diff populations of cell in organism 
- germline - mutations- mom and dad
- somatic - after birth, issues , cells dispersed in areas 

1. friedreichs ataxia
	- AR, FXN gene in chromosoe 9 
	- frataxin gene, iron storage in the ETC/mt
	- iron depots happen in the mitochondria, cerebellum, spinal cords , dorsal root ganglia, heart, purkinje cells like in cerebellum
		- spinal cord thinner, dentate nuc of cerebellum bad, peripheral nerves highly impacted
	- gait + limb ataxia **with heart issues, scoliosis, diabetes,**, happens in late childhood + early teen years 
	- loss of lower extremity reflexes 
	- EMG/NCS , MRI, EKG, echo. genetic testing 
	- compare with charcot marie tooth 1+2 
	- TREAT: omaveloxolone - combo activation o Nrf2 and NF-kb helps with ATP production in mt and iron transport stuff 
2. charcot-marie-tooth
	1. most commonly inherited, AD mostly, groups of other types 
	2. result in **peripheral neuropathy by affecting myelin sheath or axons itself**
	3. we see champagne glass legs - lower extremity weakness, foot drop, arched feet, hammertoes, hand symptoms later on 
	4. variable penetrance, no change in life expectancy ; they maintain mobility 
	5. TREAT: PT 
	6. DX: EMG/NCS slows, and **onion bulb neuropathy!!!!!** and nerve biopsy on sural nerve(which is good bc it's primarily a sensory issue) + genetic testing
