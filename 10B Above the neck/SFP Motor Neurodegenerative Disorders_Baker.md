parkinsonism = hypokinetic movement disorder, 
- note that this is a broad term, one of which **parkinson's disease goes into** (this is one cause but the broad term has many)
- disturbance = **rigidity, expressionless face, stooped posture shuffling gait, slowed movement,s pill rolling tremor**

- disturbance in dopa pathways bt SN and BGs but not a single dz process. 
- not parkinson's dz , but a general dz process for parkinsonism - they have cavitary lacunar infarcs (htn) seen in the deep brain nuclei, seeing cavitary lesions in the insular cortex... 
	- death of the brain tissue from the infarcs. 
- this is a type of **lewy body disease - alpha-synucleiopathy**
	- lewy bodies - alpha synucleins will be buildups 
		- **they are round, pink and eosinophilic, pale halo.** - made up of alpha synuclein. 
		- can also get lewy neurites, deposits into the neuronal processes 
		- eventually those deposited neurons will die off. neuromelanin pushed off to side, these guys stand out greatly. and some free melanin there about to be cleared post cell death.

		- lewy bodies can be seen in the cortex too
			- pale pink round inclusion but only seen really with a immunostain!!!
			- knw that parkinson's dz 
	1. parkinson DZ - subtype of lewy body dz 
		1. triad: tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia
		2. idiopathic form most common, mainly manifest by 6th decade
		3. **dopaminergic meds heal this!**
		4. suspected etiologies like toxic exposures 
		5. cognitive impairment, or might have **REM sleep disorder, flail in bed**... but some CNS symptoms similar to dementia w/ lewy bodies 
			1. **note we can start out with parkinsons dz aka lewy bodies in our brainstem only for it to move onto infecting our cortex, for the dementia like symptoms**
		6. palor of SN!!! loss of these neurons they die and go away 
		7. locus coeruleus nucleus can be pallored too 
		8. no atrophy significantly seen in cortex!
			1. **NO atrophy of cortex - meaning lots of space between the gyri is NOT seen with this.**
	2. lewy body disease = similar pathology diff parts of brain! 
		1. if centered in brainstem = parkinsons dz
		2. if centered in cortex = dementia with lewy bodies 
- atypical parkinsonian symptoms
	- parkinsonium (bradykinesia/rigitity) + other symptoms not typical 
	1. progressive supranuclear palsy PSP / corticobasal degeneration CBD
		1. both tautopathies, globose tangles, frontal atrophy involving motor strip 
		2. parkinsonium **with a gaze problem, can't do up and down eye movements bc affected region in superior colliculus**
		3. basically vertical gaze palsy 
		4. tauopathy - **NOT!!!! the alpha synuclein!!!** - meaning tau , non-specific neurofibrillary tangle can happen anytime a large round nueron has a tangle that fills the cytoplasm 
			1. similar to alzheimers. 
			2. lewy bodies not seen 
			3. but hyperphosphorylated strings of tau is in a lot of round neuron cell bodies, harder to see. = this is a **globose tangle** - highlighted with a silver stain! 
			4. tau from protein that has something to do with protein transport and stuff in axons when hyperphosphorylated. 
		5. gross pathology - hummingbird sign - atrophy of midbrain! 
			1. meaning the beak or the rostral tegmentum will look like a **beak dip**, and narrowing 
			2. ![[Screenshot 2025-10-04 at 1.11.05 AM.png]]
		6. backwards falls
		7. atrophy in midbrain , SN pallor, and **spared peduncles.** 
		8. CBD - also has globose tangles and tau but the only thing diff: **ideomotor apraxia, alien limb phenomenon**, which is where if u ask someone to brush their hair they can't replicate motions of repetitive movements they do every day life ... and alien limb phenomenon with limbs having mind of their own  
			1. **specific region of atrophy - seveer in the motor cortex, asymmetric cortical atrophy, so symptoms are assymetric.**

	2. multiple system atrophy MSA - parkinsonium + autonomic dysfunction (UG problems, orthostatic hypotension, urinary issues, etc)
		1. **see shrunken and dark putamen bilaterally!!! atrophy of pons + middle cerebellar peduncle = hot cross bun sign** (don't worry about the differences between the two. lots of space bt the folia = atrophy.)
			1. hot cross buns - left with the cross in the middle of the pons. 
		2. there's pallor in SN ofc 
		3. **it's an alpha synucleinopathy but NO LEWY BODY** 
		4. instead there's **glial cytoplasmic inclusions of the brain** - myelinators f brain 
		5. doesn't improve with levodopa 
		6. pons flattened = atropic. 
		7. glial cytoplasmic inlusions will be stained 

huntington dz - hyperkinetic
- dominant and anticipation (triplet CAG repeat expansins = how young you'll present with the disorder)
- - 100% inherited!!! 
- symptoms in adulthood + hyperkinetic + dementia
	- **choreiform movement - involuntary jerky**
	- flattneed head of caudate aka atrophy of this caudate, cortex, putamen + loss of striate neurons 


ALS - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
- men>women 
- 5th decade + later 
- 5-10% familial mainly AD 
- **c9ORF72 = the primary gene alteration!!! and other one is SOD1**
- **TARDBP = causes ALS with frontotemporal lobar dementia - aphasia or disinhibited behavior off**
- UMN dysfunction and the LMN dysfunction at the same time - you lose in both ur cortex + spinal cord! 
- in the SC, the neurons are dying in the **anterior horn of this bc it's controlling ur motor,, in addition to peripheral nerve axons.**
- also loss of that corticospinal tracts aka lateral columns , upper part that we lost . 
- peripheral nerves in ALS = will be lost more and more , demyelinated
- **neurogenic atrophy = angular, shrunken skeletal muscle fibers, angular atrophic fibers** are seen!!!!! in ALS
- eventually after repeated episodes, we will see cycle of denervation + renervation an you end up with **group atrophy!**
