parkinsonism = hypokinetic movement disorder, 
- note that this is a broad term, one of which **parkinson's disease goes into** (this is one cause but the broad term has many)
- disturbance = **rigidity, expressionless face, stooped posture shuffling gait, slowed movement,s pill rolling tremor**

- disturbance in dopa pathways bt SN and BGs but not a single dz process. 
- not parkinson's dz , but a general dz process for parkinsonism - they have cavitary lacunar infarcs (htn) seen in the deep brain nuclei, seeing cavitary lesions in the insular cortex... 
	- death of the brain tissue from the infarcs. 
- this is a type of **lewy body disease - alpha-synucleiopathy**
	- lewy bodies - alpha synucleins will be buildups 
		- **they are round, pink and eosinophilic, pale halo.** - made up of alpha synuclein. 
		- can also get lewy neurites, deposits into the neuronal processes 
		- eventually those deposited neurons will die off. neuromelanin pushed off to side, these guys stand out greatly. and some free melanin there about to be cleared post cell death. 
		- ![[lewy bodies.png]]
		- lewy bodies can be seen in the cortex too
			- pale pink round inclusion but only seen really with a immunostain!!!
			- knw that parkinson's dz 
	1. parkinson DZ - subtype of lewy body dz 
		1. triad: tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia
		2. idiopathic form most common, mainly manifest by 6th decade
		3. **dopaminergic meds heal this!**
		4. suspected etiologies like toxic exposures 
		5. cognitive impairment, or might have **REM sleep disorder, flail in bed**... but some CNS symptoms similar to dementia w/ lewy bodies 
			1. **note we can start out with parkinsons dz aka lewy bodies in our brainstem only for it to move onto infecting our cortex, for the dementia like symptoms**
		6. palor of SN!!! loss of these neurons they die and go away 
		7. locus coeruleus nucleus can be pallored too 
		8. no atrophy significantly seen in cortex!
			1. **NO atrophy of cortex - meaning lots of space between the gyri is NOT seen with this.**
	2. lewy body disease = similar pathology diff parts of brain! 
		1. if centered in brainstem = parkinsons dz
		2. if centered in cortex = dementia with lewy bodies 
- atypical parkinsonian symptoms
	- parkinsonium (bradykinesia/rigitity) + other symptoms not typical  - basically **syndromes that look like parkinson's dz initially but with additional features.**
	1. ==progressive supranuclear palsy PSP / corticobasal degeneration CBD==
		1. both ==tautopathies==, ==globose== tangles, frontal atrophy involving motor strip 
		2. parkinsonium **with a ==gaze problem==, can't do up and down eye movements bc affected region in superior colliculus**
		3. basically vertical gaze palsy 
		4. tauopathy - **NOT!!!! the alpha synuclein!!!** - meaning tau , non-specific neurofibrillary tangle can happen anytime a large round nueron has a tangle that fills the cytoplasm 
			1. similar to alzheimers. 
			2. lewy bodies not seen 
			3. ==but hyperphosphorylated strings of tau is in a lot of round neuron cell bodies, harder to see. = this is a **globose tangle** - highlighted with a silver stain!== 
			4. ==tau from protein that has something to do with protein transport and stuff in axons when hyperphosphorylated.== 
		5. ==gross pathology - hummingbird sign - atrophy of midbrain!== 
			1. meaning the beak or the rostral tegmentum will look like a **beak dip**, and narrowing 
			2. ![[atrophy of midbrain.png]]
		6. backwards falls
		7. ==atrophy in midbrain , SN pallor, and **spared peduncles.**== 
		8. CBD - also has globose tangles and tau but the only thing diff==: **ideomotor apraxia, alien limb phenomenon**, which is where if u ask someone to brush their hair they can't replicate motions of repetitive movements they do every day life== ... and alien limb phenomenon with limbs having mind of their own  
			1. ==**specific region of atrophy - seveer in the motor cortex, asymmetric cortical atrophy, so symptoms are assymetric.**==

	2. multiple system atrophy MSA - parkinsonium + **autonomic** dysfunction (UG problems, orthostatic hypotension, urinary issues, etc)
		1. ==**see shrunken and dark putamen bilaterally!!! atrophy of pons + middle cerebellar peduncle = hot cross bun sign** (don't worry about the differences between the two. lots of space bt the folia = atrophy.)==
			1. hot cross buns - left with the cross in the middle of the pons. 
		2. there's pallor in SN ofc 
		3. ==**it's an alpha synucleinopathy but NO LEWY BODY**== 
		4. ==instead there's **glial cytoplasmic inclusions of the brain** - myelinators f brain== 
		5. ==doesn't improve with levodopa== 
		6. ==pons flattened = atropic.== 
		7. glial cytoplasmic inlusions will be stained 

huntington dz - hyperkinetic
- dominant and anticipation (triplet CAG repeat expansins = how young you'll present with the disorder)
- - 100% inherited!!! 
- symptoms in adulthood + hyperkinetic + dementia
	- **choreiform movement - involuntary jerky**
	- flattneed head of caudate aka atrophy of this caudate, cortex, putamen + loss of striate neurons 


ALS - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
- men>women 
- 5th decade + later 
- 5-10% familial mainly AD 
- ==**c9ORF72 = the primary gene alteration!!! and other one is SOD1**==
- **TARDBP = causes ALS with frontotemporal lobar dementia - aphasia or disinhibited behavior off**
- UMN dysfunction and the LMN dysfunction at the same time - you lose in both ur cortex + spinal cord! 
- in the SC, the neurons are dying in the **anterior horn of this bc it's controlling ur motor,, in addition to peripheral nerve axons.**
- also loss of that corticospinal tracts aka lateral columns , upper part that we lost . 
- peripheral nerves in ALS = will be lost more and more , demyelinated
- ==**neurogenic atrophy = angular, shrunken skeletal muscle fibers, angular atrophic fibers** are seen!!!!! in ALS==
- ==eventually after repeated episodes, we will see cycle of denervation + renervation an you end up with **group atrophy!**==
