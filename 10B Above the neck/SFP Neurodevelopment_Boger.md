#sensorimotor 

not as much cell signalling as before ? 
understand difff dev stages + where it happens for the nervous system + some pathologies 

focus on **induction, proliferation, migration, differentiation** - first 4 developmental stages

prenatal dev
- ==begins with neurulation in the 3rd week, neural tube making== 

neurulation - mesoderm on sides, notochord in the middle and right under the neural plates
1. ==recall **neuroectodermal** tissues differentiate from the ectoderm + thicken into neural plate (green = neural plate border)==
2. plate bends dorsally, w/ 2 ends jointing -> makes the neural crest = the borders where the plate joins, fusion. 
3. ==neural crest underneath ectoderm/closure of neural tube disconnects neural crest from epidermis==.... then the ==NCCs will differentate to most of the PNS== 
4. neural tube -> CNS stuff. ==notochord degenerates + only persists as nucleus pulposus== of the intervertebral discs. **other mesoderm diff-> somites** 


neurohistogenesis - 
- neuroepithelial cells - ==from neural tube== -> **CNS structures**
	- ==innermost layer - epidymal layer,== 
	- space in the neural tube = neural canal 
	- ==neuroepithelial cells turn into **neuroblasts, then neurons** -> axons, different neurons. brain and stufff, etc.== 
	- or ==neuroepithelial== turn into ==glioblasts==, giving rise to oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, astrocytes and adult stem cells. (from subventricular zone)
- neural crest cells -> PNS
	- ==NCCs gives rise to neuroblast -> turns into **primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia** and autonomic post-ganglionic cells in the periphery== 
	- ==schwann cells from directly NCC==. the myelinating glial cells of periphery. 
	- NCC-> the 2 meningial layers pia and arachnoid. (dura from mesenchymal cells instead)
- mesenchymal cells -> also give rise to the microglia?(controversy, some ppl think it might be coming from the yolk sac.)

neural prolif + differentiation  - in ==5 weks, we see many neuroblasts in ependymal layer and mantle layer== 
- neuroepithelium ->> ==3 layers of the spinal cord== 
	1. ==ependymal cells - near central canal, called the germinal layer(creation of neuroblasts hence germinal), will be the neuroblasts which migrate into the innermost==
		1. ==becomes ependymal lining and epithelium of choroid plexus==, 
		2. creation of neuroblasts happen here "germinal cell layer"
		3. ==germinal cell layer== in brain ==will still make those neuroblasts, but these migraters would then go to the rise of the **outer cellular layers, bc the gray matter is on the outside**== - this travel is based on cellular signals 
	2. ==mantle layer - neuroblasts which migrate to make the gray matter with dorsal and ventral horns -> gray matter== 
		1. gray matter of spinal cord 
	3. ==marginal layer - the processes of neurons from the mantle layer, sight for axonal pathways. -> white matter== 
		1. white matter of spinal cord 
note - neuroblasts, intermed progen cells, oligodendrocyte progen cells, astrocyte progen cells, adult stem cells, and ependymal cells all come from radial glial cells 

in ==transverse section of 5 1/2 wks of the spinal cord==
- this ==**sulcus limitans** will divide the ventral and dorsal plate.== 
- dorsal plate = gives rise to sensory cell bodies + inner neurons , sensory and/or coordinating cell populations
	- =="**alar** plate" = dorsal==
	- dorsal root ganglion cells - are sensory neurons from the NCC - 
- ventral or basal plate - differentiation into motor neuron (somatic + autonomic motor stuff)
- white matter (used to be marginal layer) - not as organized bc we got fibers which ascend and descend during development. 
-

PNS dev - day 28 and onwards
- NCC -> dorsal root ganglion cells, from the migrated ones 
- ==from **axonal guidance signaling(more in block11)** - processes of DRG cells **grow to target - one towards the dorsal horn and other towards the environment**==
- then the lower motor neurons send axons into developing skeletal musc via ventral roots/cranial nn
- central pregang axons - exit via ventral roots, termination on SNS gang in chain or paraSNS near innervating organs
- ==postgang cells grow **towards innervating target**==
- the target drives the directions of these axons growing , the visceral organs will be sending specific signals 

spinal cord + vertebral growth 
- recall - at birth, spinal cord is just about at full length! , extends full length of vertebral canal 
- ==spinal cord of fetus. - will full that whole canal!!!! - spinal cord is there at birth but not completely developped - they are there tho.== 
	- **will continue to grow post-natally bc the muscles they innervate are growing too!!!**
	- myelination occurs sometimes postnatally too. 
- **as the body grows, vertebral column grows but not he spinal cord.** 
recall it ends L1/2 of vertebral column with dural sac ending at s1-2 
- pass needle into the subarachnoid space blow the L2 
- needle below S1/2 in epidural location 

regional specification of developing brain - you have global regions that form 
- 28-36 days. 
	- prosencephalon - purple, gives rise to cerebrum 
	- mesencephalon  - green 
	- rhombencephalon  - red 
==recall - fetus is bent due to cephalic + cervical flexure at first!!!==
- 2 month 
	- prosencephalon -> 
		- ==telencephalon , cerebrum + hippocampus hyperthalamic regions; olfactory I== 
		- ==diencephalon -> thalamus/hypothalamus, mammillary, 3rd ventrical part , optic II== 
	- ==mesencephalon - midbrain / brainstem , oculomotor III, trochlear IV== 
	- rhombencephalon ->
		- ==metencephalon -> pons , cerebellum==
		- ==myelencephalon -> medulla...==  
- 6 mon 
	- more defined structures, gyri / sulci exist due to infolding, clear lines bt the cerebrum, brains stem/spinal cord + subcortical nuclei 
- 9 mon - brain is well-developped / differentiated 
	- sulci, gyri, basal ganglia, limbic structures, olfactory are differentiated!!! note that these continue to dev post-natally 
==at birth - we see the cerebrum not being completely formed lateral surface - **insular cortex**- visible in it, bc the frontal lobe hasn't completely enveloped the island yet.== 
![[adult derivs of fetal brain dev.png]]

cross sections of it all: 
at 5 1/2 wks, 
- very large midsections = large ventricular system 
- dorsal components all devoted to sensory cell populations , ventral ofc to the motor neurons
- diencephalon - similar to the alar plate 
- gray matter columns of spinal cord is extending into brainstem = 
- cranial + spinal nn provide innervation in segmental fashion 
differences  - mature brain not as organized as in development 
- ==once brain's mature, ventricular system is smaller== 
- ==loss of ventral/dorsal symmetry,== 
- sensory areas = **displaced LATERALLY in brain** - were once part of the alar plate
- ==nuclei happen instead of columns - columns are segmented off into these nuclei== 
- instead of a continuation of fiber bundles, we will have variety of nuclei
- white matter - scattered around in the brain.

pathology 
1. ==spina bifida - neural tube defect on posterior region-== 
	-  this tube doesn't go completely below the surface of embryo... so ==the tube doesn't close completely== 
	-  have parts of nervous system grow outside that area
	-  sclerotome cells can't migrate ovr and complete vertebral arch 
	1. ==myeloschisis - cord exposed on surface, no meninges, no canal forming, severe functional deficits + or pre-mortum ... repairable but that kid would have lower extemity deficits== 
	2. ==spinal bifida occulta - normal function,== but noticeable manifestations with the canal not closing , basically it's where it's supposed to be j not complete closure, ==**tuft of hair or fat pad is external, small dimple that exists**==
	3. ==meningocele== - ==normal spinal cord, but swelling of meninges with CSF== thru the defect; repairable 
	4. ==meningomyelocele== - ==you have that meningeal outgrowth but **with the SC ):** , making it more defect, is repairable , done in utero prodominantly== 

lack of closing on neural tube on head
1. ==encephalocele - midline cranial bones fail to ossify, so the meninges project out in a circle, with or without the brain tissue; its fine.==. sometimes repairable. remove that dead brain tissue on the inside f that. doesn't impact mortality much. 
2. ==anecephaly - more extreme, common in stillborns, terminal, extreme neural tube defect, **anterior neuropore cannot close - brain + neurocranium absent** + born without cerebrum== 
3. ==arnold-chiari malformation - part of **cerebellum + medulla herniate thru foramen magnum**, this blocks CSF flow ... some are asymptomatic and some are severe== impacts on function or CSF flow. ==type 2 of this is associated with meningomyelocele==, since type 2 is it herniating into the back of the head, and then the cord herniates thru with the meningomyelocele ...
