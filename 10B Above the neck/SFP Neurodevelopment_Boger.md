#sensorimotor 

not as much cell signalling as before ? 
understand difff dev stages + where it happens for the nervous system + some pathologies 

focus on induction, proliferation, migration, differentiation - first 4 developmental stages

prenatal dev
- begins with neurulation in the 3rd week, neural tube making 

neurulation - mesoderm on sides, notochord in the middle and right under the neural plates
1. recall **neuroectodermal** tissues diff from the ectoderm + thicken into neural plate (green = neural plate border)
2. plate bends dorsally, w/ 2 ends jointing -> makes the neural crest = the borders where the plate joins, fusion. 
3. neural crest underneath ectoderm/closure of neural tube disconnects neural crest from epidermis.... then the NCCs will differentate to most of the PNS 
4. neural tube -> CNS stuff. notochord degenerates + only persists as nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. other mesoderm diff-> somites 


neurohistogenesis - 
- neuroepithelial cells - from neural tube -> **CNS structures**
	- innermost layer - epidymal layer, 
	- space in the neural tube = neural canal 
	- neuroepithelial cells turn into **neuroblasts, then neurons** -> axons, different neurons. brain and stufff, etc. 
	- or neuroepithelial turn into ==glioblasts==, giving rise to oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, astrocytes and adult stem cells. (from subventricular zone)
- neural crest cells -> PNS
	- gives rise to neuroblast -> turns into **primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia** and autonomic post-ganglionic cells in the periphery 
	- schwann cells from directly NCC. the myelinating glial cells of periphery. 
	- NCC-> the 2 meningial layers pia and arachnoid. (dura from mesenchymal cells instead)
- mesenchymal cells -> also give rise to the microglia?(controversy, some ppl think it might be coming from the yolk sac.)

neural prolif + differentiation  - in 5 weks, we see many neuroblasts in ependhymal layer and mantle layer 
- neuroepithelium ->> 3 layers of the spinal cord 
	1. ependymal cells - near central canal, called the germinal layer, will be the neuroblasts which migrate into the innermost
		1. becoms ependymal lining and epithelium fo choroid plexus, 
		2. creation of neuroblasts happen here "germinal cell layer"
		3. germinal cell layer in brain will still make those neuroblasts, but these migraters would then go to the rise of the **outer cellular layers, bc the gray matter is on the outside** - this travel is based on cllular signals 
	2. mantle layer - neuroblasts which migrate to make the gray mattr with dorsal and ventral horns 
		1. gray matter of spinal cord 
	3. marginal layer - the processes of neurons from the mantle layer, sight for axonal pathways. 
		1. white matter of spinal cord 
note - neuroblasts, intermed progen cells, oligodendrocyte progen cells, astrocyte progen cells, adult stem cells, and ependymal cells all come from radial glial clls 
in transverse section of 5 1/2 wks of the spinal cord
- this **sulcus limitans** will divide the ventral and dorsal plate. 
- dorsal plate = gives rise to sensory cell bodies + inner neurons , sensory and/or coordinating cell populations
	- "**alar** plate"
	- dorsal root ganglion cells - are sensory neurons from the NCC - 
- ventral or basal plate - differentiation into motor neuron (somatic + autonomic motor stuff)
- white matter (used to be marginal layer) - not as organized bc we got fibers which ascend and descend during development. 
-

PNS dev - day 28 and onwards
- NCC -> dorsal root ganglion cells, from the migrated ones 
- from **axonal guidance signalling(more in block11)** - processes of DRG cells **grow to target - one towards hte dorsal horn and other towards the environment**
- then the lower motor neurons send axons into developing skeletal musc via ventral roots/cranial nn
- central pregang axons - exit via ventral roots, termination on SNS gang in chain or paraSNS near innervating organs
- postgang cells grow **towards innervating target**
- the target drives the directions of these axons growing , the viscerlal organs will be sending specific signals 

spinal cord + vertebral growth 
- recall - at birth, spinal cord is just about at full length! , extends full length of vertebral canal 
- spinal cord of fetus. - will full that whole canal!!!! - spinal cord is there at birth but not completely developped - they are there tho. 
	- **will continue to grow post-natally bc the muscles they innervate are growing too!!!**
	- myelination occurs sometimes postnatally too. 
- **as the body grows, vertebral column grows but not he spinal cord.** 
recall it ends L1/2 of vertebral column with dural sac ending at s1-2 
- pass needle into the subarachnoid space blow the L2 
- needle below S1/2 in epidural location 

regional specification of developing brain - you have global regions that form 
- 28-36 days. 
	- prosencephalon - purple, gives rise to cerebrum 
	- mesencephalon  - green 
	- rhombencephalon  - red 
recall - fetus is bent due to cephalic + cervical flexure at first!!!
- 2 month 
	- prosencephalon -> 
		- telencephalon , cerebrum + thalamus hyperthalamic regions
		- diencephalon -> 
	- mesencephalon - midbrain / brainstem 
	- rhombencephalon ->
		- metencephalon -> pons , cerebellum
		- myelencephalon -> medulla...  
- 6 mon 
	- more defined structures, gyri / sulci exist due to infolding, clear lines bt the cerebrum, brains stem/spinal cord + subcortical nuclei 
- 9 mon - brain is well-developped / differentiated 
	- sulci, gyri, basal ganglia, limbic structures, olfactory are differentiated!!! note that these continue to dev post-natally 
at birth - we see the cerebrum not being completely formed lateral surface - **insular cortex**- visible in it, bc the frontal lobe hasn't completely envelopped the island yet. 
![[adult derivs of fetal brain dev.png]]

cross sections of it all: 
at 5 1/2 wks, 
- very large midsections = large ventricular system 
- dorsal components all devoted to sensory cell populations , ventral ofc to the motor neurons
- diencephalon - similar to the alar plate 
- gray matter columns of spinal cord is extending into brainstem = 
- cranial + spinal nn provide innervation in segmental fashion 
differences  - mature brain not as organized as in development 
- once brain's mature, ventricular system is smaller 
- loss of ventral/dorsal symmetry, 
- sensory areas = **displaced LATERALLY in brain** - were once part of the alar plate
- nuclei happen instead of columns - columns are segmented off into these nuclei 
- instead of a continuation of fiber bundles, we will have variety of nuclei
- white matter - scattered around in the brain.

pathology 
1. spina bifida - neural tube defect on posterior region- 
	-  this tube doesn't go completely below the surface of embryo... so the tube doesn't close completely 
	-  have parts of nervous system grow outside that area
	-  sclerotome cells can't migrate ovr and complete vertebral arch 
	1. myeloschisis - cord exposed on surface, no meninges, no canal forming, severe functional deficits + or pre-mortum ... repairable but that kid would have lower extemity deficits 
	2. spinal bifida occulta - normal function, but noticeable manifestations with the canal not closing , basically it's where it's supposed to be j not complete closure, **tuft of hair or fat pad is external, small dimple that exists**
	3. meningocele - normal spinal cord, but swelling of meninges with CSF thru the defect; repairable 
	4. meningomyelocele - you have that meningeal outgrowth but **with the SC ):** , making it more defect, is repairable , done in utero prodominantly 

lack of clsing on neural tube on head
1. encephalocele - midline cranial bones fail to ossify, so the meninges project out in a circle, with or without the brain tissue. sometimes repairable. remove that dead brain tissue on the inside f that. doesn't impact mortality much. 
2. anecephaly - more extreme, common in stillborns, terminal, extreme neural tube defect, **anterior neuropore cannot close - brain + neurocranium absent** + born without cerebrum 
3. arnold-chiari malformation - part of **cerebellum + medulla herniate thru foramen magnum**, this blocks CSF flow ... some are asymptomatic and some are severe impacts on function or CSF flow. type 2 of this is associated with meningomyelocele, since type 2 is it herniating into the back of the head, and then the cord herniates thru with the meningomyelocele ...
