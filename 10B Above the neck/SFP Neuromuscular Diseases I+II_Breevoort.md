anki this out!!!
electrodiagnostic testing is huge in finding out where it's at. an extension of hx and physical exam. doing what nerves do in the peripheral and thse will carry the signal. looking at speed of conduction (myelination) and amplitude(amount of axons avaliable to depolarize the muscle)

3 main patterns of nerve conduction fibers 
- less amplitude 
- difffuse demylination - slowing of response 
- focal demyelination =  losing myelin in only one or other area - happens in compressive or entrapive demylinations, **getting conduction block**

1. transverse myelitis - inflammation of spinal cord's **myelin**
	- otherwise healthy 28 yo women, progressive weakness 3 days ago, numbness below breast, urinary urgency, neck flexion -> eleectrical sensation radiating down to coccyx flexing meninges so it sends out a thing + recent URI.... elevated WBCs, both motor and sensory fucked up startng at a singular level downwards, and T2 on imaging 
	- bilateral signs of this all. 
	1. transverse - meaning acute or subacute across one segment
	2. usually post-infectious or with any types o autoimmune dz like MS, sjogrens, lupus, paraneoplastic, or idiopathic 
	3. note this is a syndrome not a disease.
	4. DX: MRI spine but like some don't have these. spans 3-4 segments of spinal cord, we see **T2 hyperintensity more light**
	5. sr - **AQP4-Ab, MOG-ab, ana, esr, crp, and lumbar puncture shows WBCs/IGG index**
	6. both motor and the sensory components dmg'd , everything distal of lesion 
	7. symptoms vary greatly, 
	8. weakness + spasticity with motor, and numbness, tingling, **bandlike sensation** and a lot of patients get **autonomic issues, urinary retention, bowel dysfunction**
	9. rapid evolution - hours-days, very common postviral , any age group but frequent in teen years or young 
	10. TREAT: high dose IV steroids or plasma exchange otherwise, supportive care. very variable prognosis early dx and treatment is huge 
	11. diffferential dx - MS (mutlifocal/patchy CNS lesions, relapsing corse), guillain barre(ascending weakness with no SC lesion), and spinal cord compression (hx of trauma/cancer + imaging findings)
2. motor neuron dz - key feature - no sensory abnormalities, and this is all **often patchy distribution, often *asymmetric* with no obvious pattern of proximal v distal muscle involvement**
	1. ALS - acquired 
		1. mostly sporadic, 10% familial, overall male predominance, peak age 55-75 
		2. note - there probably is a lot of cellular level stuff liek inflammation, mt functin disruptions etc. hard to treat it ):
		3. **weakness without sensory loss, UMN and LMN signs**
		4. somee... bulbar muscles in 25% initially - hard to speak, chew and swallow ): **extraocular muscles are not impacted in spite of this bulbar involvement**
			1. dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhea, tongue, sialorrhea. 
			2. tongue fasciculations - keep their tongue in mouth and then really test to see it there. 
			3. UMN - seen with spasticity, **"i just fell and i dont know why?"** = hyperreflexia of bulbar region UMN thing would be with jaw jerk when hitting it sign 
		5. focal spread: characteristically begins in 1 UE -> contralateral UE -> ipsilateral LE and contralateral LE -> bulbar muscles. 
		6. testing spasticity is hard, clinical with reflexes. , weakness and atrophy with LMN etc. painless muscle twitches or fasciculations 
		7. **split-hand syndrome** - atrophy in 1st dorsal interossei muscle, preservation of the hypothenar eminence, yet the thenar muscles are super weak. 
		8. **no bowel or bladder incontinence**
		9. 20-40% cognitive impairment 
		10. PMA = progressive muscular atrophy = "slowly progressive ALS, better prognosis, more of the **lower motor neuron issues**", type of ALS 
		11. PLS = progressive lateral sclerosis, **upper motor neurons only**, corticobulbar involvement a lot o that, dx of exclusion , type of ALS 
		12. LABS: CBC, CMP, ESR, CK, CSF to check for infection ... brain imging might see some intensities in motor cortex. 
		13. **rule out this ALS mimic!!!! - with severe cervical stenosis we see upper motor neuron issues with lesion in the spinal cord AND polyradiculopathy from nerves getting pinched!!!!**
		14. TREAT: respiratory management and preserving it as well as nutrition is initiated early - a lot of symptom management 
	2. SMA- hereditary , SMN1 missing or not working but SMN2 backup genes will not really make too much protin. the type and severity depends on how much SMN2 u have. 
		1. spinal muscular atrophies = there are some clinical subtypes of this 
		2. type 1 = before 6 months, no sitting
		3. type 2 = onset 5-18 mon, sits but no walk
		4. type 3 = childhood post 12 mon, walking 
		5. type 4 = normal milestones, after 30 years old 
		6. TREAT: spinraza - been.a gamechanger with an antisense oligonuc and makes the gene there... helps us do drug therapies and revolutionary treatment. 
		7. now SMA is a newborn screening to treat before the symptomatic things 
	3. kennedy's dz - SBMA  - x linked male dz **which mimics ALS**
3. neuromuscular junction dz
	1. Myasthenia gravis - 
		1. antibdies of ACH **postsynaptic receptors.**
		2. anticholinesterase inhibitors are huge .... 
		3. 80% have IgG against the ACH receptors... but 10% have anti-**MuSK prote**
	2. LEMS
		1. lambert eaton - autoantibodies against **CA2+ channels, blocking the calcium influx, therefore preventing the ACH release.**
4. inflammatory disorders of peripheral nerve- > polyradiculoneuropathies
		1. inflammation of the myelin sheath **proximally at root and distally along the peripheral nerve - > prox and distal signs and symptoms early and areflexia**
	1. AIDP - acute inflammatory demyelinating poly neuropathy - this is guillain barre 
		1. any inflammatory or infectious causes
		2. common - immune stimulation 
		3. like 98% reach the nadir by 4 weeks, **10-14 days symptom onset to nadir**  
		4. way more motor deficits than senosry neuropathy , **symmetric and ascending, hypo/areflexia, CNs can be involved like facial droop common**
		5. **autonomic abnormalities - cardiac arrhythmias, labile BP, orthostatics, bowels, GI involvement** 
		6. **LABS: albuminocytologic dissociation, more protein, normal cell count in CSF... neuroimaging - thickening and enhancement of intrathecal nerve roots + cuada equina!!!**
		7. mean time to improv starts at 28 days and recovery happens by 200 days 
		8. 85% recover completely 15% permenant deficits... 
		9. **this is monophasic disease course** 
		10. subtypes: classical AIDP more common 
		11. axonal variant - more severe goes beyond the demyelination! AMAN and AMSAN ilke in asia 
		12. TREAT: ventilation and IVIG ...**steroids make this worse.**
	2. **miller fisher syndrome = anti-GQ1b antibody , opthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia, more common in east asia**
	3. CIDP - similar to guillain barre, but this **period of time is 6 weeks of infection**
		1. or immune stress 
		2. multifocal **patchy demyelination, predom impacting the spinal nerve roots, plexuses + prox nerve trunks**
		3. idiopathic, tret this symtpoms, **generalized weakness symmetric pattern, relapsing course**
		4. LABS: prog 2 months, weakness more than sensory deficits, symmetical, proximal and distal muscles, **widespread reflex reduction.**
		5. CSF protein up and normal WBC , **enlarged nerves on MRI**
5. hereditary polyneuropathy - 
	1. charcot-marie-tooth - CMT - most common inherited NM condition in the world 
		1. know there are many subtypes 
		2. CMT1 - demyelinating 
			1. CMT1A = most common PMP22 duplication 
			2. these are **distal hereditary motor neuropathies, meaning muscle weakness + atrophy without any sensory deficits**
		3. CMT2 = axonal 
		4. classically - **high arches, hammer toes with chronic muscle loss , thinning of calves, family hx autosomal dom, chronic and slowly progressive**
		5. NO neuropathic pain, only loss of **large fiber nerves... distal motor weakness is predominant, atrophy too**
		6. hearing loss is common
