anki this out!!!
electrodiagnostic testing is huge in finding out where it's at. an extension of hx and physical exam. doing what nerves do in the peripheral and thse will carry the signal. looking at speed of conduction (myelination) and amplitude(amount of axons avaliable to depolarize the muscle)

3 main patterns of nerve conduction fibers 
- less amplitude 
- difffuse demylination - slowing of response 
- focal demyelination =  losing myelin in only one or other area - happens in compressive or entrapive demylinations, **getting conduction block**

1. transverse myelitis - inflammation of spinal cord's **myelin**
	- otherwise healthy 28 yo women, progressive weakness 3 days ago, numbness below breast, urinary urgency, neck flexion -> eleectrical sensation radiating down to coccyx flexing meninges so it sends out a thing + recent URI.... elevated WBCs, both motor and sensory fucked up startng at a singular level downwards, and T2 on imaging 
	- bilateral signs of this all. 
	1. transverse - meaning acute or subacute across one segment
	2. usually post-infectious or with any types o autoimmune dz like MS, sjogrens, lupus, paraneoplastic, or idiopathic 
	3. note this is a syndrome not a disease.
	4. DX: MRI spine but like some don't have these. spans 3-4 segments of spinal cord, we see **T2 hyperintensity more light**
	5. sr - **AQP4-Ab, MOG-ab, ana, esr, crp, and lumbar puncture shows WBCs/IGG index**
	6. ==both motor and the sensory components dmg'd , everything distal of lesion== 
	7. symptoms vary greatly, 
	8. ==weakness + spasticity with motor, and numbness, tingling, **bandlike sensation** and a lot of patients get **autonomic issues, urinary retention, bowel dysfunction**==
	9. rapid evolution - hours-days, very common postviral , any age group but frequent in teen years or young 
	10. TREAT: high dose IV steroids or plasma exchange otherwise, supportive care. very variable prognosis early dx and treatment is huge 
	11. diffferential dx - MS (mutlifocal/patchy CNS lesions, ==relapsing== corse), guillain barre(ascending weakness with no SC lesion), and spinal cord compression (hx of trauma/cancer + imaging findings)
2. motor neuron dz - key feature - no sensory abnormalities, and this is a==ll **often patchy distribution, often *asymmetric* with no obvious pattern of proximal v distal muscle involvement**==
	1. ALS - acquired 
		1. mostly sporadic, 10% familial, overall male predominance, peak age 55-75 
		2. note - there probably is a lot of cellular level stuff liek inflammation, mt functin disruptions etc. hard to treat it ):
		3. **weakness without sensory loss, UMN and LMN signs**
		4. ==somee... bulbar muscles in 25% initially - hard to speak, chew and swallow ): **extraocular muscles are not impacted in spite of this bulbar involvement**==
			1. dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhea, tongue, sialorrhea. 
			2. tongue fasciculations - keep their tongue in mouth and then really test to see it there. 
			3. UMN - seen with spasticity, **"i just fell and i dont know why?"** = hyperreflexia of bulbar region UMN thing would be with jaw jerk when hitting it sign 
		5. focal spread: characteristically begins in 1 UE -> contralateral UE -> ipsilateral LE and contralateral LE -> bulbar muscles. 
		6. testing spasticity is hard, clinical with reflexes. , weakness and atrophy with LMN etc. painless muscle twitches or fasciculations 
		7. **split-hand syndrome** - atrophy in 1st dorsal interossei muscle, preservation of the hypothenar eminence, yet the thenar muscles are super weak. 
		8. **no bowel or bladder incontinence**
		9. 20-40% cognitive impairment 
		10. ==**PMA** = progressive muscular atrophy== = "slowly progressive ALS, better prognosis==, more of the **lower motor neuron issues**"==, type of ALS 
		11. **PLS** = progressive lateral sclerosis==, **upper motor neurons only**, **c==orticobulbar** involvement a lot o that, dx of exclusion , type of ALS== 
		12. LABS: CBC, CMP, ESR, CK, CSF to check for infection ... brain imging might see some intensities in motor cortex. 
		13. **rule out this ALS mimic!!!! - with ==severe cervical stenosis== we see upper motor neuron issues with lesion in the spinal cord AND polyradiculopathy from nerves getting pinched!!!!**
		14. TREAT: respiratory management and preserving it as well as nutrition is initiated early - a lot of symptom management 
	2. ==SMA spinal muscular atrophy== - hereditary , SMN1 missing or not working but SMN2 backup genes will not really make too much protin. the type and severity depends on how much SMN2 u have. 
		1. spinal muscular atrophies = there are some clinical subtypes of this 
		2. type 1 = before 6 months, no sitting
		3. type 2 = onset 5-18 mon, sits but no walk
		4. type 3 = childhood post 12 mon, walking 
		5. type 4 = normal milestones, after 30 years old 
		6. TREAT: spinraza - been.a gamechanger with an antisense oligonuc and makes the gene there... helps us do drug therapies and revolutionary treatment. 
		7. now SMA is a newborn screening to treat before the symptomatic things 
	3. ==kennedy's dz - SBMA  - x linked male dz **which mimics ALS**==
3. neuromuscular junction dz
	1. Myasthenia gravis - 
		1. antibdies of ACH **postsynaptic receptors.**
		2. anticholinesterase inhibitors are huge .... 
		3. 80% have IgG against the ACH receptors... but 10% have anti-**MuSK proteins assocciated with the receptor...** and some are questionably seronegative. 
		4. ==**this is BIMODAL age of onset, women under 40 and then older men!!**==
		5. **extraocular weakness with ptosis droopy and diplopia, later will develop limb + bulbar muscle weakness** - 
		6. huge is **fatigability of weakness, WORSENING of the disease and weakness after sustained contraction!!!**
		7. ==also **tendon reflex + sensory normal**==
		8. MuSK myasthenia gravis
			1. occular, facial and bulbar involvement = eyebrow droop, smoothing forehead + droopy mouth. 
			2. ==acute with **rapid progression in weeks, and early respiratory crises!!!** tachycardia, reduced sounds, immeinently get to hospital, use FVC== 
			3. muscle atrophy is seen!! symptoms no fluccuation and no response to ACHesterase inhibitors 
		9. DX - EMG single fiber gold standard, single nerve stimulated multiple times to see decrement in response (fatigability)
		10. ==chest CT - 10-15% have **associated thymoma!!**==
		11. avoid exacerbating factors: infections, trauma, pstop stress, withdrawal of inhibitors, **using steroids TOO rapidly,** electrolyte imbalance , anemia, and **gentamicin, chloroquine, succinylcholine, botox**
		12. TREAT: **pyridostigmine - blocks acetylcholinesterase.... cholinergic AEs abdominal cramps, diarrhea, inc sweating sludge**
			1. fixed deficits ptosis and diplopia opthalmic 
		13. maintinence treatmet - **prednisone - bc autoimmune. titrate it slowly**
		14. thymonectomy only for ppl with thymomas 
	2. LEMS
		1. ==lambert eaton - presynaptic; autoantibodies against **CA2+ voltage gated channels, blocking the calcium influx, therefore preventing the ACH release.**==
		2. rare dz, idiopathic or **paraneoplastic like ==SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMA**==
		3. will precede cancer dx by up to 2 years, will have to monitor the development of cancers
		4. tumor associated, 58-60  and nontumr 35 and late 50s 
		5. prognosis varies. muscle strength at initial eval= only factor that can predict long term dz control. 
		6. **proximal leg + arm weakness, NO BULBAR weakness AND respiratory weakness is rare**
		7. in exam room seems nearly normla 
		8. **autonomic dysfunction = dry mouth and eyes!!!!**
		9. **reduced reflexes!! is huge, know that reflex test FIRST, bc they improve after brief exercise**
		10. anti-P/Q type calcium channel, majorty of limbs poz, but 15% are seronegative. 
		11. congenital myasthenic syndromes - inherited disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding for proteins essential for integrity of neuromuscular transmission - **fatigable muscle weakness**; will be classed on location of mutation, presynaptic, synaptic, post-synaptic ... variable
4. ==inflammatory disorders of peripheral nerve- > polyradiculoneuropathies==
		1. inflammation of the myelin sheath **proximally at root and distally along the peripheral nerve - > prox and distal signs and symptoms early and areflexia**
	1. ==AIDP - acute inflammatory demyelinating poly neuropathy - this is guillain barre== 
		1. any inflammatory or infectious causes
		2. common - immune stimulation 
		3. like 98% reach the nadir by 4 weeks, **10-14 days symptom onset to nadir**  
		4. way more motor deficits than senosry neuropathy , **symmetric and ascending, hypo/areflexia, CNs can be involved like facial droop common**
		5. **autonomic abnormalities - cardiac arrhythmias, labile BP, orthostatics, bowels, GI involvement** 
		6. **LABS: albuminocytologic dissociation, more protein, normal cell count in CSF... neuroimaging - thickening and enhancement of intrathecal nerve roots + cuada equina!!!**
		7. mean time to improv starts at 28 days and recovery happens by 200 days 
		8. 85% recover completely 15% permenant deficits... 
		9. **this is monophasic disease course** 
		10. subtypes: classical AIDP more common 
		11. axonal variant - more severe goes beyond the demyelination! AMAN and AMSAN ilke in asia 
		12. TREAT: ventilation and IVIG ...**steroids make this worse.**
	2. ==**miller fisher syndrome = anti-GQ1b antibody , opthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia, more common in east asia**==
	3. CIDP - similar to guillain barre, but this **period of time is 6 weeks of infection**
		1. or immune stress   
		2. ==multifocal **patchy demyelination, predom impacting the spinal nerve roots, plexuses + prox nerve trunks**==
		3. idiopathic, tret this symtpoms, **generalized weakness symmetric pattern, relapsing course**
		4. LABS: prog 2 months, weakness more than sensory deficits, symmetical, proximal and distal muscles, **widespread reflex reduction.**
		5. CSF protein up and normal WBC , **enlarged nerves on MRI**
5. ==hereditary polyneuropathy -== 
	1. ==charcot-marie-tooth - CMT - most common inherited NM condition in the world== 
		1. know there are many subtypes 
		2. CMT1 - demyelinating 
			1. ==CMT1A== = most common ==PMP22== duplication 
			2. these are ==**distal hereditary motor neuropathies, meaning muscle weakness + atrophy without any sensory deficits**==
		3. ==CMT2 = axonal== 
		4. classically - ==**high arches, hammer toes with chronic muscle loss== , thinning of calves, family hx autosomal dom, chronic and slowly progressive**
		5. NO neuropathic pain, only loss of **large fiber nerves... distal motor weakness is predominant, atrophy too**
		6. hearing loss is common 
hereditary myopathies
- myopathy itself is not realated to dz in innervation nor NMJ
- can be impairments to biochem procsses or structure of muscles itself. 
1. dystrophinopathis - most often 
2. duchenne + beckers - dystrophin X chromosome
	1. DMD - early age of onset, de novo and frameshift mutations 
	2. BMD - no frameshift, and variable age. less extreme 
		1. presenting later in adolsence
		2. variable, slowly progressive, still soem dystrophin protein
		3. **not uncommon - heart failure as presenting sign**
		4. female carriers - asymptomatic, cardiac disease signs tho ): 
	3. dystrophin - is in skeletal and ==cardiac and brain + retina== (cognitive and eyesight impairment).  this will help you link the muscle to the ECM ... important for contraction - we get loss of this = muscular breakdown 
	4. calf enlargement - **pseudohypertorphy, fat deposits**
	5. gower's sign = climb their hands up their legs, and then lose abiilties + most kids don't live beyond 30s and later now
	6. myopathic gait - seeing a wiggle of pelvis, "strutting, toe walkig"
3. ==limb-girdle muscular dystrophy== 
	1. progressive **proximal muscle atrophy + weakness in shoulder + hip girdle**
		1. AD forms = LGMD1 - tend to have older age of onset, slow progression, minimal to no elevations of CK (muscle breakdown) 
		2. AR forms - LGMD2 younger age + faster prog, CK elevation and more prevalent 
	2. ==clinically - **hard reaching overhead, lifting objs off floor, hard to get off floor, stairs**==
	3. legs giving out 
	4. ==resp weakness can follow after losing ambulation, and cardiomyopathy might develop but may be spared.== 
4. ==myotonic muscular dystrophy== 
	1. DM1 and DM2
	2. DM1 = CTG repeat in DMPK autonosomal dom !!!! **50-1000 CTG repeats** and longer repeat = early symptoms + more severe
		1. ==**faical waeakness, ptosis, prox truncal weakness and distal limb muscles**==
		2. ==myotonia is huge - grip myotnia and jaw clenching oromandibular myotonia== 
	3. DM2 = no correlation bt repeat lenght ... expanded CCTG on CNBP gene
		1. weakness of neck flexion, more **proximal, myotonia less common, but cramping and muscle pain**
		2. oftn misdx with fibromyalgia 
	4. both intefere with RNa splicing , multisystem dz 
	5. anticipation - can be congenital, floppy baby dz, cognitive difficultieis , 
	6. genetic testing and eveyrhitng helps 
	7. ==myotonia - **meaning muscles will contract but can't uncontract or relax!!!!!** due to alterations of chloride channel.== 
	8. ==both get **cataracts and cardiac arrhythmia sudden deaths - might get this in their family!!!**==
	9. ==**tent mouth - congenital from facial weakness**==
	10. ==hatchet face = frontal balding and temporal wasting seen frontal balding==
	11. shank sign - proximal weakness. 
	12. percussion myotonia - seen with hitting the muscle and grip myotonia - if they grip hard, the grip would stay. 
skeletal muscle channelopathies - 
- inability of msucle to contract/relax - flouride , sodium, potassium channels
	- **hallmark - episodic aka paroxysmal, improving after activities**
	- commonly **leg muscles impacted in case of myotonia**
	- usually subtle - episodes of weakness, coach gives salt tablets and all that 
	- ==**hyperkalemic disorders** = any time, mins to hours, high K+ foods, rest after exercise, cold, SCN4A==
	- ==**hypokalemic** - night/early morning, hours to days, high carb meals, sustained exercise, thyrotoxicosis, CACNA1S/SCN4A==
	- we see **paralysis!!! usually but not all weakness is paralysis**, weakness can be task specific and limited to one spot 
	- typically normal in paralysis but some get proximal myopathy 
	- ==in mytonia - **stiff gait pattern.**==
	- now we do genetic stuff
	- TREAT: avoid symptom triggers + lifestyle , low intensty and low resistance training.... 
	- long term acetalzolamide 
- non-dystrophic myotonia
- periodic paralysis = episodes of weakness. 
- metabolic myopatis - FA oxidation, glycogen storage, mt metabolism 
1. glycogen storage dz - Mcardle  or pompes disease 
	1. ==**mcardles - mutation in myophosphorylase, most common metabolic myopathy**==
		1. getting symptoms within first seconds to minutes of activities
		2. ==rhabdomyolysis, acute risk in CK== 
		3. ==cramping begins and can be alleviated by reducing intensity or resting and then careful resuming - **2nd wind phenomenon**==
		4. childhood hx of pigmenturia, SOB, **fewer symptoms after high carb meal...**
2. FA ox defect - carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 deficiency , VLC acyl-coa DH deficiency 
	1. ==CPT2 deficiency== 
		1. ==**exercise induced myalgia not cramping...**==
		2. ==delayed muscle soreness!!!==
		3. fasting, prolonged exercise or illness precipitates sickness, 
		4. tREAT: avoid dz triggers + most tolerated resistance exercise or short burst type activity 
		5. ==**eat higher carb foods immediately be4 exercise**== 
3. mt myopathy - mtDNA mutatins like melas, cytb, cytc oxidase 

in muscle metabolism we often use glucose in short duration and 
- carbs = higher intensitives; main source of this from **glycogen**
- free fatty acid breakdown = longer duration endurence 

1. ==friedreich Ataxia - most common AR ataxia== 
	1. GAA repeat on **frataxin gene** - this assists in formation of **iron sulfur clusters acting as coffactors in the ETC!!!**
	2. age of onset + severeity related to repeat length 
	3. affects: dorsal root ganglia, spinocerebellar tracts + posterior columns!!!
		1. ==gait + limb ataxia, dysarthria, sensory changes, areflexia and weakness==
		2. ==**nonneurologic symptoms from ETC meddling - diabetes, sensorineural hearing loss, scoliosis, cardiomyopathy**  ; disruptions in endocrine system.== 
		3. ==degen - **lateral corticospinal tract = spastic paralysis** ,==
		4. spinocerebellar tract (ataxia)
		5. dorsal columns - sensory vibration + proprioception bad along with dorsal root ganglia loss. 
		6.
