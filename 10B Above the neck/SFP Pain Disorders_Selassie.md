central pain syndromes

1. fibromyalgia
	1. widespread MSK pain, 2-8% more common in women 
	2. happens in childhood/adolescence, strong fam hx of chronic pain 
	3. psych stress, trauma, certain infections; 50% genetic 50% environmental, and clusters with diff chronic pain conditions 
	4. **amplification of central pain processing - central sensitization., fMRI shows mild pressure touch as pain**
		1. sunglasses bc fluorescent eyes will hurt their eyes 
		2. on a cellular level - changes to **inc glutamate in the insula cortex + dorsal horn of spinal cord + downregulation of inhibitory NT like GABA**
		3. also inc endogenous mu opiid release + dopaminergic activity 
		4. more glutamate -> upregulation of NMDA receptors, so we get better at transmitting the pain! a huge cycle! 
	5. chronic pain is always 3+ months that is widespread + involves many sites + regions, migratory or wax/wane
	6. associated w/ fatigue, **sleep disorders,** insomnia, cognitive problems + somatic issues. 
	7. physical exam = diffuse tenderness on joints + soft tissues!!! 4/5 body regions upper L, upper R, lower L etc.
		1. make sure there's **absence of erythema + swelling of joint + focal neurological findings. sensitive to inflation of BP cuff.**
		2. no imaging studies, but use sleep studies + pysch assessments. 
		3. do: CBC, CRP, ESR and TSH to rule out inflammation or infection and thyroid
		4. note: serological panels like ANA and RF NOT necessary 
	8. TREAT: individualize and multimodal treatment approach is key!!! manage expectations away from being pain free + improve quality of life. 
		1. sleep hygiene most important..., regular less strenuous physical activity, stress manage, activity pacing 
		2. level 1A evidence with CBT!! coping skills + relaxation, distraction etc. but it's hard to speak to them about this - don't bring this up in the first visit bc of the sensitve subject  
		3. level 1 A evidence = best is a graded exercise program, **resistance training is huge, but adherence is a challenge, have to talk about it**
			1. acupuncture might work but not overwelming - remember - **this is NOT myofascial pain! therapies like chiropractic manipulation, massage, myofascial release can all make it worse.**
		4. should do **primary care setting management!!!!**
		5. MEDS: 3 approved meds: 
			1. SSRI: **duloxetine, milnacipran**
			2. and GABApentoids: pregabalin 

2. postherpetic neuralgia => herpes zoster - shingles 
	1. reactivation of **varicella zoster virus.... following primary chicken pox, VZV establishes latency in sensory ganglia of CNS**
		1. primary infection everywhere as chicken pox 
		2. virus wiggles into the dorsal root ganglia or CN ganglia lol 
	2. shingles is it reactivating + spreading from **single dorsal root or CN ganglia to corresponding dermatomes** - all the same virus, just diff points of time, dermatitis in a certain place. 
		1. stressor induced in life, later as adult usually, will travel from that ganglia into the skin!!!
		2. blistering rash = hallmark , **vesicular rash**
		3. less common manifestations - neuropathes, ophthalmic zoster, meningoencephalitis, transverse myelitis 
		4. decrease in epidermal nerve fiber density + atrophy of dorsal horn on affected side. 
		5. inc signalling thru ascending pain pathways, and decrease descending pain pathways. 
	3. super common! highest incidence, markedly inc with aging and immunocompromise 
	4. 15% = **chronic pain afterwards is NOT common!**
	5. prodrome 1 week before the rash starts like burning or stabbing pain, then the rash for 2-4 weeks
	6. after rash heals, we get subacute herpetic neuralgia and PHN !!! **greater than 3 months**
	7. subtype: primarily allodynia - **preserved sensation, relief w local anesthetics, extrme sensitivity**
		1. due to irritable peripheral nociceptors w/ inc input to SC 
	8. subtype: **continuous** pain: **sensory loss** 
		1. deafferentation and reorg of spinal cord 
	9. TREAT: pre



3. 
4. phantom limb pain
5. thalamic pain syndrome 
6.
