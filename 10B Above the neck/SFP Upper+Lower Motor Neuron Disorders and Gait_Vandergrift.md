brain -> stem -> SC -> peripheral nerves -> muscles 
upper motor neurons are 
- primary motor cortex neurons
- betz = geatest type 
- descending via the 
	1. internal capsule 
	2. thalamus 
	3. cerebral peduncle 
	4. midbrain/pons
	5. majority go thru decussation 
	6. lateral corticospinal tract
	7. ventral horn to alpha motor neuron 

ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord 
![[ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord.png]]
- betz cells = mainly in primary motor cortex
- largely crossing medulla LCST, and 10% uncrossed (anterior corticospinal tract) - they **still LATER cross at the ventral white matter at level of innervation though!**
- **glutamate is UMN -> LMN cell signal** happens in the SC **ventral horn**
- brainstem UMNs - corticobulbar fibers coordinate tone and posture.  nose wiggle and tongue etc. largely gonna be extrapyramidal tracts 
- cortical UMNs - coordinate the voluntary movement  - pyramidal system
- **basal ganglia + cerebellar UMNs don't synapse on LMN directly**

lower motor neuron 
- **alpha motor neuron = cell body in the spinal cord's dorsal horn**; cell bodies are CNS but axons will be part of somatic NS bc they extend
	- rexed lamina IX
- then it pairs with dorsal nerve root (separation of ventral and dorsal root is **denticulate ligament**
- will extend to **extrafusal(doing the work)/stirated/skeletal msucle fibers**
- efferent output to extrafusal msucle fibers 
- ACH from LMN -> muscle neurotransmitter 
- longest axons = sciatic nerve

gamma motor neurons would go into the **muscle spindles bc they'll shorten muscle spindles and stuff**

how does it go wrong? 
1. lumbar radiculopathy - herniated nucleus pulposis, hypertrophied medial facet ligament, disc-osteophyte complex, facet synovial joint cyst
	1. basically a **pinching nerve problem, maybe a bad disc will pinch a nerve**
	2. like L4/5 problem makes L5 nerve root symptoms 
	3. on the L1 S5 disk - sometime it can stick thru that meat into the spines... and you see a darker disc. 
	4. headaches, pain, numbness, weakness, fasciculations (rippling of muscle is seen)
	5. pinching that lower motor neuron 
	6. TREAT: with streroid shots and surgery worse case scenario
