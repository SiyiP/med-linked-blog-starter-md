brain -> stem -> SC -> peripheral nerves -> muscles 
upper motor neurons are 
- primary motor cortex neurons
- betz = geatest type 
- descending via the 
	1. internal capsule 
	2. thalamus 
	3. cerebral peduncle 
	4. midbrain/pons
	5. majority go thru decussation 
	6. lateral corticospinal tract
	7. ventral horn to alpha motor neuron 

ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord 
![[ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord.png]]
- betz cells = mainly in primary motor cortex
- ==largely crossing medulla LCST, and 10% uncrossed (anterior corticospinal tract) - they **still LATER cross at the ventral white matter at level of innervation though!**==
- **glutamate is UMN -> LMN cell signal** happens in the SC **ventral horn**
- brainstem UMNs - corticobulbar fibers coordinate tone and posture.  nose wiggle and tongue etc. largely gonna be extrapyramidal tracts 
- cortical UMNs - coordinate the voluntary movement  - pyramidal system
- **basal ganglia + cerebellar UMNs don't synapse on LMN directly**

lower motor neuron 
- **alpha motor neuron = cell body in the spinal cord's dorsal horn**; cell bodies are CNS but axons will be part of somatic NS bc they extend
	- rexed lamina IX
- then it pairs with dorsal nerve root (separation of ventral and dorsal root is **denticulate ligament**
- will extend to **extrafusal(doing the work)/stirated/skeletal msucle fibers**
- efferent output to extrafusal msucle fibers 
- ACH from LMN -> muscle neurotransmitter 
- longest axons = sciatic nerve

gamma motor neurons would go into the **muscle spindles bc they'll shorten muscle spindles and stuff**

how does it go wrong? 
1. lumbar radiculopathy - herniated nucleus pulposis, hypertrophied medial facet ligament, disc-osteophyte complex, facet synovial joint cyst
	1. basically a **pinching nerve problem, maybe a bad disc will pinch a nerve, pressure on it or a nerve root**
	2. like L4/5 problem makes L5 nerve root symptoms 
	3. on the L1 S5 disk - sometime it can stick thru that meat into the spines... and you see a darker disc. 
	4. headaches, pain, numbness, weakness, fasciculations (rippling of muscle is seen)
	5. pinching that lower motor neuron 
	6. TREAT: with streroid shots and surgery worse case scenario 
2. cervical myelopathy - pressure on the spinal **cord**; herniated cerv disc, bone spur, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, congenital stenosis 
	1. **upper motor neuron = babinski , clonus, fibrillations in EMG finding, spasticity, scissoring gait, inc tone** 
	2. C4/5 issue -> C5 problems 
	3. disc jutting into the spinal cord itself , a kink here seen clearly 
	4. TREAT: operation to put it back , and add a bone plug to keep some screws and stuff for bones to be reset. 
3. brain tumor 
	1. primary ones: 
	2. glioma  - glial cells 
	3. meningioma -  from meninges 
	4. secondary ones:
	5. lung cancer, breast, prstate, skin 
	6. we see weakness, inc tone, abnormal reflexes = upper motor neuron issues 
4. polio - viral infection of the **anterior horn cells
	1. wallerian degeneration of **lower motor neuron** = nerve lesion and antegrade degen of the axon from that. 
	2. weakness = atrophy but **sensation is intact!!!**
	3. on the image, some little spots there with the infections in the **spinal cord, ventral gray matter**
5. myasthenia gravis - autoimmune disorder
	1. antibodies attach nicotinic ACH receptors at neuromuscular junction 
	2. treat with the ACH-esterase inhibitors!!! 
	3. can't get aCH intot he muscls, so they get weak
	4. DX: **edrophonium/tensilon test** = reversible ACHesterase inbhitior, rapid onset and short duration, medicine pushing test. 
6. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS
	1. some are more truncal some are more bulbar-onset
	2. **mix of UMN and LMN** 
	3. voluntary muscls only 
	4. inc reflexes, babinski, spasticity 
	5. weakness atrophy fasciculations 
	6. 50% some cognitive dysfunction are seen 
	7. sporadic mostly and only 5-10% are inheritable
