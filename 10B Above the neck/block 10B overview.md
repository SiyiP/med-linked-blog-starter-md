#sensorimotor 
neurophys, neuroanatomy, neuropath/pathophys

carry most of this into 11
neuro tbl + practical + written only - > slips into final grade 
- tbl (based off pass labs - recall block 1 lol)

grade distribution 
neuro tbl hrr 10 pts
hrr practical = 25 pts 
- anatomy - going into deep dissection brain stems, etc. 
- brain lab = each treehouse goes in once ... **1 hr and a half** 
	- 1 = spinal cord + superficial brain structures
	- 2 = cranial n, cerebellum, brainstem, deep cortical structures
	- color copies of syllabus in lab. leave in the lab. 
written 92 points , 
total 127 pts 

CNS
- dev, anatomy, physiology(somatosensation+volu/invul motor systems)
- histo = **pass labs** , very important for the tbl ... the flipped sesh probably won't be done in the 2 hours. lesions in certain slides and know what the pathways and patho will be. 
- pathology 

HRR: PASS Atlas and SCBS Organization Module - do on your own time tbh. 
HRR: Neuro Exam practice workshop - work on some cases, practicing the neuro exam w/ intent to ID where the lesion is taking place , easy and low pressure ; 1.5 hrs per group 
- acoompanied by neuro + neuro attendings 
**tbl quiz is based off the pass labs 3-6... 5 q for sensory 5 for motor system**



general flex passlabs - under HRR as a theme - 
- focus on 10B 
- flipping for 1 and 2 as a review from last year's passlabs 
- **passlabs = are exam-testable(less bc of the tbl), they help out with understanding pathways too.**

Brainlabs - 
under HRR - there's **neuroanatomy supplemental videos - has detailed dissections illustrating the structures**
	watch these before your brainlabs!!!!
	she made modules, videos, super easy to get pins 
	- has syllabus "notes" before we go in, and **pre-lab modules , always do them!**
	- no dissections , don't touch at all - station styles are there, hold + rotate for identification. 
	- brains are in the cages. the cadavers we take out the brains in block 11 
	- self-guided pinning. 

brainlab 1 - laterla medial structures of brain + spinal cord 
- spinal cord - cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral 
- how are they diff? 
- why are some sections wider
- anterior and posterior side. 
- meninges + roots - dura, arachnoid, pia, denticulate ligs
- arrangement ? 
- BVs of spinal cord - **anterior v posterior spinal cord, is the middle spina blood vessel, ANTERIOR spinal artery from median fissure on the anterior surface.**
- lumbar cistern, clinical significance, with sampling CSF
- id 3 meninges of brain - see the dura 
	- arachnoid layer looks like seran wrap 
- occipital lobs + cerebellum
- falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli 
- id the lobes of brain, how are they delimited. dw about id-ing the opercula (foldings of lobes that make the lateral fissure)
- sulci lateral central interhemispheric
- gyrus and sulcus. 
- regions of the brain - corpus collosum 
- telecephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, pons, medulla , thalamus v hypothalamus 
- print out some unlabeled syllabus pictures!!!! - and practice labeling them on ur own. 
- commissures - how they communcate + fornix = septum pellucidum, fornix connection + septum separation 
- ventricles - CSF flow directors? 

next week - structures on ventral side of brain
- medulla, pons, cerebellum, midbain, diecephalon etc. 
- **cranial nerves!! (,:** - no deviation ,,, anomaly if they do. 
- rhomboid fossa - dorsal surfac of brainstem , under cerebllum 
- cranial n nuclei migrate to that dorsal surface, so we id some of those bumps 
subcortical nuclei - additional set of them with axial cuts (dorsal surface down 
cortical to spinal cord and stufff - these are hemisections 
after each lab, there's a subset left out **in buckets - make sure you be respectful + put them back**

during brain lab 2 = there's a fake practical/mock one - **she uses sutures or some smaller pins.**
- **every single one has a prompt - id the pin/suture structure etc... all 25 have a prompt**
