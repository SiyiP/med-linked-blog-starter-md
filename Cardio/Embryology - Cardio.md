hematopoiesis in 3 main extraembryonic mesodermal regions - begins in day 18-19 
- yolk sac
- connecting stalk 
- chorion 
New vessels from angioblasts = de novo = **vasculogenesis**
- Blood islands form in response to **FGF2 **
- initially formation of epithelia is via MET inside blood islands 
- **VEGF** makes epithelium 
- subsequently, we have angiogenesis rather than vasculogenesis since it's from existing vessels. 
- Ephrin-B2 -> arteries
- EphB4->veins
- Prox-1->lymphatics 
blood island angioblasts will make EMT epithelial to mesenchymal transformation from the epithelium of early vessel walls
Heart beats at day 22 / by week 4 of development 
- aorta forms 28 d 
- liver in blood cell formation 5-6 weeks 
- bone marrow blood cell making 6 months 

Aortic Arch Arteries - we will make 6 pairs of pharyngeal arches
each arch has arteries, muscles, nerves, skeletal structures
arteries of arches 4 and 6 = 
- distal part of right 6th arch regresses
- right 4th arch incorperated into right subclavian 
- L 4th arch = arch of aorta 
- left Arch 6 = part of left pulm a and ductus arteriosus 
- R Arch 6 = part of right pulm artery 
recurrent laryngeal nerve - diff on right and left due to differences in the 4th+6th arch dev 

cardiac looping - primary heart loops to establish L/R polarity in week 4 
- Defect in L/R dynein will lead to dextrocardia in Kartagener syndrome - Dextrocardia isÂ **a condition in which the heart is pointed toward the right side of the chest**. Normally, the heart points toward the left.
separation of chambers - ostium = opening, septum = walls 
[[Separation of Atria Chambers embryo.canvas|Separation of Atria Chambers embryo]]
1. septum primum grows to endocardial cushions, narrowing the ostium primum opening in the middle
2. ostium secundum forms in septum primum due to **cell death with ostium primum regressing.** 
3. septum secundum dev on right side of septum primum, and ostium secundum maintains R->L shunt
4. Septum secundum expands + covers most ostium secundum ; residual foramen = **foramen ovale**
5. Remaining portion of septum primum makes one way valve of foramen ovale. 
6. septum primum close against septum secundum, sealing foramen ovale soon post-birth bc of rising LA pressure and lowered RA pressure. 
7. Septum Secundum + septum primum fuse during infancy / early childhood, making atrial septum. 
patent foramen ovale - failure of septum primum + septum secundum to fuse after birth, seen in 25% of ppl and asymptomatic! 
- can lead to paradoxical emboli. 

ventrical making 
1. muscular interventricular septum forms with its opening the interventricular foramen 
2. aorticopulmonary septum rotates and fuses w/ muscular ventricular septum to form membranous interventricular septum, closing the foramen. 
3.
