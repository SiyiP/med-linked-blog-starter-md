preload - vol of blood in ventricles @ end of diastole - the end diastolic pressure 
- stretch of myocytes pre contraction... EDV + EDP and End diastolic walls stress
- FRANK-STARLING mechanism - more stretch = more output 
	- preload is normally supposed to increase to increase cardiac output... unless it doesnt and causes failure. 
	- Frank starling curve

increased in 
- hypervolemia
- regurgitation
- heart failure

Afterload - resistance left in ventricle must overcome to circulate blood - basically cardiac workload
- end systolic wall stress - systemic vascular resistance, diastolic aortic pressure 
- Law of LaPlace = Wall Stress = Wall tension / Wall Thickness.... 
	- basically work done is in line with oxygen consumption 
	- We see aortic stenosis and chronic untreated hypertension, seeing a very thickened wall. 
increased in 
- hypertension
- vasoconstriction

Stroke Volume = EDV-ESV
Ejection Fraction = EDV-ESV / EDV
Ejection Fraction = SV / EDV
Normal EF = .55-.80 
HFrEF = reduced EF <40 
HFpEF = >=50 eF

Heart Failure = we cannot deliver O2 at a good rate to the metabolizing tissues 
- failure to pump or failure to fill? 

Cardiac Remodeling
Eccentric Hypertrophy - preserved/mildy enhanced cardiac remodeling? from mitochondrial dysfuntion and cell death -> HFrEF 
Concentric Hypertrophy - compensated, preserved contractile function -> HFpEF
