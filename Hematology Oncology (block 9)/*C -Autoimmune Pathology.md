## Highlights for -SFP Autoimmune Diseases I+II_Baker Frost
Autoimmune differentials for raynauds:[^9]
- Limited scleroderma + mixed CT disease![^9]
- or: Adhd meds, vibrating tools etc, but we should look at nail folds caplliroscopy[^9]

Differentials for joint pain[^9]
- SLE without deformation[^9]
- RA with deformation[^9]
- If larger bones = think arthritis[^9]
- Men affected with seronegative + joint fusion[^9]
- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis fewer and larger bones affected[^9]
- Scleroderma too but it's more interested in calcium depots[^9]
---
Autoimmune dz = 5-8% of us population, mainly females[^9]
Single organ - hashimotos, pernicious anemia, good pasture's[^9]
Tolerance = unresponsiveness to antigen induced by previous exposure to that antigen.[^9]
- Self tolerance = just right, not too strong, not too weak binding = lack of responsiveness to self-antigens...[^9]
- Mechanisms of immune tolerance[^9]
	- Elimination of self reactive lymphocytes during development[^9]
	- Suppression by Treg or editing B cell receptors[^9]
	- Inibition by lymphocyte activation by inhibitory receptors like b7/[^9]
	- Death of self-reactive lymphocytes[^9]

Recall: tolerance breaking mutations:[^9]
- AIRE mutation => **autoimmune polyglandular syndrome** when your **==self antigen's dont' appear and get presented in the thymus==** , manifestations of several autoimmune dz[^9]
- FOXP3 = improper dev + activity of **Tregs** if mutated. -> ==IPEX== - immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, ==Xlinked XLAS==[^9]
- FAs/Fas L mutations -> **no proper apoptosis + you get a lot of representation of self lymphocytes** => ==autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome==[^9]

Genetic factors[^9]
- Familial clustering[^9]
- HLA linkage usually class II and recall penetrance is not 100%[^9]
- Induction of autoimmune dz in HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis[^9]+ mostly seronegative things 
Viral or bacterial infections[^9]
- EBV + SLE development leads to autoimmune tolerance[^9]
	- Microbe induces APC and is presented. if you have the self-t cell can exhibit response to both the self antigen + virus => causing autoimmunity[^9]
	- Molecular mimicry - microbe taken up and then the microbe antigen will look similar to the t cell!!![^9]
	- B cell and microbe binds to its receptor. then the b cell -> plasma cell, producing a cross reacting antibody => autoimmunity[^9]

ANAs - antinuclear antibodies, like autoantibodies made up of nucleus![^9]
- Homogenous = dsDNA with nucleosomes + histones = common with SLE[^9]
- Speckled => least specific, nuclear antigens to smith antigen (anti-smith antibody), ribonucleoproteins - RNPs = also seen with SLE; just "nonspecific" and possibly normal in older patients[^9]
- Centromeres inside the nucleus - think systemic sclerosis, mostly the limited version[^9]
- Nucleolar pattern = systemic sclerosis, the nonlimited version[^9]
- ![[anca patterns.png]][^9]

1. Systemic lupus erythematosus[^9]
	- ANA , Anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith[^9]
	- Drug induced = anti-histone antibody => translates to homogenous pattern[^9]
	- Acute or insidious as well, virtually involves every organ in body[^9]	- Pleuritic chest pain + photosensitivity[^9] - Seizures = the most frequent neurologic abnormalities in SLE, might have a cns vasculitis, microthrombi, small vessel vasculopathy, metabolic encephalopathy etc.[^9]
	- Young woman with butterfly rash - reddish area on cheeks + nose. fever , pain in joints *without* deformity.[^9]
	- We can follow the complement cascade too to check for FLAREUPs = C3 + 4 is low bc it's activated and being deposited in the organs if we have an active flare-up[^9]
		- deficiency in the CLASSICAL Complement pathway = C1a,C2,C4 deficient etc bc cannot clear out large insoluble immune complexes, which desposit into the joints
	- Uv light inducing widespread breaks in DNA, so release of this is a starting point of making immune complexes form, but they're dysfunctional or not able to act up right, staying deposited in the joints[^9]
	- Lupus nephritis = one of the highest concerns about this with protein creatinine + proteinuria[^9]

 2. Rheumatoid arthritis[^9]
	- Anti-CCP(more specific)+ RF[^9]
	- Joint fixed deformities; also can develop subcutaneous nodules on the forearm, which might improve[^9]

3. Seronegative spondyloarthropathies[^9]
	- Younger male[^9]
	- Umbrella term like juvenile idiopathic arthritis = several chronic inflammatory arthritis dz affecting the vertebral column[^9]
	- We get changes in ligamentous attachment to BONE rather than synovium (enthesitis) unlike RA[^9]; 	- Bony proliferation can lead to ankyloses[^9]
	- AntiCCP[^9]
	- Hallmark achilles tendon happens inflammation[^9]	- Inc risk of osteoporosis[^9], - Loss of lumbar lordosis, fusion of vertebral bodies and hunching[^9]
	- HLA-B27[^9]

		- Viral infection like chlamydia/GI bug[^9]
		- Urethritis/diarrhea pts get low back pain -> pain in ankles, knees, feet[^9]
		- Self-limiting but some might need longterm immunosuppressive help[^9]
4. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis[^9]- Umbrella[^9]
	- ESR up, poz ANA common, neg RF.[^9]
	- Symptoms for 6+ wks[^9]
	- Onset before 16 yo[^9]
	- Fewer + larger joints , systemic dz more frequent, RF + rheumatoid nodules absent.[^9]

	- Internal organs can be impacted too, vasculitis as well[^9]
	- Cavities/carries/tongue fissures. Inc lymphocytes in the salivary tissue in biopsies[^9]
	- Transplacental transmission -> passed onto the fetus, causing fetal *heartblock*!!! to ensure safe delivery + development[^9]
	1. Primary SS = sicca syndrome = isolated disorder[^9]
	2. Secondary SS = associated w/ another autoimmune dz like RA most commonly[^9]

6. Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)[^9]
	- Autoantibodies RNA POL III, centromere, Scl-70[^9]
	- 30-50 yr female... this WILL lead to fibrosis[^9]
	- Proliferative obliterative vasculopathy = basically BVs are gone. making more ischemia, fibrosis, inflammatory stuff that contributes to autoantibodies etc[^9]
		- Tightness[^9] + Telangiectasias,  Endothelial cell dysfunction, so you have shunting of blood into small blood vessels, and eventually get telangiectasias to occur[^9]
	- Raynaud[^9] Vasospasm[^9] White -> blue -> red.[^9]
	- Cold agglutinations might be indicated[^9]
	- Dysphagia/GERD(most ppl with the entire GI tract involved) + dyspnea, chronic cough, -> pulm fibrosis + pulm htn... also renal vascular dz[^9]

## Highlights for -SFP Amyloidosis_Pasham
Have good preventative measures but hard to remove[^10]
Extracellular depo of abnormal proteins, can be localized or systemic. classified based on protein identity.[^10]
DX: biopsy + then congo red staining[^10]
- Id the precursor protein - we need to type what we can do and suppress precursor protein[^10] **You must immunostain + tandem mass spectrometry**[^10]
- Abnormal glomerulus = we see amorphous pink hyaline material instead of a good amount of cellularity[^10]
	- Podocytes - can't do their jobs anymore, which is what causes the proteinuria[^10]
	- Congo red stain =apple green birefringence[^10]
	- Randomly arranged fibrils[^10]
- <3 shows waxy surface + expansion of interstitium, exactly like from the kidney into the heart. small bites[^10]

--- 
amyloidosis is due to excess production or mutant protein or defective proteolytic mechanisms ![^10]
- **Abnormal fibrils are resistant to macrophage destruction[^10]**
- Abnormally folded into beta pleated sheets->fibrils fold together-> which are very stable and which macrophages won't eat[^10]
- Biochemically very heterogenous! but morphologically homogenous[^10]
amyloidosis Nonspecific systemic symptoms[^10]
- Weakness, fatigue, weight loss[^10]
- Proteinuria -> nephrotic syndrome[^10]
- GI bleeds[^10]
- Neuropathy[^10]
- Hepatosplenomegaly[^10]
- Insidious CHF, arrhythmias, restrictive cardiomyopathy[^10]
types: 
1. Systemic amyloidosis[^10]: AL usually 
	- Plasma cell proliferations with amyloidosis - primary amyloidosis = AL fibrils with the immunoglobulin light chain; usually systemic leading[^10]
		- Most are ==AL bc they are amylogenic and misfolds , so most freq lambda==[^10]
	- Monoclonal processes; typically multiple myeloma associations; MGUS too or plasma cell neoplasm[^10]
	- Treat with SPEP or bone marrow biopsy most likely[^10]
	- specific for it: raccoon eyes ecchymoses x macroglossia x shoulder pad sign!!!![^10]
		- Periorbital purpura due to depo in small capillaries, causing bleeding around eyes[^10]
2. AA = reactive systemic amyloidosis[^10]
	-  ==Chronic inflammation -> macrophage activation -> IL1 and IL6 -> liver cells make more SAA==, serum amyloid associated protein (this is an acute phase response in inflammatory states)[^10]
	- Limited proteolysis of SAA will cause AA protein[^10]
	- **RA, CT disorders, IBS, chronic infections like TB[^10]**
	- We can fix just by giving more immunosuppression[^10]
3. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis - beta2-microglobulin[^10]
	- Dialysis membrane in the past, not now. the membrane wouldn't be calibrated so the beta 2 would accumulate from being retained in the blood, causing polyneuropathy[^10]
	- Put into the joints and synovial spaces.[^10]
4. Hereditary amyloidosis[^10]
	- Familial mediterranean fever - AA derived, mutant IL-1 causes all inflammation in the linings of your tissues[^10]
	- Familial amyloidotic neuropathies (several) - **transthyretin** - huge hereditary cause!!! has **ATTR as the fibril protein**[^10]
5. Age related: Systemic senile amyloidosis - **transthyretin** (transporter or hormone thyroxine T4) - huge hereditary cause!!! has **ATTR as the fibril protein**[^10]

Complement 
## Highlights for -HRR Disorders of Compliment_Pasham
- ![[complement pathway.png]][^11]
- Without an active one, you'd die[^11]
- Hyperactive ones get passed on[^11]
- Complement - many soluble proteins + membrane receptors, major ones C1-9[^11]
- A = aren't directly involved, they go Away and do neutrophil chemotaxis/anaphylaxis stuff[^11]
- B = larger Bind to the surface of bacteria[^11]
- 3 pathways that go and make the C3b convertase, which frees the C3b![^11]
- C3b will complex on surface of the pathogen[^11]
- C3b can be recognized by phagocytes + engulfed[^11]
- C3b can recruit MAC C5-9 to make a pore and lyse the microbe[^11]
- Recruitment and activation of leukocytes[^11]
- Classical pathway = immunoglobulin mediation[^11]
- Ig binds to antigens on the bacterial surface[^11]
- C1q complex will become activated, making C2 and C4 into their C2b + C4b[^11]
- C3b2b[^11]
- Inhibits large insoluble immune complexes + CLEARS THEM OUT[^11]
- Any deficiency in this is = SLE lupus[^11]
- Lectin pathway -[^11]
- Bind to exposed mannose + fucose residues on the bacterial or pathogen surface[^11]
- C2 + C4 -> C3 convertase (C3b2b)[^11]
- Alternative pathway[^11]
- C3b starts as the first step (spill over from the other pathways possibly during an infection or something)[^11]
- C3b attaches to bacterial surface , and then thru Factor B + D, it catalyzes into a slightly different C3 convertase (C3b with a b3)[^11]
- Solubilizes large insoluble immune complexes[^11]
- Deficiency in this causes pyogenic infections[^11]
- Terminal pathway; common MAC[^11]
- C3b will then attach back onto the C3 convertase -> C5 convertase[^11]
- 2 C3bs with a Bb[^11]
- Make C5 -> C5A and C5b(ready to make MAC)[^11]
- C6,7,8, and then C9 as a whole bunch of columns that makes a pore!!!! and things will leak out.[^11]
- Deficiency in this causes neisserial infections[^11]
- You can inhibit C5 with eculizumab[^11]
- Complement deficiencies[^11]
- Immune complexes need to be cleared out in the phagocytes of the liver + spleen etc, usually by classical pathway[^11]
- Parts of the classical pathway can be deficient, leading to these large immune complexes (C1q, C2/4 deficiency)[^11]
- Deposit of these complexes, leading to immune complex disease SLE lupus[^11]
- Alt pathway deficiency - if we don't have stabilizing factor of properdin(stabilizes C3bbb complex) + Factor D[^11]
- Deficiency in all pathways - C3 affected[^11]
- Pyogenic infections AND dense deposit disease[^11]
- C3 + C5 nephritic factors = autoantibodies that stabilize their respective C3/5 convertase.[^11]
- C3/5 will stay active forever, which means hyperactive complement system[^11]
- C3-mediated globmeruloneprhtis[^11]
- Deficiency in terminal pathways = C5-9 MAC components[^11]
- Inc susceptiblity to neisserial (gonococcal + meningococcal infections); intracellular mechanisms[^11]
- Dx by - measure C3 + C4, measured directly in nearly every biopsy[^11]
- To measure whole (C1-9) function = CH50 test = total hemolytic complement, ability of serum to lyse sheep RBCs sensitized with rabbit IgM that activates complement[^11]
- How to not attack SELF with the complement?[^11]
- Complement enzymes are zymogens[^11]
- Labile intermediates, especially reactive thioester active components don't last long[^11]
- Regulatory steps controlled by plasma proteins[^11]
- Attack of bystander host cells are prevented by inhibitory membrane proteins on them[^11]
- Complement inhibitor deficiencies[^11]
- C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) • HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA[^11]
- Rapid onset swelling in skin + mucosal tissues of upper resp tract - no hives + itching[^11]
- Swelling of larynx can kill you - asphyxiation[^11]
- Dental surgery = a common inducer, associated with trauma/allergen[^11]
- Overproduction of bradykinin, a vasodilator; bc this cascade is also inhibited by C1 INH bc it's a promiscuous one[^11]
- TREAT: essentially you replace C1 INH, give them fresh frozen plasma or C1 INH concentrate[^11]
- Factor I • - commonly have a mutation against this in atypical familial HUS!!! (Factor H, I, CD46)[^11]
- Factor H • - commonly have an autoantibody against this in[^11]
- Atypical acquired HUS!!! (Factor H, I, CD46)[^11]
- Mutation in age related macular degeneration, damage to eye![^11]
- Membrane-attack complex deficiencies •main thing is PIGA on the RBC which attaches these things![^11]
- Decay Acceleration Factor (DAF, CD55) • -> paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria stops GPI synthesis of DAF + CD59[^11]
- CD59 - MAC inhibitor - - paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria stops GPI synthesis of DAF + CD59[^11]
- Membrane Cofactor Protein (CD46) - mac inhibitor - commonly have a mutation against this in atypical familial HUS!!!(Factor H, I, CD46)[^11]
- Thrombic microangiopathies[^11]
- Mediated by platelet activation + endothelial cell injury[^11]

- Arteriole will get swollen + occluded with schistocytes that are stuffed inside the vessel[^11]
- Glomeruli has PINK bright things stuffed in[^11]
- Arterioles with gray mucoid things, and if it's chronic enough we see vascular remodding "onion skin"[^11]
- Hemolytic - microangiopathic hemolytic anemia[^11]
- Thrombocytopenia[^11]
- Uremia - acute renal failure[^11]
- "atypical HUS" = is more complement mediated!!!!![^11]
- And TTP can be acquired with genetic ADAMTS13, or acquired with ADAMTS13 deficiency[^11]
- Can be drug-mediated TMAS[^11]
- Atypical HUS: can be acquired or hereditary, reducing complement activation by the alt pathway[^11]
- Familial aHUS = disruption of *alt* pathway of complement system[^11]
- Associated with mutations of factor H, I and CD46!!! there's a genetic panel[^11]
- Acquired aHUS[^11]
- Most commonly, an autoantibody against complement factor H[^11]
- TREAT: eculizumab - monoclonal antibody acting against C5, preventing MAC[^11]
- You need meningococcal vaccine before treating; bc you're turning off your MAC!![^11]
- Secondary TMAs[^11]
- Scleroderma, SLE, malignant htn, pregnancy , transplant rejection[^11]
- CBC for TMAs[^11]
- Anemia, thrombocytopenia,[^11]
- Sr chem and creatine shows acute renal failure, high creatinine[^11]
- LDH inc bc of hemolysis[^11]
- Haptoglobin dec bc it binds freed hemoglobin[^11]
- Coag testing - normal, to distinguish against DIC[^11]
- Direct antiglobuin test = negative[^11]
- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobuinuria[^11]
- Complement induced hemolytic anemia[^11]
- Acquired - membrane defect, these cells are clonal, somatic mutation that affects myeloid stem cells[^11]
- Nocturnal bc our plasma get acidic at night, activating complement[^11]
- Wake up with bloody urine[^11]
- Anemia, thrombosis -> PROTHROMBOTIC bc the complement is activated, so you get portal and hepatic large vein blockage and death[^11]
- *acquire MDS myelodysplastic syndrome or AML acute myelogenous leukemia bc this is clonal!!! you get mutate more!![^11]
- Mutation in PIGA = will remove that GPI anchor in the myeloid stem cells (RBC's no longer have GPI anchor which are meant to attach CD55 + CD59)[^11]
- CD55 = DAF[^11]
- CD59 = inhibitor of MAC[^11]
- Pathological RBCs (not all of them, just this one subset coming from the clone that's mutated) don't have that PGI anchor that will stop the complement MAC from attacking them, the self instead, so they'll get lysed.[^11]
- TREAT: eculizumab treats it too - monoclonal antibody acting against C5, preventing MAC ... otherwise, give anticoag[^11]
- DX: flow cytometry - see which cells express both CD55 AND 59[^11]
- The pathological ones would have only one or none. (more to the left )[^11]
- Age related macular degeneration[^11]
- Dry = central geographic atropy[^11]
- Wet = neovascular or exudate[^11]
- Caused by aging, smoking, mutation ATP synthase gene, or mutations in FACTOR H[^11]
