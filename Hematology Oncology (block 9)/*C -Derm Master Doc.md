#summary
basic skin stuff 
- Cornified layers = topmost, stratum corneum, shedding basket weave dead keratin[^5]
	- Changes to this will never happen unless it's subacute or chronic[^5]
- Granular layer / granulosum = hyaline matured keratinocytes,[^5]
- Spinous layers - keratinocytes, all connected by desmosomes and hemi-desmosome spines[^5]
- Basal layer = where melanocytes live + Basal keratinocytes[^5]
- Undulating pattern to give strength: due to **rete pegs of the epidermis and then dermal papillae** which is upward projections of the dermis[^5]

Dermis - there's capillaries, and then melanophages[^5]
- Keratinocytes that are damaged, causing melanocytes to fall in dermis, and get eaten up - > manifest as HYPER/HYPOPIGMENTATION![^5]
- Solar elastosis - dermis blue gray color sun dmg[^5]
- Hair follicles and shafts - if it goes pretty deep down, they're terminal hairs[^5]
	- No hair follicles in palms + soles[^5]
	- If you see something kinda resembling one, know that it's bc of rubbing or something[^5]
- Hyperkeratosis - lots of keratin[^5]
	- We might see rashes that are SCALEY!!!![^5]
- Orthokeratosis - thicken cornified layer ***without*** retention of nuclei - loss of basket weave top layer[^5]
	- an example can be lichen related things, but with hyperorthokeratosis 
- Parakeratosis - basket weaves with ***retained*** nuclei , still cornified layer!!![^5]
	- dermatophytosis example 
- Acanthosis - thickening of epidermis, hyperplasia[^5]; usually flat 
- Acantholysis - lysis/disruption of intercellular keratinocyte adhesive junctions[^5]
- Papillomatosis - surface elevation , bumpy surface like warts caused by hyperplasia + enlargement of dermal papillae[^5]
- Spongiosis - intracellular edema - spines very prominent and visible - this is in very wet eruptions ![^5]
	- Normal spinous layers all disrupted[^5]
	- Inflammatory, neoplastic, an hereditary[^5]
- Dyskeratosis - abnormal, premature keratinization, cells very pink and small - basically weird and sworly strange histology[^5]
- Exocytosis - lymphocytes that migrate into epidermis[^5]
	- Paired with spongiosis often enough[^5]

Dermis[^5]
- Papillary dermis = the dermal papillae[^5]
- Reticular dermis = right below the papillary dermis, slightly darker and goes all the way down to the subq tissue. gives all the structure to it, protection[^5]
- Adnexal structures like hair follicle, eccrine gland + duct[^5]
- Keloid or hypertrophic scar = **dermal reparative reaction**, basically where layers of dermis + **ADNEXAL STRUCTURES GONE, all replaced by bubble gum pink collagen** [^5]
- Subcutis = subcutaneous tissue = **deepest layer inflammation is panniculitis**[^5]
- Fibroadipose tissues - deep to the dermis -[^5]
 
terminology/glossary:
Primary lesions - original lesion[^3]
- Macule, **flat** like a mole(<1.0 cm) =>>>> patch (1.0+)[^3]
- Papule, solid and firm, **raised**, dome shaped!!!! (<1.0 cm); and then plaque(1+ cm), But this is **raised flat top lesion**[^3]
- Vesicle- clear fluid filled (<1.0 cm) ->>> bullae (1+ cm)[^3]
- Nodule (>1.0 cm), very firm; epidermal/derma/SQ ; dome shaped->>> tumor (2+ cm), this is elevated/deep-seated or pedunculated[^3]
- blisters: Pustule - same like vesicle but neutrophil/pus-filled; raised, <1 cm[^3]
- Wheal = hive = urticaria = serous fluid coming out of blood vessels into the interstitium, causing swelling!![^3]
	- Variable blanching !!! bgd erethema[^3]; MAST. CELLs degranulation type 1 
	- erythematous, edematous plaques
	- pruritic, come and go = evanescent, episodes vary in itching 
	- TREAT: self-limited, antihistamines, leukotriene antag, immunosuppression 
	- **MICRO: invisible dermatosis - looks normal with maybe edema in dermis, perivasc inflammation + eo/neutrophils + stuffed dermal vessels**

Secondary lesions[^3] - What happens to the primary that you see[^3]
- Scale - laminated or plate-like keratin mass; dead epidermal cells that don't slough off.[^3] **THIS IS DUE TO abnormal keratinization; not dispersing + leaving as it should - hyperkeratosis**
- Crust- scab of dead cells + serum , like adding some fluid to the scale![^3]
- Erosion - loss of epidermis, no penetration of dermal epidermal junction meaning no scarring[^3]
- Ulceration - a deep ulcer loss of epidermis going thru Dermal epidermal junction = scarring![^3]
- Fissure = fine split/crack in skin[^3]
- Excoriation = focal shallow erosion with scale and crust sticking to it , like skin digging[^3]usually self inflicted 
- Scar = new CT that replaces lost substance in dermis or subq, inflammation replacement with scar tissue[^3]
- lichenification -  thickened rough skin due to repeat rubbing/scratching!!! = **acanthosis but big scale + hyperkeratosis** 

- Configuration[^3]
- Linear = poison ivy[^3]
- Annular = oval , granuloma annulare not uncommon on hands + feet[^3]
- Grouped = vesicles on a pink base think HSV[^3]
- Serpiginous - creeping/snakelike, cutaneous larva migrans on feet[^3]

pathology / dz: 

Papulosquamous dz = papules + scales , most common[^3]
1. Psoriasis (prototype)[^3]
	- Scalp/elbows, knees palms, soles[^3]
	- Symmetrical[^3]  
	- different types can be linear variety, guttate (dewdrops), inverse pattern, or erythrodermic where most of the body is red + scaley 
	- Very well-circumscribed borders[^3]; PINK plaques, *Silver* scale rather than greasy scale[^3]
	- Family hx, drug induced b-blocker/lithium, idiopathic[^3]
	- Nail pits, notches in nails + koebner phenomenon - new lesions appearing on healthy skin after injury or trauma[^3]
	- TREAT: topical/intralesional steroids, phototherapy, methotrexate
	- MICRO: **mound like *parakeratosis* with *neutrophil* microabscesses**
		- psoriasiform acanthosis - **meaning it's REGULAR with its undulations** - causing the plaque to form 
		-  diminished granular layer 
		- dilated, tortuous papillary dermal vessels
		- ![[psoriasis.png]]

	- Light/very brown, versatile, flat scale; scaley macuole[^3]
	- **Spaghetti + meatballs** in **stratum corneum** = both spores and hyphae!!! pitrysporum ovale.[^3]
		- recall - stratum corneum is the most superficial layer! the corn wheat things 
	- TREAT: topical selenium sulfide, imidazoles, etc. 
4. Secondary syphilis [^3]
	- Trunk/palms/soles[^3]
	- Non-pruritic[^3]

	- ![[eczema micro.png]]
- Ill defined borders[^3]
- Acute phase is oozey weepy -> use cream[^3]
- Later become dry + scaley (chronic) = use ointment[^3]
1. Contact derm: irritant vs allergic[^3]
	- Irritant = no memory t cells, you get the rash, then if you get exposed to same thing, no more rash like diaper stuff[^3]
		- **burning and pain! nonspecific inflammation, prior exposure not necessary**
	- Allergic = memory t cells like poison ivy, you get it again and again[^3]
		- **type 4 hypersensitivity**
	Noncontact derm: atopic(allergy-causing), nonatopic groups[^3]
	1. Atopic dermatitis = on face with sparing the center. eventually ends up on extremities[^3]
		- Children[^3]  
		- Hx of asthma, hay fever in pt or in family[^3] - **and leads to these too!!!**
		- due to defect in: ==keratinocyte barrier function + inc sensitivity to antigens-> sensitivity... variable age -> Th2 response==
		- **Dennie-morgan folds beneath eye**, **hyperlinear palms - extra lines** in the palms, or inc **IgE**[^3]
		- for subacute, we see **changes in the cornified layer like parakeratosis + sr crust, spongiosis, acanthosis, exocytosis of lymphocytes**

Vesiculobullous dz[^3] = blistering disorders!!!
**note: where is the split that causes the blister???** 
- subcorneal 
- suprabasal 
- subepidermal - expect it to be tense, entire roof is the epidermis, so it's pretty strong 
1. Erythema multiforme[^3]; entire body but usually acral + mucosas 
	1. GENERAL: erythematous, macules/papules/vesicles/bullae, **"targetoid lesions" - have a dusky or necrotic center!**

	- Major. =stevens-johnson syndrome = now with mucosal membranes, usually adults[^3]
		- secondary to drug usually 
		- micro: we see a huge white gap between dermis + epidermis due to necrosis = **no inflammatory rxn with band like infiltrate at dermoepidermal junction**
		- inc risk: polypharm, immunosuppressed, inpatients. 
		- fixed drug rxns - quickly get post-exposure, coming back at the same place -> progress to genitals 
			- **chemotherapy fixed rxns** - red painful hands + sweat gland inflammation; **flagellate like, someone whipped you and you see linearity on the skins**
		- DRESS rxns = **eosinophilia + end organ involvement going on**
	- TEN = toxic epidermal necrolysis **when SJS involves more than 30% of your body surface!**- like when you burn ur skin off, 50% mortality[^3]
		- - micro: we see a huge white gap between dermis + epidermis due to necrosis = **no inflammatory rxn with band like infiltrate at dermoepidermal junction**

	- older,5-6 decades
	- IgG autoantibodies desmoglein 1+3. **both IgG and C3 are net-like immunofloresence pattern**
	- huge **suprabasilar splits**,  with acantholysis , which causes this split - tombstones which are the kertinocytes in the split!;; 	- epidermis is lifted up, and then the white space in between is the blister
	- ![[pemphigus vulgaris.png]]
4. pemphigus foliaceus (autoimmune) = flaccid but with a **cornflake crust!!! very thin with exfoliation**
	- antibody IgG to desmoglein-1 , **rarely on any mucosa bc of this**
	- ==**subcorneal** split in the middle of epidermis top laye==r; more superficial with neutrophils + acantholytic cells
	- DIF: **intercellular net-like** igG + C3 more prominent superficially

	- - might take significantly more time to resolve post-resolution of inflammatory process 
	- Hyper/hypopigmented macules/patches -> uneven tone[^3] - > **melanophages eat the melanin**
	- MICRO:  **melanophages are in the dermis**
		- APCs will go into the lymph nodes, so they get swollen.

	- MICRO: nests and islands of basaloid cells with ==peripheral palisading(single layer of long cells)== set in fibromyxoid stroma with *==clefting==*[^7]
	- ![[basal cell carcinoma.png]][^7]

5. Merkel Cell carcinoma[^7]
	- Rapidly enlaging non -tender red violaceous nodules[^7]
	- ELDERLY[^7]
	- Looks small and discountable, but the worst of it all[^7]
	- Looks like a big blue block: sheets + ribbons of hyperchromatic cells with scant cytoplasm and smudged chromatins[^7]
	- Due to : merkel cell polyoma virus MCPV and UV exposure[^7]

Melanocytic proliferations[^7]
Melanocytic nevi[^7]
- Benign[^7]
- Melanocytes can make a nest - this is congenital or acquired in childhood - young adulthood, occuring anywhere skin and mucosa[^7]
1. Junctional nevus - when it's on the EDJ, flat and small[^7]
	- Compound nevus - both epidermal and dermal nests we see circumscribed small lesion + nests in dermis too[^7]
	- Intradermal nevus - when it's just in the dermis layer more PAPULAR!!! microscopically we see a raised papule with nests of melanocytes[^7]
	- Melanocytes = are from neural crest cells. look like nerves sometimes[^7]
	- MICRO: well circumscribed, we can see the nests so easily at tips and sides of rete or in the dermis!![^7]
	- Melanocytes get smaller and lose pigment as they break into smaller nests while they go deeper into the skin[^7]
2. Atypical melanocytic nevus[^7]
	- Larger, >5 mm, might be macule and or plaque, irregular borders , sporadic or inherited[^7]
	- No inc risk of turning into melanomas - just "funny looking nevi"[^7]
	- Plaque with irregular borders[^7]
	- A larger amt might mean more worry for family hx[^7]
	- Micro - *horizontally* oriented junctional nets with BRIDGING between rete[^7]
	- **Lamellar fibroplasia - we see extra pink looking stroma right under nest of melanocytes in the papillary dermis**[^7]
	- Overhang in rock climbing = junctional component extends beyond dermal[^7]
	- ![[atypical melanocytic nevus.png]][^7]
3. Blue nevus - an exception!! you can get them any time of your life[^7]
	- Heavily pigmented, blue black color, lots of pigment, **wedge-shaped** dermal proliferation of heavily pigmented **spindled** melanocytes[^7]
4.  Halo nevus - a dark dot. + hypopigmented lighter rim around it[^7]
	- Immune system making melanocytes regress around it[^7]
	- Benign *in* *children* but can also be harbinger of vitiligo[^7]
	- MICRO: huge amount of dense lymphocyte inflammation[^7]
5. Recurrent nevus - if they get a biopsy and don't remove the whole thing[^7]
6. Congenital nevus[^7]
7.  Spitz nevus - benign, are very very dark/erythematous - we see big heavily pigmented spindled EPITHELIOID MELANOCYTES IN VERTICAL nests[^7]
--
 8. **Malignant: melanoma[^7]**
	- Majority - de novo but some come within melanocytic nevi ; can be anywhere ![^7]
	- UV induced dmg + stepwise mutations build-up[^7]
	- Melanoma in situ - confined to epidermis, lacks metastatic potential[^7]
	- Prognosis associated with DEPTH[^7]
	- -"ugly duckling sign"- lesion looks different than the rest[^7]
	- TREAT: local wide excision. close clinical surveillence[^7]
		- Sentinel lymph node biopsy - put dye inside, then trace to whatever lymph nodes[^7]
		- Radiation[^7]
		- BRAF/CKIT(mucosal stuff) inhib[^7]
		- Immunotherapy[^7]
	- MICRO: abnormal or lack of functional nests, no circumscription[^7]
		- Melanocytes holding hands all across the basal layer, or they are extending into upper parts of epidermis = paget scatter[^7]
		- Lack of maturation in dermis, so they retain pigment, and nests don't get smaller with depth[^7]
	- ![[pagetoid scatter melanoma.png]][^7]
9. Spindle melanomas - can look like sarcomas or neurofibromas[^7]
10. Cutaneous metastases = in small parts of skin, all around, or regional lymph nodes, visceral organs like the brain where they might get hemorrhages[^7]
