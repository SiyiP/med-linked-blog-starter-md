#summary
basic skin stuff 
- Cornified layers = topmost, stratum corneum, shedding basket weave dead keratin[^5]
	- Changes to this will never happen unless it's subacute or chronic[^5]
- Granular layer / granulosum = hyaline matured keratinocytes,[^5]
- Spinous layers - keratinocytes, all connected by desmosomes and hemi-desmosome spines[^5]
- Basal layer = where melanocytes live + Basal keratinocytes[^5]
- Undulating pattern to give strength: due to **rete pegs of the epidermis and then dermal papillae** which is upward projections of the dermis[^5]

Dermis - there's capillaries, and then melanophages[^5]
- Keratinocytes that are damaged, causing melanocytes to fall in dermis, and get eaten up - > manifest as HYPER/HYPOPIGMENTATION![^5]
- Solar elastosis - dermis blue gray color sun dmg[^5]
- Hair follicles and shafts - if it goes pretty deep down, they're terminal hairs[^5]
	- No hair follicles in palms + soles[^5]
	- If you see something kinda resembling one, know that it's bc of rubbing or something[^5]
- Hyperkeratosis - lots of keratin[^5]
	- We might see rashes that are SCALEY!!!![^5]
- Orthokeratosis - thicken cornified layer ***without*** retention of nuclei - loss of basket weave top layer[^5]
- Parakeratosis - basket weaves with ***retained*** nuclei , still cornified layer!!![^5]
- Acanthosis - thickening of epidermis, hyperplasia[^5]
- Acantholysis - lysis/disruption of intercellular keratinocyte adhesive junctions[^5]
- Papillomatosis - surface elevation , bumpy surface like warts caused by hyperplasia + enlargement of dermal papillae[^5]
- Spongiosis - intracellular edema - spines very prominent and visible - this is in very wet eruptions ![^5]
	- Normal spinous layers all disrupted[^5]
	- Inflammatory, neoplastic, an hereditary[^5]
- Dyskeratosis - abnormal, premature keratinization, cells very pink and small - basically weird and sworly strange histology[^5]
- Exocytosis - lymphocytes that migrate into epidermis[^5]
	- Paired with spongiosis often enough[^5]

Dermis[^5]
- Papillary dermis = the dermal papillae[^5]
- Reticular dermis = right below the papillary dermis, slightly darker and goes all the way down to the subq tissue. gives all the structure to it, protection[^5]
- Adnexal structures like hair follicle, eccrine gland + duct[^5]
- Keloid or hypertrophic scar = **dermal reparative reaction**, basically where layers of dermis + **ADNEXAL STRUCTURES GONE, all replaced by bubble gum pink collagen** [^5]
- Subcutis = subcutaneous tissue = **deepest layer inflammation is panniculitis**[^5]
- Fibroadipose tissues - deep to the dermis -[^5]
 
terminology/glossary:
Primary lesions - original lesion[^3]
- Macule, **flat** like a mole(<1.0 cm) =>>>> patch (1.0+)[^3]
- Papule, solid and firm, **raised**, dome shaped!!!! (<1.0 cm); and then plaque(1+ cm), But this is **raised flat top lesion**[^3]
- Vesicle- clear fluid filled (<1.0 cm) ->>> bullae (1+ cm)[^3]
- Nodule (>1.0 cm), very firm; epidermal/derma/SQ ; dome shaped->>> tumor (2+ cm), this is elevated/deep-seated or pedunculated[^3]
- blisters: Pustule - same like vesicle but neutrophil/pus-filled; raised, <1 cm[^3]
- Wheal = hive = urticaria = serous fluid coming out of blood vessels into the interstitium, causing swelling!![^3]
	- Variable blanching !!! bgd erethema[^3]; MAST. CELLs degranulation type 1 
	- erythematous, edematous plaques
	- pruritic, come and go = evanescent, episodes vary in itching 
	- TREAT: self-limited, antihistamines, leukotriene antag, immunosuppression 
	- **MICRO: invisible dermatosis - looks normal with maybe edema in dermis, perivasc inflammation + eo/neutrophils + stuffed dermal vessels**

Secondary lesions[^3] - What happens to the primary that you see[^3]
- Scale - laminated or plate-like keratin mass; dead epidermal cells that don't slough off.[^3] **THIS IS DUE TO abnormal keratinization; not dispersing + leaving as it should - hyperkeratosis**
- Crust- scab of dead cells + serum , like adding some fluid to the scale![^3]
- Erosion - loss of epidermis, no penetration of dermal epidermal junction meaning no scarring[^3]
- Ulceration - a deep ulcer loss of epidermis going thru Dermal epidermal junction = scarring![^3]
- Fissure = fine split/crack in skin[^3]
- Excoriation = focal shallow erosion with scale and crust sticking to it , like skin digging[^3]usually self inflicted 
- Scar = new CT that replaces lost substance in dermis or subq, inflammation replacement with scar tissue[^3]
- lichenification -  thickened rough skin due to repeat rubbing/scratching!!! = **acanthosis but big scale + hyperkeratosis** 

- Configuration[^3]
- Linear = poison ivy[^3]
- Annular = oval , granuloma annulare not uncommon on hands + feet[^3]
- Grouped = vesicles on a pink base think HSV[^3]
- Serpiginous - creeping/snakelike, cutaneous larva migrans on feet[^3]

pathology / dz: 

Papulosquamous dz = papules + scales , most common[^3]
1. Psoriasis (prototype)[^3]
	- Scalp/elbows, knees palms, soles[^3]
	- Symmetrical[^3]

7. Pityriasis rosea  more history - driven+seasonal[^3]
	- Trunk/upper extremities[^3]

 Eczematous dermatitis[^3]
- Erythematous / red[^3] + very itchy 
- **defining histo = SPONGIOSIS**
	- acutely - normal cornified layers, spongiosis +/- **spongiotic vesicles(little white blister formed by edema by keratinocytes)**, exocytosis of lymphocytes, superficial perivascular inflammation 
	- ![[eczema micro.png]]
- Ill defined borders[^3]
- Acute phase is oozey weepy -> use cream[^3]
- Later become dry + scaley (chronic) = use ointment[^3]
1. Contact derm: irritant vs allergic[^3]
	- Irritant = no memory t cells, you get the rash, then if you get exposed to same thing, no more rash like diaper stuff[^3]
		- **burning and pain! nonspecific inflammation, prior exposure not necessary**
	- Allergic = memory t cells like poison ivy, you get it again and again[^3]
		- **type 4 hypersensitivity**
	Noncontact derm: atopic(allergy-causing), nonatopic groups[^3]
	1. Atopic dermatitis = on face with sparing the center. eventually ends up on extremities[^3]
		- Children[^3]
		- Hx of asthma, hay fever in pt or in family[^3] - **and leads to these too!!!**
		- due to defect in: ==keratinocyte barrier function + inc sensitivity to antigens-> sensitivity... variable age==
		- **Dennie-morgan folds beneath eye**, **hyperlinear palms - extra lines** in the palms, or inc **IgE**[^3]
		- for subacute, we see **changes in the cornified layer like parakeratosis + sr crust, spongiosis, acanthosis, exocytosis of lymphocytes**

	- Major. =stevens-johnson syndrome = now with mucosal membranes, usually adults[^3]
		- secondary to drug usually 
		- micro: we see a huge white gap between dermis + epidermis due to necrosis = **no inflammatory rxn with band like infiltrate at dermoepidermal junction**
		- inc risk: polypharm, immunosuppressed, inpatients. 
		- fixed drug rxns - quickly get post-exposure, coming back at the same place -> progress to genitals 
			- **chemotherapy fixed rxns** - red painful hands + sweat gland inflammation; **flagellate like, someone whipped you and you see linearity on the skins**
		- DRESS rxns = **eosinophilia + end organ involvement going on**
	- TEN = toxic epidermal necrolysis - like when you burn ur skin off, 50% mortality[^3]
		- - micro: we see a huge white gap between dermis + epidermis due to necrosis = **no inflammatory rxn with band like infiltrate at dermoepidermal junction**

Morbiliform eruptions - measle-like, penicillin like, little reddish flat things surrounded by normal skin[^3]
	- Neck, trunk, extermities - bilateral/symmetrical[^3]
	- Viral cause, and drug induced mainly[^3]
	- Onset in 1-2 wks, and then if re-exposed, 1-3 days[^3]

2. Vitilligo - face/trunk/extremities[^3]
	- Bilateral[^3]
	- Symmetrical[^3]
	- Depigmented macules/patches[^3]

3. Postinflammatory pigment alteration PIPA or postinflammatory hyper/hypopigmentation PIH[^3]
	- Anywhere, totally from hx of inflammatory event, skin trauma, acne, etc[^3]
	- Hyper/hypopigmented macules/patches -> uneven tone[^3]
