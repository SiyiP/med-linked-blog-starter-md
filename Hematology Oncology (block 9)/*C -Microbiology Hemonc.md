## Highlights for -HRR Zoonotic Bacterial and Viral Infections I_Krieg

Flaviviridae[^8] - (+ssRNA) spread by aedes mosquitos
- The human. = "dead-end host"[^8]
- Tropical/sub-tropical zones + feed in **daylight** hours[^8]
- TREATMENT for all flaviviridae: no antivirals, all symptomatic[^8]
Arthropod virus = arboviruses, all got 3 symptoms[^8]
- **Fevers** +/- maculopapular rash + benign[^8]
- **Encephalitis** , high case fatality rate[^8]
- **Hemorrhagic** fevers ; severe + fatal[^8]
 1. Dengue virus = a lot in florida. "breakbone fevers"[^8]
	- Acute phase 3-6 days post-infection = can get shock, bleeding[^8]
	- Severe ==muscle+joint pain for 2-10 days== w/ prolonged convalescence/ercovery[^8]
	- Rarely fatal + treatment symptomatic (:[^8]
	* *Type 1 first transmission* Dengue: mild febrile illness = antibody response and recovery[^8]
		After recovery, what can happen is ==dengue type 2 => basically antibody enhances infection==, some monocytes, ultimately inc. cytokines[^8]
		- ==DHF = dengue hemorrhagic fever[^8]==
		- Enhanced immune rxn bc of DEN1-4, antibodies beforehand. macrophage uptake the virus = worse disease.[^8]
		- **Hemorrhage + vascular leak** = petechiae, nosebleeds, gingival bleeds, purpura, gi = low platelets + hemoconcentration + neutropenia[^8]
		- ==**Low blood pressure = DENgue shock syndrome[^8]**==
2. Yellow fever virus[^8]

Blood borne Parasites

in malaria - Synchronized lysis of red blood cells by a new generation of merozoites is what causes the classic symptomatic paroxysms of malaria. 
The liver infection stage does not cause symptoms 
## Highlights for -HRR Blood Borne Parasites_Krieg
**Reproduction feeding form - trophozoite[^14]**
Protective/dormant form - cysts[^14]
Apicomplexa = sexual reproduction, life cycles, multiple hosts "BP to CT", ==babesia plasmodium==- all has different forms ring forms and stuff to see early trophs[^14]
- Plasmodium - 2 cycles[^14]
	- ==Asexual cycle - taking place in human[^14]==
	- ==Transferred in the form of oocysts -==> becomes sporozoites (cyst form hard to dz) -> ==merozoites in the blood (ring form, can be diagnosed thru its development to diff forms)== -> trophozoites -> **gametozoites** (goes back into mosquito when they bite into a person)[^14]
- ==Sexual life cycle - in the mosquito.[^14]==
P. Vivax(latam + india), ovale(africa), malariae(africa + asia), falciparum(africa + asia)[^14]
1. V==ivax. + ovale - they have periodicity==[^14]
	- RBC products phagocyzed by reticuloendothelial system =="black water fever" bc they have lyzed rbcs in urine==.[^14]
	- Fever periodicity - paroxicisms - 
		- ==this is a tertian fever. fever, pause, fever.[^14]==
2. ==Malariae + falciparum - **quartan fever, fever, pause pause, and fever**.== periodicity is rare in falciparum infections[^14]
	- Falciparum - infects rbcs of all ages[^14]
	- ==Alters cell membrane causing it to **adhere to endothelial cells, causing capillary congestion**==-> ==cerebral malaria in kids, pulm edema + renal failure==[^14] - very serious 
- ==Malariae attacks only senescent cells[^14]==
- See: seizures, coma, organ failure, anemia, splenomegaly, cerebral malaria ; paroxysm lasts hours - **cold, hot, wet stages[^14]**

- Disease takes 2-3 wks, but may be months if they take suppressant drugs...[^14]
- DX: parasitology thick and thin blood smears -
	- thick smear requires skilled observer 
	- thin one for species id[^14]
- ==Bloodwork - low hb, anemia[^14]==
- Rapid tests - ==paraSight F - detects HRP2 excreted by P falciparum[^14]==
- Optimal too - detects lactate dehydrogenase LDH + distinguish between p falciparum + vivax.[^14]
- ![[plasmodium ring forms and gametocyte.png|628x433]][^14] banana = p. falciparum in gametocyte form 
		ring forms = early trophozoites, of them all. 
- PROTECTIVE 
	- ==sickle cell trait of heterozygous HbS makes rbc less hospitable to falciparum -[^14]==
	- Thalassemias similar protection to sickle cell[^14]
	- ==Duffy antigens on rbcs - absent in many west africans, protective against vivax==[^14]
- Color queen chloroquine - All plasmodia except falciparum; Common resistances except caribbean, west panama and middle east[^14]
- Me fly queen mefloquine - For chloroquine resistant plasmodia; strong drug, **prophylactic**, one a week[^14]
- Atovaquone[^14]; 
	- ==Prophylactic, better tolerated, G6PD deficient NO "queen"[^14]==
- Primaquine - **P. vivax, P. ovale (targets liver stage)[**^14]
- ==Artemisinin - P. falciparium[^14]==

 Lyme dz, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rocky mt spotted fever(northeast), etc - all tick borne dz rising co infections happening - nantucket fever - babesiosis[^14]
- ==Babesia microti - deer tick, hemolytic anemia, fatigue, myalgia, fever[^14]==
	- NE america,[^14]
	- DX parasitized rbc on blood smear/pcr[^14]	- ==*maltese cross ring form*[^14]==
	- TREAT: azithromycin + atovaquone[^14]

		- ==Gametocytes replicate in mice, then will go into tick[^14]==
		- ==Ray bodies made in ticks[^14]==
		- Zygote sexual production -> ==kinetes which invade salivary glands of tick==[^14]
		- Multinucleated s==poroblast and sporozoites can go into humans== and invade rbcs, ==binary fission happens us to make merozoites and so on[^14]==
			- basically the human becomes the mouse 
	- in tenessee, we see the bulls eye and erythematous plaque with this appearance. 

- ==Southern-tick associate rash illness - this lone star tick== in the southern us - no test due to unknown agent, in tenessee![^14]
	- TREAT: topical glucocorticoids 2 wks, rash will resolve completely[^14]
	- In places where **lyme + STARI southern tick associated rash illness coexist, doxycycline can be used while ruling borrelia burgdorferi out[^14]**
	- These lone star ticks aren't vectors of lyme but are getting expanded.[^14]

the next few are very ==swirly worm-looking== things 
- Flagellated = asexual repro, binary fission "TTriGLycerides"[^14]
	- Trypanosoma cruzi - kissing bug -> ==chagas disease = has dot as head==[^14]
		- Bug bites, food contaminated with reduviid feces[^14]
		- Central/south am; leading cause of ==chronic heart dz==, ppl don't know they got it beforehand.[^14]
		- Only 1/3 of new infections are symptomatic but chronic infections are still scary[^14]
		- DX - blood smear in early, hard in chronic[^14]
		- Romaña sign(swelling of one eye), fever, cardiomyopathy, megacolon[^14]
			- look at the head-related symptom, we imagine a dot as this one's head 
		- **Host tissue cell about to burst and release, a ton of purple dots buildup[^14]**
- ![[Trypanosoma brucei and cruzi.png]][^14]
	- TREAT: benznidazole[^14]

	- Obligate intracellular parasites of macrophages[^14]
	- ==Disseminated infection of subq nodules up to 20 yrs in immunocompromised ppl[^14]==
	- Mucocutaneous - destructive ulcer of skin + mucous memb[^14]

- 2 cm filariae in blood collected at *==NIGHT==*[^14]
- - TREAT: ==diethylcarbazine==/DEC or doxycycline[^14]
- Pathogen - microfilariae/juvenile worms delivered by mosquito, which then migrate to lymph nodes, mature and then block these vessels to birth more, migrating to the blood[^14]
- ==Issue / symptoms - dead worms = inflammation and coarseness in vessels + skin[^14]==
- Note all the ==fibrous tissue and EGGS seen in the lymphatic vessels[==^14]
![[brugia malayi eggs micro.png|220x214]]

==Onchocera volvulus - **river blindness, black flies**== in equator climates worldwide[^14]
