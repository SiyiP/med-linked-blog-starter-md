## Highlights for -HRR Zoonotic Bacterial and Viral Infections I_Krieg

Flaviviridae[^8] - (+ssRNA) spread by aedes mosquitos
- The human. = "dead-end host"[^8]
- Tropical/sub-tropical zones + feed in **daylight** hours[^8]
- TREATMENT for all flaviviridae: no antivirals, all symptomatic[^8]
Arthropod virus = arboviruses, all got 3 symptoms[^8]
- **Fevers** +/- maculopapular rash + benign[^8]
- **Encephalitis** , high case fatality rate[^8]
- **Hemorrhagic** fevers ; severe + fatal[^8]
 1. Dengue virus = a lot in florida. "breakbone fevers"[^8]
	- Acute phase 3-6 days post-infection = can get shock, bleeding[^8]
	- Severe muscle+joint pain for 2-10 days w/ prolonged convalescence/ercovery[^8]
	- Rarely fatal + treatment symptomatic (:[^8]
	* *Type 1 first transmission* Dengue: mild febrile illness = antibody response and recovery[^8]
		After recovery, what can happen is dengue type 2 => basically antibody enhances infection, some monocytes, ultimately inc. cytokines[^8]
		- DHF = dengue hemorrhagic fever[^8]
		- Enhanced immune rxn bc of DEN1-4, antibodies beforehand. macrophage uptake the virus = worse disease.[^8]
		- **Hemorrhage + vascular leak** = petechiae, nosebleeds, gingival bleeds, purpura, gi = low platelets + hemoconcentration + neutropenia[^8]
		- **Low blood pressure = DENgue shock syndrome[^8]**
2. Yellow fever virus[^8]
	- We only detect the top 5% with symptoms like jaundice, fever, hemorrhage etc BUT 85% are asymptomatic contagious[^8]
	- Incubation 2-6 days in humans, 7-10 in mosquito[^8]
	- 2 phase illness[^8]
	1. 1-3 day = infection of liver, abrupt flu[^8]
		- Relative bradycardia = faget's sign(bradycardia + fever) => leukopenia + proteinuria[^8]
	 2. Remission day[^8]
	3. 4-10 = intoxication = fever, prostration, GI bleeding black vomit, delirium, JAUNDICE, petechiae, hypotension, shock[^8]
	4. 10 - 21 days = death or convalescence if survived[^8]
	- One vaccine dose = lifelong protection, give it 9+ months of age[^8]
3. Chikungunya virus[^8]
	- Acute onset of fever + *polyarthralgia*, joint symptoms bilateral/symmetric but severe and debilitating[^8]
	- **Cannot differentiate from dengue** unless we take these labs/PCR test: ==lymphopenia , thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, hepatic transaminases[==^8] - an extra focus on the **liver+kidney** it seems. 
	- Mortality is rare tho[^8]
4. Zika virus -[^8]
	- Asymptomatic/nonspecific fever w/ maculopapular rash, headache, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, rarely severe[^8]
	- Risk up for Guillain barre syndrome(ascending paralysis)[^8]
	- Congenital infection = severe = microcephaly, blindness, death[^8]
	- Sexual contact + blood transfusion[^8]

Arthropod bacterial[^8]
1. Yersinia pestis – "black death", g-neg staining[^8]

	- TREAT: gentamycin/streptomycin[^8]
	- YOPs = outer proteins of yersinia **inhibits phagocytosis = disarm of innate immune system with macrophage apoptosis**[^8]
		- **Type 3 secretion** = insertion of yops into phagocytes[^8]
		- **F1** = anti-phagocytic capsular protein[^8]
	- Bubonic vers - buboes = massively enlarged lymph nodes[^8]
	- Pneumonic version - airborne, infects the lungs -> pneumonic plague; dyspnea + nonproductive cough[^8]

Zoonotic viral infections transmitted by animal bites/body fluids[^8]
1. Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) –[^8]- Enveloped, filamentous, helical -ssRNA[^8]
