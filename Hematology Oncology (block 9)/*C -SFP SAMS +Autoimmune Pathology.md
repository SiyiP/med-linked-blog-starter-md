notes from SAMS
SFP skin pathology 

macule + papule = differentiated by palpability 
- and macule diffrentiate from patch by size 

erosion - loss of epidermis
ulcer - extends into dermis, heals with scar 

atopic dermatitis
lichen planus 
lupus erythematosis 
TEN = with antibiotic use, eruption -> flaccid bullae + large sloughing off of skin 

honey colored crust = impetigo, s aureus or s pyogenes

what skin manifestation does pseudomonas cause? 

morphea/scleroderma = fibrosing procss seen , lymphoplasmic dermal sclerosis + inflammatory infiltrate at dermal subq junction 

viral mediated = merkel cell carcinomas recall the MCPv 

HCV = lichen planus= hep c virus 
mycoplasma = erythema multiform
celiac dz = dermatitis herpetiformis 
HIV - crusted/norwegian scabies

autooimmune dz
RA = involves small joints of hands - invlving PIP+MCP ==but spares the DIP
- dip = distal interphalangeal joints, the tip top 
- proximal interphalangeal joints = the mid fingers 
- metacarpopholangeal joints = MCP, the base of the knucles 
![[nodal arthritis.png]]


psoriatic arthritis = "sausage digit of finger"
- knee pain and hell pain etc 
- ESR and CRP elevated, but negative RF
- also see nail changes.

![[microcytic anemias iron studies.png]]
microcytic anemia = with differentials 
- lower RBCs + inc RDW (RBC variety) + no basophilic stippling => iron deficiency anemia 
	- sr iron is dec, TIBC up, and ferritin down 
- ![[microcytic anemias CBC.png]]

hyperlobated neutrophil = megaloblastic anemia, so increased MCV 
![[megaloblastic anemia histo.png]]

folate correct anemia in B12 deficiency but cannot prevent neuro problems. 

schistocytes = seen with thrombotic micrangiopathies. + HUS 

alpha = the globin polypeptide chain that's synthesized thruout early fetal + adult life 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|A patient with CML who develops 10 – 19% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow is in accelerated phase.|   |

person with polycythemia rubra vera = typically have JAK2 mutation = ==look at more polycythemia vera pathology==

CD19+CD10+ poz = B cell ALL
B cell ALL do good in children 

t-cell lymphoblastic lympomas have immature t cells po for TdT, also poz for CD4+CD8 but neg for CD3 

|                                                                                           |     |

mantle cell lympoma = where Cyclin D1 is overexpressed bc of t(11;14); this is where we have CD5 poz CD23 neg b-lymphocytes which are SMALL

burkett lymphoma got a high Ki-67, meaning a high mitotic rate!!! - 

reed-sternberg cells are found in hodgkin lymphoma 
- these are large lymphocytes with more than one nuclus 
- aka "lacunar histiocytes" - these are giant clls, that make cytokines "popcorn cells"

hemolytic anemia in lupus is due to antibodies which is type 2 
but for renal dmg it's mediated by immune complexes, which is type 3 hypersensitivity 

ppl with sjogrens have a 40x risk of getting b-cell lymphoma 
scleroderma = renal dz associated with mucoid intimal thickening ., leading to thrombotic microangiopathy 

dermatomyositis = paraneoplastic, so search fo a malignancy. seen in pts with elevated CK, purple red rash on eyelids nad difficulty rising from chair 

polyarteritis nodosa - testicular pain, hep b, htn, mononeuritis multiplex, pancreatitis
- transmural necrotizing inflammation with pseudoaneurysm formations !!!!

kawasaki dz = think acute febrile illness, cervical lymph node enlargement, conjjunctivitis, oral erythema, and desquamative skin rash of hands
- with this focus on CAD , heart disease development in kids

GPA = should be treated aggressively, hemoptysis with nodular lung lesions, epistaxis, sinusitis, renal failure and C-ANCA etc... this is 80% mortality in 1 year 

microscopic polyangiitis = palpable purpura, hemoptysis, hematuria, actue renal failure and antibodies to MPO 


## Highlights for -SFP Autoimmune Diseases I+II_Baker Frost
Autoimmune differentials for raynauds:[^9]
- Limited scleroderma + mixed CT disease![^9]
- or: Adhd meds, vibrating tools etc, but we should look at nail folds caplliroscopy[^9]

Differentials for joint pain[^9]
- SLE without deformation[^9]
- RA with deformation[^9]
- If larger bones = think arthritis[^9]
- Men affected with seronegative + joint fusion[^9]
- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis fewer and larger bones affected[^9]
- Scleroderma too but it's more interested in calcium depots[^9]

non-inflammatory Arthritis 
- brief stiffness after rest (gel phenomenon)
- pain worsened w use 
- early - joint effusion (cold feeling in spite of effusion), then later we eventually get bony enlargement , replacement of joint with this bones - osteophytes. 
- loss of function 
- asymmetrical most likely 
- osteoarthritis =  "wear and tear" still there's a bit of inflammatory responses
	1. degenerative joint disease - DJD , **NONSYMMETRIC** destruction + regen of joints and bones - most common disability cause 
		- **cartilage fragmenting and narrowing w/ bony overgrowth afterwards** 
		- outer areas of it we see inflammatory mediators
		- crepitus sensation with movement 
- "nodal form" ![[nodal arthritis.png]]
	- DIPs = heberden nodes- tip of finger be4 nail, hard and this is bony overgrowth.  
	- PIPs = bouchard's nodes - one middle joint below the dip, hard and this is bony overgrowth.  
	- first CMC joint = base of thumb, can see squaring of the thumb base,  hard and this is bony overgrowth.  
- JSN = joint space narrowing, seen in bright white! JSN worsens and gets more narrow with time in asymmetric wear! and then we see **osteophyte outpocketing formation on the bone xray**

Gout - exquisitely painful/tender 
-  abrupt + acute, often at night, which is typically due to monosodium urate crystals precipitating from **colder** temps in synovial fluid -> **a lot leads to *tophi*, similar to calcionosis but different** 
	- these crystals will activate the TLRs, innate immune system, making **IL-1 beta**, which leads to inflammatory response in gout!!!
- 3-10 days episodic flare time 
- 75% first attacks in the first MTP joint ; red and swollen + sooo much pain ): 
-  monoarticular but can become poly and more frequent
- gout on XRAY: soft tissue swelling on edges + destruction on joint, ==**"RAT BITE erosion, like a bite mark with an overhang"**==, different from RA erosion 

psoriatic arthritis
- arthritis can precede rash in 20%  cases 
	- DIP joints, dactylitis (sausage digits uniform swelling + inflammation)/**enthesitis, where tendons and ligaments attach to bones,** 
	- oligoarthritis, but might present with rheumatoid presentation 
- pitting in nails 

arthritis temporal pattern 
- migratory = gonococcal arthritis, rheumatic fever
- episodic - gout, pseudogout, palendromic rheumatism 
quantitiative
- monoarticular - septic arthritis or gout 



---
Autoimmune dz = 5-8% of us population, mainly females[^9]
Single organ - hashimotos, pernicious anemia, good pasture's[^9]
Tolerance = unresponsiveness to antigen induced by previous exposure to that antigen.[^9]
- Self tolerance = just right, not too strong, not too weak binding = lack of responsiveness to self-antigens...[^9]
- Mechanisms of immune tolerance[^9]
	- Elimination of self reactive lymphocytes during development[^9]
	- Suppression by Treg or editing B cell receptors[^9]
	- Inibition by lymphocyte activation by inhibitory receptors like b7/[^9]
	- Death of self-reactive lymphocytes[^9]

Recall: tolerance breaking mutations:[^9]
- AIRE mutation => **autoimmune polyglandular syndrome** when your **==self antigen's dont' appear and get presented in the thymus==** , manifestations of several autoimmune dz[^9]
- FOXP3 = improper dev + activity of **Tregs** if mutated. -> ==IPEX== - immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, ==Xlinked XLAS==[^9]
- FAs/Fas L mutations -> **no proper apoptosis + you get a lot of representation of self lymphocytes** => ==autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome==[^9]

Genetic factors[^9]
- Familial clustering[^9]
- HLA linkage usually class II and recall penetrance is not 100%[^9]
- Induction of autoimmune dz in HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis[^9]+ mostly seronegative things 
Viral or bacterial infections[^9]
- EBV + SLE development leads to autoimmune tolerance[^9]
	- Microbe induces APC and is presented. if you have the self-t cell can exhibit response to both the self antigen + virus => causing autoimmunity[^9]
	- Molecular mimicry - microbe taken up and then the microbe antigen will look similar to the t cell!!![^9]
	- B cell and microbe binds to its receptor. then the b cell -> plasma cell, producing a cross reacting antibody => autoimmunity[^9]

ANAs - antinuclear antibodies, like autoantibodies made up of nucleus![^9]
- Homogenous = dsDNA with nucleosomes + histones = common with SLE[^9]
- Speckled => least specific, nuclear antigens to smith antigen (anti-smith antibody), ribonucleoproteins - RNPs = also seen with SLE; just "nonspecific" and possibly normal in older patients[^9]
- Centromeres inside the nucleus - think systemic sclerosis, mostly the limited version[^9]
- Nucleolar pattern = systemic sclerosis, the nonlimited version[^9]
- ![[anca patterns.png]][^9]

1. Systemic lupus erythematosus[^9]
	- ANA titer >1:80 as entry criteria (homogenous pattern), Anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith[^9]
		- like 1/2 patients have IgG/M that reacts with antiphospholipins like anticardiolipin, which gives a **false poz for syphillis**
	- Drug induced = anti-histone antibody => translates to homogenous pattern[^9]procainamide + hydralazine
		- non genetic other things might be - smoking, pollutants, stress, epigenetics, estrogen 
	- CAUSE can also be years of **lupus-specific autoantibody production or immune dysregulation before symptoms onset**
		- immune complex deposition (type 3 hypersensitvitiy)
		- antibodies against cells (type 2 hypersensitivity / autoantibody mediated)
		- **antiphospholipid syndrome** - venous + arterial thrombosis 
			- lupus anticoagulant - we see in vitro prolonging of clotting that is associated with hypercoag state!!! 
			- pulm embolisms are more common bc of this 
			- atherosclerosis is way higher too so CAD + MI is more high 
			- **libman-sacks endocarditis vegetations on the mitral valve is more common too!!!**
	- Acute or insidious as well, virtually involves every organ in body[^9]	- Pleuritic chest pain [^9] - Seizures = the most frequent neurologic abnormalities in SLE, might have a cns vasculitis, microthrombi, small vessel vasculopathy, metabolic encephalopathy etc.[^9]
		- many ppl have small joint pain like rheumatoid + myalgia + tendonitis , ==no erosions in xrays== 
		- basically serocitis = accumulation of fluid around organs is super common 
	- Young black woman with butterfly rash - reddish area on cheeks + nose. fever , pain in joints *without* fixed deformity.[^9]
		- typically women reproductive age, and family hx inc 14-20x risk factor. (incomplete penetrance even with HLA associations and inherited complement things)
		- common in black, asian, hispanic + indigenous ppl, esp in severity and higher incidence 
		- ==RASH: **spares the neolabial folds, which separates it from eczema**==
			- interface dermatitis - **immunoglobulin deposit along dermal epidermal junction + basal layer of epidermis degenerates**
			- discoid rash - scarring with chronic cutaneous SLE
			- gangrene of toes, secondary to **lupus vasculitis!!!**
	- We can follow the complement cascade too to check for FLAREUPs = C3 + 4 is low bc it's activated and being deposited in the organs if we have an active flare-up[^9]
		- deficiency in the CLASSICAL Complement pathway = C1a,C2,C4 deficient etc bc cannot clear out large insoluble immune complexes, which desposit into the joints
	pathways of getting it:
	- Cellular homeostasis related: Uv light inducing widespread breaks in DNA, so release of this is a starting point of making immune complexes form, but they're dysfunctional or not able to act up right, staying deposited in the joints[^9]
	- Innate immunity: TLRs + IFNs to viruses 
		- **upreg IFN inducible genes "IFN signature"**
	- adaptive immunity - b cell targets can be hyperproliferative and stuff 
	death caused by
		1. Infection 
		2. Renal failure(LN) - 	- Lupus nephritis = one of the highest concerns about this with protein creatinine + proteinuria "foamy urine" [^9]
			- more common in young AA males 
			- proliferative glomerulonephritis common 
			- see subepithelial (podocyte injury), subendothelial deposits, and immune expansion to basement membrane
			- classes of LN classification
				1. normal 
				2. mesangial proliferative, inc in mesangium, black immune complexes are in there and in the interglomerular cells
				3. focal proliferative<50%, inc BP, clots, both subepithelial (podocyte injury), ==subendothelial (WIRE LOOPS)== deposits, -> **segmental proliferative lesions show some karyorrhetic necrosis, shown by masson's stain showing the fibrin**
					- crecents are seen 
					- full house 
				4. diffuse proliferative, 50+% , even more worsening of symptoms as class 3 
				5. membranous - podocytes impacted with higher subepithelial deposits, leaky proteinuria even more, seen on **silver stain SPIKES on basement membrane!**
				6. diffuse sclerosing 90+% of glomeruli sclerotic and super scarred. 
		3. Cardiovascular disease  
		4. Diffuse central nervous system involvement
	- TREAT: hydroxychloroquine -antimalarial to target TLRs, innate immune system, to dampen it down!!!
		- also corticosteroids - **only as a bridge between other therapies at lowest effective dose**
		- remove environmental triggers 
		- screen bone diseases 
		- get vaccines bc immune compromise 

 3. Rheumatoid arthritis[^9]
	- Anti-CCP(more specific)+ RF[^9]
	- Joint fixed deformities; also can develop subcutaneous nodules on the forearm, which might improve[^9]
		- **we have erosions seen in xrays!** 
		- non-reducible deformities in later stages** bc erosions in synovial spaces took place 
		- Swelling of PIPs = looks like bouchards nodes, but **not the bony overgrowth ; they are squishy!!!**
	- Bilateral + polyarticular+ small joints[^9] + temporal additive pattern 
		- meaning 4+ joints ; excluding CMC joint and MTP joint (this is instead in gout + osteo)
		- **symmetric like SLE**
	- Inflammation in the synovium[^9] - much hypertrophy of these inflammatory cells eroding the bones 
	- Worse in the morning,[^9]
	- early DX: handshake/squeeze test at MCP (leads up to fingers) and then MTP joints (toes with foot bones) with squeeze  
	- eye inflammation + interstitial lung dz ; we see holes poking thru the sclera 
	- Inflammatory markers CRP + ESR are elevated[^9]

4. Seronegative spondyloarthropathies[^9]
	- Younger male[^9], - ankylosing spondylitis
		- morning BACK stiffness that loosens with activity 45+ min; this is diff from mechanical back pain that worsens with actiivty 
	- Umbrella term = several chronic inflammatory arthritis dz affecting the vertebral column[^9]
	- We get changes in ligamentous attachment to BONE rather than synovium (enthesitis) unlike RA[^9]; 	- Bony proliferation can lead to ankyloses[^9]
	- typically oligoarticular = <4 joints associated!!!
	- AntiCCP[^9]
	- Hallmark achilles tendon happens inflammation
		- DX: 
			- diminished ability to reverse lumbar lordosis = SCHOBER test +
			- inability to touch occiput to wall bc of sacroiliac joint + 
			- lumbar spines fusion +  **FABER** test, flexion, abduction, external hip rotation all cause pain. basically iliac compression causes this pain too  
			- bamboo spine = very hollow, str8, and joint space is fluffy overall, not as discrete on xray. 
	- HLA-B27[^9]
	- Eye inflammation too like anterior uvelitits.[^9]
	1. Reactive arthritis - within seronegative group[^9]
		- Conjunctivitis, urethritis, ==**asymmetric arthritis**==[^9]
		- Can't see, can't pee, can't climb a tree[^9]
		- Viral infection like chlamydia/GI bug[^9]
		- Urethritis/diarrhea pts get low back pain -> pain in ankles, knees, feet[^9]
			- rash sometimes ; **keratoderma blenorrhagicum, dry, scaly itchy rash on soles of feet!**
		- Self-limiting but some might need longterm immunosuppressive help[^9]

5. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis[^9]- Umbrella[^9]
	- ESR up, poz ANA common, neg RF.[^9]
	- Symptoms for 6+ wks[^9]
	- Onset before 16 yo[^9]
	- Fewer + larger joints , systemic dz more frequent, RF + rheumatoid nodules absent.[^9]
		- Oligoarticular JIA = most common! **asymmetric**(one joint involved) involvement of up to 4 joints like knee[^9]
		- Anterior uvelitis = eye inflammation!!![^9]

6. Sjogren syndrome[^9]
	- Anti-ro, anti-la[^9]
	- 50-60 older females[^9]
	- Rhuematoid arthritis .... **Dryness**[^9]
	- Cause MALT lymphomas, paraneoplastic[^9]
	- Internal organs can be impacted too, vasculitis as well[^9]
	- Cavities/carries/tongue fissures. Inc lymphocytes in the salivary tissue in biopsies[^9]
	- Transplacental transmission -> passed onto the fetus, causing fetal *heartblock*!!! to ensure safe delivery + development[^9]
	1. Primary SS = sicca syndrome = isolated disorder[^9]
	2. Secondary SS = associated w/ another autoimmune dz like RA most commonly[^9]

7. Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)[^9]
	- Autoantibodies RNA POL III, centromere, Scl-70[^9]
	- 30-50 yr female... this WILL lead to fibrosis[^9]
	- Proliferative obliterative vasculopathy = basically BVs are gone. making more ischemia, fibrosis, inflammatory stuff that contributes to autoantibodies etc[^9]
		- Tightness[^9] + Telangiectasias,  Endothelial cell dysfunction, so you have shunting of blood into small blood vessels, and eventually get telangiectasias to occur[^9]
	- Raynaud[^9] Vasospasm[^9] White -> blue -> red.[^9]
	- Cold agglutinations might be indicated[^9]
	- Dysphagia/GERD(most ppl with the entire GI tract involved) + dyspnea, chronic cough, -> pulm fibrosis + pulm htn... also renal vascular dz[^9]
	- Scleroderma renal crisis[^9]
		- Onion skinning of artery, no immune deposition bc not immune mediated![^9]
	1. Limited form scleroderma used to be called CREST syndrome[^9]
		- Anticentromere antibodies[^9]
		- C = calcionosis cutis; calcium buildup in the joints or any soft tissue of the body[^9]
		- Raynaud phenomenon[^9]
		- Esophageal hypo motility[^9]
		- Sclerodactyly[^9]
		- Telangiectasis[^9]
	2. Diffuse scleroderma = trunk and abdomen are affected Scl-70 antibodies[^9]

8. Inflammatory myopathies group term, there are different types[^9]
	- Dermatomyositis - most common in children isolated, inflammation of both skin + muscle.[^9]
		- Skin manifestations associated with interstitial lung dz[^9]
	- ==Paraneoplastic disorder in adults, see inc risk of visceral cancer - lung/ovary/stomach[^9]==
	- Heliotrope eyelids = purpleish color[^9]
	- ESR+, creatine kinase up AKA muscle breakdown!!!!, ANA+[^9]
	- Muscle biopsy gold standard[^9]
	1. Inclusion body myositis - MC inflammatory myopathy in pts 60+ yrs , older population[^9]
		- Vacuoles/holes in the muscle fibers, "rimmed vacuoles"[^9]
		- Large proximal muscles of shoulders/hips, like difficulty in rising from chair or climbing stairs[^9]
		- *insidious onset[^9]

9. Mixed Connective Tissue Disease[^9]
	- Overlapping[^9]; Synovitis of fingers, raynaud phenomenon, mild myositis[^9]
	- **Autoantibodies to RNP , anti-u1 RNP!!!!!!!!**[^9]

## Highlights for -SFP Amyloidosis_Pasham
Have good preventative measures but hard to remove[^10]
Extracellular depo of abnormal proteins, can be localized or systemic. classified based on protein identity.[^10]
DX: biopsy + then congo red staining[^10]
- Id the precursor protein - we need to type what we can do and suppress precursor protein[^10] **You must immunostain + tandem mass spectrometry**[^10]
- Abnormal glomerulus = we see amorphous pink hyaline material instead of a good amount of cellularity[^10]
	- Podocytes - can't do their jobs anymore, which is what causes the proteinuria[^10]
	- Congo red stain =apple green birefringence[^10]
	- Randomly arranged fibrils[^10]
- <3 shows waxy surface + expansion of interstitium, exactly like from the kidney into the heart. small bites[^10]

--- 
amyloidosis is due to excess production or mutant protein or defective proteolytic mechanisms ![^10]
- **Abnormal fibrils are resistant to macrophage destruction[^10]**
- Abnormally folded into beta pleated sheets->fibrils fold together-> which are very stable and which macrophages won't eat[^10]
- Biochemically very heterogenous! but morphologically homogenous[^10]
amyloidosis Nonspecific systemic symptoms[^10]
- Weakness, fatigue, weight loss[^10]
- Proteinuria -> nephrotic syndrome[^10]
- GI bleeds[^10]
- Neuropathy[^10]
- Hepatosplenomegaly[^10]
- Insidious CHF, arrhythmias, restrictive cardiomyopathy[^10]
types: 
1. Systemic amyloidosis[^10]: AL usually 
	- Plasma cell proliferations with amyloidosis - primary amyloidosis = AL fibrils with the immunoglobulin light chain; usually systemic leading[^10]
		- Most are ==AL bc they are amylogenic and misfolds , so most freq lambda==[^10]
	- Monoclonal processes; typically multiple myeloma associations; MGUS too or plasma cell neoplasm[^10]
	- Treat with SPEP or bone marrow biopsy most likely[^10]
	- specific for it: raccoon eyes ecchymoses x macroglossia x shoulder pad sign!!!![^10]
		- Periorbital purpura due to depo in small capillaries, causing bleeding around eyes[^10]
2. AA = reactive systemic amyloidosis[^10]
	-  ==Chronic inflammation -> macrophage activation -> IL1 and IL6 -> liver cells make more SAA==, serum amyloid associated protein (this is an acute phase response in inflammatory states)[^10]
	- Limited proteolysis of SAA will cause AA protein[^10]
	- **RA, CT disorders, IBS, chronic infections like TB[^10]**
	- We can fix just by giving more immunosuppression[^10]
3. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis - beta2-microglobulin[^10]
	- Dialysis membrane in the past, not now. the membrane wouldn't be calibrated so the beta 2 would accumulate from being retained in the blood, causing polyneuropathy[^10]
	- Put into the joints and synovial spaces.[^10]
4. Hereditary amyloidosis[^10]
	- Familial mediterranean fever - AA derived, mutant IL-1 causes all inflammation in the linings of your tissues[^10]
	- Familial amyloidotic neuropathies (several) - **transthyretin** - huge hereditary cause!!! has **ATTR as the fibril protein**[^10]
5. Age related: Systemic senile amyloidosis - **transthyretin** (transporter or hormone thyroxine T4) - huge hereditary cause!!! has **ATTR as the fibril protein**[^10]

 ## Highlights for -HRR Disorders of Compliment_Pasham
- ![[complement and inhibitors and deficiencies.png]]
- Without an active one, you'd die but Hyperactive ones get passed on[^11]
	- part A = aren't directly involved, they go Away and do neutrophil chemotaxis/anaphylaxis stuff[^11]
	- part B = larger Bind to the surface of bacteria[^11]
in terminal pathways:  
- C3b will complex on surface of the pathogen[^11]
- C3b can be recognized by phagocytes + engulfed[^11]
- C3b can recruit MAC C5-9 to make a pore and lyse the microbe[^11]
- Recruitment and activation of leukocytes[^11]
Classical pathway = immunoglobulin mediation[^11]
- Ig binds to antigens on the bacterial surface[^11]
- C1q complex will become activated, making C2 and C4 into their C2b + C4b[^11] = C3b2b[^11]
- **Classical pathway Inhibits large insoluble immune complexes + CLEARS THEM OUT[^11]**
	1. deficiency in complement's classical C1q, C2/4 etc, causes deposit of these complexes, leading to **immune complex disease SLE**

Lectin pathway -[^11]
- Bind to exposed mannose + fucose residues on the bacterial or pathogen surface[^11]
- C2 + C4 -> C3 convertase (C3b2b)[^11]

Alternative pathway[^11]
- C3b starts as the first step (**spill over** from the other pathways possibly during an infection or something)[^11]
	- C3b attaches to bacterial surface , and then thru **Factor B + D**, it catalyzes into a ==slightly different C3 convertase (C3b with a b3)[^11]==
- Solubilizes large insoluble immune complexes[^11]
2. **Deficiency in this causes pyogenic infections[^11]**

Terminal pathway; common MAC[^11]
- C3b will then attach back onto the C3 convertase -> C5 convertase[^11]...  2 C3bs with a Bb Make C5 -> C5A and C5b(ready to make MAC)[^11]
	- C6,7,8, and then C9 as a whole bunch of columns that makes a pore!!!! and things will leak out.[^11]
	3. **Deficiency in this causes neisserial infections[^11]** - like (gonococcal + meningococcal infections); intracellular mechanisms

4. **Overactivation** in ALL pathways mean = C3 affected!!!
- ==pyogenic infections AND **dense deposit disease== 
 
5. C3 + C5 nephritic factors can form, which **permits overactivation** = autoantibodies that stabilize their respective C3/5 convertase; C3/5 will **stay active forever, which means hyperactive complement system
	- will cause 5. ==C3-mediated globmeruloneprihtis== 

Diagnosis: 
- **measure C3 + C4, measured directly in nearly every biopsy**
- ==to measure **whole (C1-9)** function = CH50 test = total hemolytic complement, ability of serum to lyse sheep RBCs sensitized with rabbit IgM that activates complement== 

complement avoids attacking "self" by 
- being zymogens
- labile intermediates so active components don't last long 
- regulatory steps controlled by plasma proteins 
- attack of bystander host cells prevented by inhibitory membrane proteins on them. 

pathology heavy section:
1. hereditary angioedema
	- C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) deficiency
	- rapid onset swelling in skin + mucosal tissues of upper resp tract - **no hives + itching** - can kill via larynx swelling = asphyxiation 
	- dental surg = common inducer , induced by any trauma/allergen
	- **overproduction of bradykinin, a vasodilator**; bc this cascade is also inhibited by C1 INH bc it's a promiscuous one
	- fam hx, check C4, measure C1 
	- TREAT: C1 INH replacement with Frozen plasma or C1 INH concentrate 

Thrombic microangiopathies[^11] = hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), low platelets, and organ damage due to the formation of microscopic blood clots
- **Mediated by platelet activation + endothelial cell injury[^11]**
- caused by 
	- shiga-toxin mediated HUS
	- Atypical (complement mediated) HUS
	- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
	- Drug mediated
- ALL TMA LOOK THE SAME! in the tissues; Arteriole will get swollen + occluded with **schistocytes** that are stuffed inside the vessel[^11]
	- Glomeruli has PINK bright things stuffed in[^11]
	- Arterioles with gray mucoid things, and if it's chronic enough we see vascular ==remodding "onion skin"==[^11]
	Hemolytic - microangiopathic hemolytic anemia[^11]
	Thrombocytopenia[^11]
	Uremia - acute renal failure[^11]
1. atypical HUS = can be acquired or hereditary, **reducing complement inhibitors**[^11] -> **complement overactive!!!!!!**
	- TTP can be acquired with genetic ADAMTS13, or acquired with ADAMTS13 deficiency[^11]
	1. Familial aHUS = disruption of *alt* pathway of complement system[^11] - (Factor H, I, CD46)
		- **complement overactive from losing *factor H+I inhibitor and CD46***
		- ==Associated with mutations of factor H(**inhibitor** of **alt pathway+lectin)**, I (**Loss of this inhibitor of classical**) and CD46(**MAC inhibitor** **membrane cofactor protein**)/ !!! there's a genetic panel[^11]== 
	2. Acquired aHUS[^11] - (Factor H, I, CD46)
		- Most commonly, an *autoantibody* against **complement factor H** (inhibitor of alt pathway+lectin)
		- **complement overactive from losing factor H inhibitor**
	- TREAT: eculizumab - monoclonal antibody acting against C5, preventing MAC[^11]
		- ==You need meningococcal vaccine before treating; bc you're turning off your MAC!![^11]==
2. Secondary TMAs[^11]
	- Scleroderma, SLE, malignant htn, pregnancy , transplant rejection[^11]

CBC for GENERAL TMAs[^11]
- Anemia, thrombocytopenia,[^11]
- Sr chem and creatine shows acute renal failure, high creatinine[^11]
- **LDH inc bc of hemolysis[^11]**
- **Haptoglobin decreases bc it binds freed hemoglobin[^11]**
- Coag testing - normal, to distinguish against DIC[^11]
- Direct antiglobuin test = negative[^11]

3. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobuinuria: complement overactive. [^11] from losing PIGA or complement MAC inhibitors
	- Complement induced **hemolytic anemia**[^11]
		- Nocturnal bc our plasma get acidic at night, activating complement[^11]
		- Wake up with bloody urine[^11]
	- Acquired - membrane defect, these cells are clonal, somatic mutation that affects myeloid stem cells[^11]
		 - ==*acquire MDS myelodysplastic syndrome or AML acute myelogenous leukemia bc this is clonal!!! you get mutate more!![^11]==
	- Anemia, thrombosis -> ==**prothrombotic** bc the **complement is activated**==, so you get portal and hepatic large vein blockage and death[^11]
	- PIGA - protein that would make a GPI anchor onto the myeloid stem cells like RBC. 
		- ==if you have a mutation or loss of PIGA, you can't attach CD55 or CD59!!==
			- CD55 - meant to be a MAC inhibitor; AKA Decay Acceleration Factor =loss =  overactive complement 
			- CD59- inhibitor of MAC, loss of this too = overactive complement 
	- Pathological **RBCs** (not all of them, just this one subset coming from the clone that's mutated PIGA) **don't have that GPI anchor that will stop the complement MAC from attacking them**, so they'll get lysed.[^11]
	- TREAT: eculizumab treats it too - monoclonal antibody acting against C5, preventing MAC ... otherwise, give anticoag[^11]
	- **DX: flow cytometry - see which cells express both CD55 AND 59**[^11]
		- The pathological ones would have only one or none. (more to the left )[^11]

4. Age related macular degeneration[^11] = mutant in factor H, so overactive complement, from getting rid of factor H inhibitor 
	- Dry = central geographic atropy[^11]
	- Wet = neovascular or exudate[^11]
	- Caused by aging, smoking, mutation ATP synthase gene, or **autoantibody against FACTOR H (inhibitor of alt pathway+lectin)**, so it's lost. [^11]
	- Inc ROS + inflammation[^11]
	- TREAT: nutritional supplements - vita E, o3 fatty acids, lutein, zeaxantin.... supportive therapy only /:[^11]

## Highlights for -SFP Immune Vasculitis I+II_Pasham
steroid sparing agents = methotrexate, tocilizumab (anti-il6R monoclonal antibody )
Immune mediated vasculitis[^12];  For the most part - first line is TREATMENT: corticosteroids[^12]
Vasculitis - heterogenous grp of disorders based on blood vessel inflammation with necrosis[^12] ![[vasculitis size groups.png]][^12]
Large vessel vasculitis - think aorta[^12]
Chronic granulomatous arteritis, we'll see giant cells in all of these[^12]
1. Young , <50 = takayasu[^12]
	- Female, younger asian female>male[^12]
	- Pulseless dz = upper exremity claudication, you feel no pulse! + htn, carotidynia, dizziness, visual abnormalities[^12]
	- DX: angiography is good = conventional + MRI[^12]
	- We see characteristic narrowing of white on xray.[^12]
	- They have some continuation with vessel stenosis in spite of therapy ): might need some surgery ... otherwise good prognosis[^12]
2. 50+ in ppl with giant cell arteritis[^12]
	- We see large thickening of temporal arteries classically, also in vertebral arteries, opthalamic and posterior ciliary arteries[^12]; Thick cord temporal artery cord[^12]
	- Thickened intima on histo, and then we see giant cell = with elastin cords, eating up the elastica of the vessel![^12]
	- Insidious onset: perm blindness, fatigue, anorexia, fever, polymyalgia rheumatica - many areas of joint pain[^12]
		- ESR + CRP elevated[^12]
		- Anemia of chronic dz[^12]
	- Abrupt onset: headaches, unilateral, scalp tenderness,[^12]
		- Visually: diplopia, ptosis, transient or perm blindness, ischemic optic neuritis with pallor / edema of optic disk[^12]
		- Tongue hang or jaw claudition/hang[^12]
	- **Don**'t wait for the biopsy results just start steroids and don't delay treatment.[^12]
	- **Do well but treated cases remit in 1-2 years.[^12]**

Medium vessel vasculitis[^12]
1. Polyarteritis nodosa - necrotizing arteritis **without** Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome[^12]
	- Mainly male>female, peak age 50-60 yrs[^12]
	- Hep b association![^12]
	- Insidious onset[^12]
		- Nonspecific - weight loss, fever, arthralgias[^12]
		- Peripheral sensory neuropathy[^12]
	- Abrupt onset -[^12]
		- Palpable purpura, new onset htn with renal artery involvement - red patches with slight bump[^12]
		- Intestinal ischemia, abd pain + bloody in stool[^12]
		- Mononeuritis mutliplex - nerves not working,[^12]
		- This is classically a wrist drop! many nerves affected bc of vasculature, so the distribution of nerves aren't rlly making sense in terms of grouping[^12]
		- Livedo reticularis - beaming patterns, white and red microhemorrhage patterns, circles everywhere[^12]
		- Splinter hemorrhages + digital gangrene[^12]
	- Lungs are fine surprisingly; they're spared[^12]
	- **Necrotizing inflammation will extend thru the vessel wall -> HEAL INTO FIBROSIS -> into the perivascular tissue, inflammatory aneurysms develop[^12]**
	- We get **blood pouching out with the "healed part of the wall" = pseudo aneurysm** bc fibrotic tissue can't handle the pulsatile nature of blood[^12]
		- White circular thickening and strong random white dots of blood on the angiogram, beads.[^12]
	- DX: biopsy if skin involved, but target the organ while avoiding kidney biopsy[^12]
	- TREAT: death in 1-2 yrs, but prednisone 1 mg, and give pulse dose of iv pred if fulminant.[^12]
2. Kawasaki dz - necrotizing arteritis with MCLN syndrome[^12]
	- Mucocutaneous lymph node dz = meaning conjunctiva involved[^12]
		- Lymphadenopathy - we see some red inflammation around mouth mucous membrane[^12]
		- Also desquamation in it, came up in **desquamated rASH/peeling skin**[^12]
	- Self limited, but can cause **vasculitis of coronary a and lead to MI in a kid!**[^12]
	- TREAT: iv immunoglobulins + **aspirin to reduce CV sequelae bc of risk of CAD and M**I[^12]

Small vessel vasculitis[^12]
- All have the petechial hemorrhage dots picture, happening everywhere[^12]
- Palpable purpura/petechia = more associated in small vessel vasculitis! similar to polyarteritis nodosa[^12]

Anca associated: [^12] - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies[^12]
- Hyperactivate neutrophils, which then cause them to mediate a vasculitic attack to small capillarities[^12]
- Glomerulonephritis Bc of that attack on small capillaries!![^12]
- P-anca = perinuclear = MPO association[^12]
- C-ANCA = cytoplasmic, 90% is due to proteinase 3... PR3[^12]
- ![[p anca vs c anca.png]]
1. granulomatosis with polyangitis[^12]
	- - 30-50 yr old, male female 1:1[^12]
	- ==C-ANCA and PR3 poz in 85% of these cases![^12]==
	- - upper resp tract, "saddle nose" deformity!!![^12]
	- Tracheal stenosis, mass lesions that are invasive, so many ENT symptoms[^12];  Cavitary lesions (mimic TB)[^12]
	- Insidious until suddenly you get pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis[^12]
		- Unilateral one eye popping out possibly[^12]
	- - elastin highlights black part of vessel - shows discontinuity in elastin of the vessels[^12]
	- ==- granulomas + giant cells can form in GPA, diff from large cell vasculitises bc ANCA poz, renal involvement, and lower resp tract[^12]==
	- TREAT: high mortality ): initial immunosuppressive of prednisone, then cyclophosphamide or rituximab IV ;;; maintenance immunosuppression after achieving remission ;[^12]
	- pneumocystis carinii / jiroveci pneumonia prophalyxis bc of care to lungs![^12]
2. MPA - microscopic polyangiitis[^12]
	- - renal + lung heavy involvement!!!![^12] **Does NOT have upper resp tract involvement[^12]**
	- ==- P-ANCA is poz most of the time[^12]==
	- - necrotizing vasculitis in small vessels with little to no immune deposits [^12]
	- **- necrotizing glomerulonephritis + pulm capillaritis[^12]**
	- **- hyperacute = rapidly prog glomerulonephritis, pulm hemorrhage[^12]**
	- Insidious = intermittent constitutional symptms, purpura, mild renal + hemoptysis sometimes[^12]
		- SEGMENTAL necrosis = same crecsent as GPA[^12]
	- ==More HEMORRHAGIC PICTURE[^12]- there's No cavitary lesions nor are there a lot of giant cells ....[^12]==
- 3. eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EGPA[^12]
	- - insidious prodrome[^12]
	- - allergic prodrome , with ASTHMA adult onset!!![^12]
	- - eosinophilic pneumonia + gasteroenteritis[^12]
	- - ANCA+ MPO P anca mainly[^12]
	- There can be a neuro involvement with peripheral neuropathy[^12]
	- Vasculitis phase there's mainly a pulm dz, fleeting but lobar, interstitial, and nodular patterns on xray[^12]
	- **Pulm hemorrhage without renal dz[^12]**
		- - poor outcome with azotemia, CNS involvement, cardio , proteinuria + GI involvement unless treated[^12]


Non-anca-associated[^12]
1. IGA vasculitis[^12]
	- Palpable purpura in children, 50% less than 5 yrs ; slight bumpiness to it[^12]; there's IgA depo on histopath[^12]
	- **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis + arthritis + abd pain+ skin lesions[^12]**
		- IgA nephropathy and igA vasculitis look exactly the same. it's just that IgA vasculitis doesnt *HAVE* to involve the kidney[^12]
	- Better prognosis in kids, spontaneously resolves.[^12]
	- Adults and older kids, 10-30% go to chronic renal dz and end stage renal failure[^12]
2. Hypersensitivity vasculitis - small vessel cutaneous vasculitis[^12]
	- Serum sickness and drug rxns : fever, arthralgia, malaise[^12]
	- Distinguished by IgG deposition[^12]
	- Can also be in older ppl[^12]
	- **Abrupt onset of rash, arthus rxn or type 3 hypersensitivity, = immune complex mediated papular eruption more in dependent areas, discrete or coalescent lesions[^12]**
3. Behcet disease = outside the box, ulcerations + HLA-B51[^12]
	- Systemic vasculitis = involving vessels of all sizes on both arteries + venous sides; pulm + neuro has large morbidity[^12]
	- Pathergy - smallest trauma can result in abnormal ulcerations , similar to pyoderma gangrenosum[^12]
	- Freq seen in jp, ME, and mediterranean region[^12]
	- Usually young adults 20-40, men[^12]
	- **Oral + genital ulcers for years!!!!, Followed by ocular + neuro manifestations[^12]**

	- Hypopyon iritis = eye fill with pus[^12]
	- Involving all diff areas of body including arthritis, seizures, HA, GI[^12]
	- Relapsing + remitting course with more aggressive in men[^12]
4. Thromboangiitis obliterans -= buerger's disease[^12] - misc. 
	- Male smokers = age 25-50[^12]
	- HLA association[^12]
	- Vasculitis + thromobosis[^12]
	- MEDIUM vessels[^12]
	- Israel, jp, india[^12]
	- Raynaud's phenomenon, vascular insufficiency, pain , chronic ulcerations[^12]
	- Very intense vascular occlusions[^12]
	- Complete fibrinoid completely sealing off the vessel - autoamputation of finger tips![^12]
