porphyrin metabolism
![[Porphyrin input-output overview.png|506x245]]
under urine+feces = stercobulin (gives brown color)
succinyl coA + glycine -> delta aminolevulinic acid -> heme synthesis pathway 
![[heme synthesis overview.png|505x396]]
porphobilinogen =  pyrrole ring structure. then joining these together to make linear *tetrapyrrole* molecule 
- synthesis with ALA dehydrase joining 2 ALA , making 
	- Acetate + propionate sidechain
	- removal of Acetate with ammonia group happens later
protoporphyrin IX = basically heme molecule but *without* the Fe2 + in the middle, which is why ferrochelatase is needed next to make Heme
	i. ALA synthesis: the rate-limiting step - **joining succinyl coA TCA + glycine**; **inhibited by heme + hemin**
		hemin = oxidized form of heme, coordinated with **fe3**, an inactive hemin molecule in ferric iron form; and doesn't carry o2 
		- ILE, met, thr, valine makes succinyl coA 

hydroxymethylbilane - joining 4 porphobilinogens 
**when it turns to uroporphyrinogen III, we will flip the 2 sidehcains of the last ring to make it *asymmetrical***
when we make **coproporphyrinogen III, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase removes the carboxyl group off A sidechain -> M**

protoporphyrin IX synthesis = decarboxylation of side chains making P-> V for 2 structures. 
- making it conjugated and red: protoporphyrin IX!!!!!
- after it gets to protoporphyrin IX -> goes into the mt again!!!


deficiencies - porphyrias buildup of porphyrins due to partial def ... except for ala synthase. 
-  **light sensitive, blistering of skin, light reactive forms of these buildups, usually cyclic structures**
AIP - only without light sensitivity - porphobilinogen deaminase partial deficiency, Autosomal Dominant
- accumulation of ALA + porphobilinogen (potentiallly neurotoxic)
- mysterious and incapacitating attacks, but 90% of ppl with the genetic trait have no symptoms
- 5 ps...
	-  **Painful abdomen**, intractable;; many ppl end up with exploratory surgery ): 
		**- Port wine-colored urine  **
		- **Polyneuropathy** - nervous trembling
		- **Psychological disturbances** - altered consciousness, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
		- **Precipitated by drugs;** **fatal** with *barbiturates*, phenytoin, tranquilizers, *antipsychotics*, hypnotics
			- cyt P450 = rquires a lot of heme , so needing this needs heme dpletion. derepression of ala synthase reactivates this pathway 
			- this is **saved by HEMATIN = to help the people, repression of ALA synthase precursor protein will inhibit this, and reduces neurotoxic substances**

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: uroporphyrinogen III synthase - supposed to make the linear pre-tetrad cycle. 
- spontaneously we make **uroporphyrinogen I, where the sidechains are NOT asymmetrical!!! APAPAPAP = this is LIGHT reactive!!**
- we get blisters bc uroporphyrinogen I is made, ulcers and skin blisters, 
- RBC lysis due to ROS associated with light. 
- RED wine colored urine 

Porphyria cutanea tarda: uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase
- we can't make A-> M... accumulation of uroporphyrinogen III
- light sensitive. associated with hepC and alc use too 
- most common ; ppl don't often gt symptomes 
- mostly blistering due to light 
Lead poisoning : -ALA dehydrase
- **this is directly impacted upon lead toxicity, with the replacement of ZN cofactor in ALA dehydrase**
		- lead tox: hypochromic microcytic anemia - basopihlic stippling and stuff 
		- results in making ==zinc protoporphyrin==, which will end up on that site since ferrochelatase is inactvated 
		- kids get profound encephalopathic crisis bc they're still developing myelin. 

Hepatic jaundice: UDP-glucuronyltransferase
- breakdown of heme!!! 
- ![[heme breakdown and bilirubin.png|591x390]]
- bilirubin + albumin travels to hepatocytes, where liver takes up the bilirubin into the ER, solutizing it with UDP-glcUA, then makes it **conjugated via glucuronyl transferase**
	- if the UDP-glucuronyltransferase mutated, we have crigler najjar, which means we can't conjugate bilirubin 

regularly conjugated bilirubin exits wit **MRP2 across bile canaliculi!!!**, and then turns into UBG, urobilinogen ... whic is colorless
- some of this is reused, others gets oxidized into urobilins (yellow) or stays in large intstine making stercobilin of feces brown 

prehepatic jaundice = hemolysis usually 
hepatic jaundice = defect in transport(no MRP2 taking it across into bile canaliculi), lack of UDP-glucuronyl transferase(can't solubilize bilirubin, crigler-najjar, premature infant with immature liver), liver dysfunction in general 
- phototherapy treating 
posthepatic = biliary obstrution **like we see pale feces.**

nucleotide metabolism 
base = A/G/U/C
when it's a ribonucleoSIDE(just hte pentose none of the sugars)
- adenosine, guanosine, uridine, cytidine
when it has one phosphate group: AMP/GMP/UMP/CMP
overview -
- basically glutamine -> provides NH4+, and then bicarb, aspartate and PRPP all goes in to de novo synthesis 
- purines also need extra **N10fTHF** and glycine, they eventually make IMP ;; the PRPP is made onto the ring, ring constructed onto it 
	- IMP => ATP+GTP; adenine and guanine 
	- ATP -> gets broken into adenine, hypoxanthne and then xanthine
	- GTP gets into guanine and then xanthine at the end 
	- all purines bcome uric acid at the end of brkdown
- pyrimidines , all that PRPP gets added after the ring is made
	- pyrimidines are cytosine, uracil, thymine 
	- so bicarbonate + NH4 from glutamine => carbamoyl phosphate with **CPS-II**, making the ring while combining it all with **aspartate too**, with the help of the enzyme **ATCase**
		- CPS-II is a key regulated step in eukaryotes 
			- activation with PRPP and ATP 
			- deactivation with UTP/UDP/dUDP/CTP etc. 
			- **in S phase, for DNA synthesis, CPS-II becomes more sensitiv to activation and less so to inhibition.** opposite at end of S phase
				- this is due to phosphorylation of CPS-II by a map kinase 
		- with this step, you phosphorylate bicarb, then ammonia replacs the phosphate leaving grup, and then you have it phorphorylated again, putting the phosphate group on the othr side to make carbamoyl phosphate 
	- then you **close the ring** with **dihydroorotase**
	1. **complex = CAD = CPS2+ATCase+dihydroorotase**, which is a complex to turn bicarbonate + glutamine into cps-2, add aspartate for the ring, and then close the ring 
	- after you make the ring, you move stuff around with a mitochondrial enzyme **dihydroorotate dehydrogenase**, which takes electrons from it using NAD+ , making **orotate**
		- inhibited by leflunomide , which is a disease modifying antirheumatic drug DMARD= **targets t cell expansion**
	- the orotate gets added with a PRPP with **orotate phosphoribosyl transferase** -> making OMP !!!
		- OPRT!!! adds the pRPP to the pyrimidine ring orotate 
	- **orotidylate decarboxylase makes** UMP from OMP, 
		- ODC = this is a decarboxylation rxn, very efficienc 
	1. UMPs = complex of orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and orotidylate decarboxylase 
		1. basically OPRT+ODC
		2. **hereditary orotic aciduria is due to this UMPs deficincy**, treat with uridine ... **high lvls orotic acid, megaloblastic anemia, severe mental, pysical delays.**
	- UMP which can be turned into UDP by using **UMP kinase!!!!**
	- UDP can be turned into UTP via **nucleoside diphosphate kinase**
	- UTP turned into CTP via amination with **CTP synthase...** CTP can then be made to make RNA 
		-  then the CTP can be turned into dCTP for DNA
	- UTP via **methylation** or CTP via **amination....**
		- and as you know, that TMP is already on route to DNA 
	- TMP becomes thymine, then can be used to make b-amino-isobutyrrate, co2, nh4 
	- ctP into cytosine, then uracil, thn b-alanine, co2, nh4
	- and then utp made into uracil, then  b-alanine, co2, nh4

de novo synthesis happens in rapidly growing cells: cancerl cells + immune cells 

salvage pathway is adding activated ribose PRPP to an existing base. 

-
de novo purines 
we build the purine base with glutamine, N10formyl tetrahydrofolate (N10-fTHF) and glycine (remember that it's larger!!! )
1. PRPP, and then GPAT will take glutamine and then put the aminogroup on it and then make the phosphate groups leave. 
2. eventually after using up 5 aTP and 2 f-THFs on 5-phosphoribosyl 1-amine, we have inosinate, IMP. 
	1. adding GTP wth adenylosuccinate synthase makes adenylate AMP 
		1. addition of ASP, to make adenylosuccinate, and then fumarate leaves to make AMP 
	2. and adding ATP with IMP dehydrogenase + gmp synthase makes guanylate GMP 
		1. oxidize with nad+ on IMP dehydrogenase , making XMP xanthylate 
		2. then we would use GMP synthase to add another ammonia from glutamine to make GMP 
rest of it is on paper instead...

pentose phosphate pathway 
- hexose monophosphate stunt - feeds off glycolysis and ultimately re-enters 
- glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD is the rate limiting enzyme. most common enzymopathy. 
- pentose -> ribose 5 phosphate is the main product, made into prpp for nucleotides
phosphate is also generated in the form of nadph to get reducing powers!!!
- nadph = can be used for. biosynthesis of FA, steroids, cholesterol, deoxynuc, neurotransmitters, and also making **reduced glutathione to defend ROS**! also makes ROS for host defense :P
- ribose 5 phosphate = for synthesizing nuc acids like prpp and cofactors of ATP/NAD/FAD/ NADPH etc... 
	- also used to interconvert sugars to make atp 
NADPH >> than nadp+, so it's a reducing agent
NAD+>>>nadh, so it's an oxidizing agent 

upregulation in tissues that have steroid synthesis (adrenal, testes, ovary), fatty synthesis (liver, adipose, mammary gland)
- also phagocytes have the msot nadph !!!
- RBCs too = **they got no mt, so they rely on PPP for ALL of their NADPH... and they need to have glutathione on deck bc it's a ROS environment from o2.**

iron redox states.... we can have fe3+ methemoglobin with low affinity for o2...
- caused by deficiency of nadh methemoglobin reductase 
- also we have to maintain good reducing conditions with nadph bc of folding, we have misfolding if the sulfhydril groups make unintnended disulfide bonds
- heinz bodies = **if rbcs are under oxidative stress, these are denatured hb protein aggregates**
- bite cells occur as the spleen macrophages bite the rbcs to clear up the heinz bodis 

beutler fluorescent spot test = for deficincy of glucose 6p dh 

also with metabolism of acetaminophen - NAPQI detox'd by glutathione, but if there's not much, we can have toxicity of acetaminophen. 
- basically more and more with glucoroinidation are excreted, but then we have napqi toxic formation, but tis is detoxed. if it can't be detoxe, toxicity happens. 
- **treat acetaminophen overdose with n-acetyl cysteine** 

nadph oxidase = the multisubunit enzyme in phagocytes, to break up ros.
