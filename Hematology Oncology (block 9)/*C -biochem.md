porphyrin metabolism
![[Porphyrin input-output overview.png|506x245]]
under urine+feces = stercobulin (gives brown color)
succinyl coA + glycine -> delta aminolevulinic acid -> heme synthesis pathway 
![[heme synthesis overview.png|505x396]]
porphobilinogen =  pyrrole ring structure. then joining these together to make linear *tetrapyrrole* molecule 
- synthesis with ALA dehydrase joining 2 ALA , making 
	- Acetate + propionate sidechain
	- removal of Acetate with ammonia group happens later
protoporphyrin IX = basically heme molecule but *without* the Fe2 + in the middle, which is why ferrochelatase is needed next to make Heme
	i. ALA synthesis: the rate-limiting step - **joining succinyl coA TCA + glycine**; **inhibited by heme + hemin**
		hemin = oxidized form of heme, coordinated with **fe3**, an inactive hemin molecule in ferric iron form; and doesn't carry o2 
		- ILE, met, thr, valine makes succinyl coA 

hydroxymethylbilane - joining 4 porphobilinogens 
**when it turns to uroporphyrinogen III, we will flip the 2 sidehcains of the last ring to make it *asymmetrical***
when we make **coproporphyrinogen III, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase removes the carboxyl group off A sidechain -> M**

protoporphyrin IX synthesis = decarboxylation of side chains making P-> V for 2 structures. 
- making it conjugated and red: protoporphyrin IX!!!!!
- after it gets to protoporphyrin IX -> goes into the mt again!!!


deficiencies - porphyrias buildup of porphyrins due to partial def ... except for ala synthase. 
-  **light sensitive, blistering of skin, light reactive forms of these buildups, usually cyclic structures**
AIP - only without light sensitivity - porphobilinogen deaminase partial deficiency, Autosomal Dominant
- accumulation of ALA + porphobilinogen (potentiallly neurotoxic)
- mysterious and incapacitating attacks, but 90% of ppl with the genetic trait have no symptoms
- 5 ps...
	-  **Painful abdomen**, intractable;; many ppl end up with exploratory surgery ): 
		**- Port wine-colored urine  **
		- **Polyneuropathy** - nervous trembling
		- **Psychological disturbances** - altered consciousness, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
		- **Precipitated by drugs;** **fatal** with *barbiturates*, phenytoin, tranquilizers, *antipsychotics*, hypnotics
			- cyt P450 = rquires a lot of heme , so needing this needs heme dpletion. derepression of ala synthase reactivates this pathway 
			- this is **saved by HEMATIN = to help the people, repression of ALA synthase precursor protein will inhibit this, and reduces neurotoxic substances**

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: uroporphyrinogen III synthase - supposed to make the linear pre-tetrad cycle. 
- spontaneously we make **uroporphyrinogen I, where the sidechains are NOT asymmetrical!!! APAPAPAP = this is LIGHT reactive!!**
- we get blisters bc uroporphyrinogen I is made, ulcers and skin blisters, 
- RBC lysis due to ROS associated with light. 
- RED wine colored urine 

Porphyria cutanea tarda: uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase
- we can't make A-> M... accumulation of uroporphyrinogen III
- light sensitive. associated with hepC and alc use too 
- most common ; ppl don't often gt symptomes 
- mostly blistering due to light 
Lead poisoning : -ALA dehydrase
- **this is directly impacted upon lead toxicity, with the replacement of ZN cofactor in ALA dehydrase**
		- lead tox: hypochromic microcytic anemia - basopihlic stippling and stuff 
		- results in making ==zinc protoporphyrin==, which will end up on that site since ferrochelatase is inactvated 
		- kids get profound encephalopathic crisis bc they're still developing myelin. 

Hepatic jaundice: UDP-glucuronyltransferase
- breakdown of heme!!! 
- ![[heme breakdown and bilirubin.png|591x390]]
- bilirubin + albumin travels to hepatocytes, where liver takes up the bilirubin into the ER, solutizing it with UDP-glcUA, then makes it **conjugated via glucuronyl transferase**
	- if the UDP-glucuronyltransferase mutated, we have crigler najjar, which means we can't conjugate bilirubin 

regularly conjugated bilirubin exits wit **MRP2 across bile canaliculi!!!**, and then turns into UBG, urobilinogen ... whic is colorless
- some of this is reused, others gets oxidized into urobilins (yellow) or stays in large intstine making stercobilin of feces brown 

prehepatic jaundice = hemolysis usually 
hepatic jaundice = defect in transport(no MRP2 taking it across into bile canaliculi), lack of UDP-glucuronyl transferase(can't solubilize bilirubin, crigler-najjar, premature infant with immature liver), liver dysfunction in general 
- phototherapy treating 
posthepatic = biliary obstrution **like we see pale feces.**
