#pharm #summary 

L-asparaginase is a large immunogenic, tetrameric enzyme from _Escherichia coli_ that rapidly hydrolyses asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. It is primarily used for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). ALL and other leukemic cells tend to lack the enzyme asparagine synthase and require exogenous L-asparagine; depletion of serum L-asparagine by L-asparaginase results in leukemia cell death because they cannot synthesize new proteins due to lack of asparagine. After administration, serum concentrations of asparagine fall rapidly. While fairly effective and selective for some leukemic cells, it is not without risks and side effects, chief among them hypersensitivity reactions, including fever, rash and anaphylaxis, which can occur in 5-20% of pts. L-asparaginase does not have to enter cells.

Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha-specific therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that bind to TNF-alpha and neutralize its ability to bind to and activate endogenous TNF-alpha receptors.

, the big drug interaction you need to know for 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are drugs that inhibit xanthene oxidase, such as allopurinol and febuxostat.

## Highlights for -MMT Transfusion Medicine Squires
- Components - whole blood, rbcs, plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, granulocytes[^13]
- Derivatives - factor 8,9, etc etc... all come out of pharmacy[^13]
- Solution with citrate used to anticoagulate collected blood[^13]
Things we can do to make blood safer:[^13]
- Leukoreduction LR - remove wbcs from red cell/platelet products - makes you safe from CMV!!![^13]
- Irradiation - using rays or gamma - makes lymphocytes unable to proliferate, preventing GvHD in immunocomp patients![^13]

hemolysis sources; 
1. IgM - cold reacting - strongly reactive below 25 c, and not clinically significant[^13]
- Mainly causing intravascular hemolysis, complete obliteration bc strong complement[^13]
- Think of like **schistocytes**, which is microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and common with intravascular causes[^13]
- Real danger of the acute hemolytic transfusion rxn = kidney dmg or DIC[^13]
	- Associated with factor 12, basically activated by hemolysis, activation of bradykinin + coagulation cascade[^13]
- A great complement activator[^13]

2. IgG - best react at 37 degrees making them clinically significant + exposure to foreign rbcs make it arise - unexpected antibodies[^13]
- Extravascular hemolysis = think of ***spherocytes***, which is like autoimmune hemolytic anemia; milder symptoms[^13]
- Also there is removal via reticuloendothelial cells of spleen + liver - phagocytic cells take bites - **bite cells**[^13]

Rh antigen - if you have it you're Rh poz and if you don't it's neg.[^13]
Forward typing - to denote test down to determine this abo antigen on the surface[^13]
Reverse typing- confirmatry, looking for anti-A/B/whatever in their *plasma* - what antibodies do you have[^13]
Weak subgroups - there's multiple variants of A; there's A1 (strong, 80% of the population), and A2[^13]

Bombay phenotype[^13]
- Recall - first step of blood is to add **fucose**... to terminal galactose of precursor... this requires functional H gene... but if this is non functional, you have bombay's phenotype.[^13]
	- Bombay's is h/h instead of H/H , no H substance is made.[^13]
	- Clinically significant anti-A, anti-B and anti-H is made, causing hemolysis = can't get O blood![^13]
Rh null blood - no Rh antigens at all! no D antigen or anything else[^13]
-  Mild compensated hemolytic anemia, retiulocytosis, elevated bilirubin, stomatocytosis[^13]

Coombs reagent = solution of IgG antibodies, tiny little jobs. directed to FC of igG. can be clinically significant but can't agglutinate; allows crosslink from igG molecule on one RBC to IgG on another RBC[^13]

Platelets - all abo groups are acceptable for any pt. but women of childbearing age and younger wh are Rh neg receive Rh neg platelets[^13]
![[blood type transfusions.png]][^13]
 If the direct antiglobulin test is poz:[^13]
- Hemolytic transfusion rxn[^13]
- Hemolytic dz of fetus an newborn[^13]
- Autoimmune hemolysis[^13]
- Drug induced autoantibodies[^13]

Anemia - in transfusion it's when they're anemic but key is not compensated well like with symptoms of weakness/fatigue/dyspnea, tachy, etc. hb is a bad guideline for transfusion - never transfuse asymptomatic anemia.[^13]
- <6 hemoglobin = transfusion indicated.[^13]
- Active bleeding - might need transfusion - but the hb doesn't mean much, rely on clinical symptoms[^13]
- Reducing rbc transfusion need: anemia should be corrected pre surg[^13]
	- Normovolemic hemodilution - whole blood collected from pt at start of surgery and replaced with saline[^13]
	- Intraoperative blood salvage - blood lost can be collected, filtered and returned at the end[^13]
	- Trauma resuscitation - stop the lethal triad: hemodilution, acidosis, hypothermia[^13]
	- Specifically for trauma - RBC:Plasma:platelets in 1:1:1 ratio - all group O until known.[^13]

diseases needing transfusion: 
- Thalassemia - transfuse every 2-4 weeks, require chronic ones to prevent anemia and helping you replace the hb[^13]
- Sickle cell dz - SCD - point mutation on b globulin chain, distorting rbc, vaso occlusive; to relieve symptoms, inc o2 carrying, decrease blood viscosity[^13]
	- Complication with chronic transfusions - iron overload with tooo much[^13]
	- Iron Overload - issue in pts who are chronically transfused.[^13]
		- Symptoms - lethargy, fatigue, liver dmg, increased risk of diabetes, heart dz, arthritis[^13]
		- TREAT: chelation[^13]

platelet Apheresis (300 mL platelets and each is a full adult dose)[^13]
- <10k transfuse... <50k transfuse for invasive procedure[^13]
- Transfusion of 1 apheresis platelet to non-bleeding normal patient with norm spleen should increase platelet count from 30k to 40k[^13]
- We should make it go up by 1 gram!!![^13]
	- Or by 10k[^13]

- Refractory patients to platelets basically might not get any boosts at all.[^13]
	- Immune reasoning for that: HLA or platelet specific antibodies[^13]
	- We can give HLA-matched products, hla-a or hla-b that allows us to give[^13]
	- Cross matched platelet products, to determine any that might be compatible[^13]
- Plasma is used for active bleeding due to multiple coagulation factor deficiencies like liver dz[^13]
	- Rapid reversal of warfarin - but nowadays **prothrombin** complex concentrate is now recommended for this... or r**everse with IV vitamin** K[^13]

Cryoprecipitate - made from plasma frozen within 8 hrs of collection[^13]
- Has factor 8(not used to treat hemophilia A bc we already got factor 8 concentrate), 13, vWF, fibrinogen[^13]
- - to treat decreased or abnormal fibrinogen pts <100[^13]
- - some pts with vWD type 3 or type 2 who aren't responsive to DDAVP[^13]
- - rare pts with factor 13 def[^13]

Granulocyte transfusions - only for severely granulocytic pts who are septic+with no improvement[^13]

Bone marrow transplants- depend on ABO compatibility between pt and donor[^13]
Stem cells - ABO compatibility is not a barrier!!![^13]

1. Hemolytic dz of fetus + newborn HDFN due to ABO[^13]
	- Anemia / hyperbilirubinemia[^13]
	- Caused by IgG maternal[^13]
	- ABO HDFN - most of these cases[^13]
	- Most common mom group O (a ton of IgG anti A and B) and baby group A/B, where typeA/B have small amount of IgG antiA/b[^13]
	- Mild, bilirubin postnatally, affecting first and subsequent pregnancies[^13]
2. Immune antibody HDFN Rh or other antibody[^13]
	- Caused by stimulated/immune antibodies, 40%[^13]
	- Most commonly anti-D crosses over[^13]
	- Severe , later pregnancies[^13]
	- Prenatal - anemic, high output heart failure, edema, polyhydramnios - hydrops fetalis - babies can survive this with prenatal care. 98% survive[^13]
	- Postnatally - anemia still, hyperbilirubinemia due to hemolysis -> kernicterus[^13]
	- We give Rh-immune globulin RhIg - solution of antibodies to D antigen that *prevents* development of an anti-d antibody in Rh negative individuals[^13]
	- Something we do regardless to make sure she doesn't have this issue with future pregnancies on the case of a bleed.[^13]
	- After delivery, figure out if baby is Rh poz or neg. if Rh poz neonate, assess fetal maternal hemorrhage, and give RhIg basically[^13]
		- Rosette test of maternal hemorrhage - big or small? if small, one dose is ok, but if large, more needed[^13]
		- Kleihauer-betke test - how many doses of RhIG are necessary? the quantitative test that we look to the volume of fetal rbcs[^13]
	- Rh poz mom, screen poz or rh neg and screen poz, we would eval -> they already got an antibody[^13]
	- If IgG v IgM... then do a maternal titer if IgG antibody. higher titer, esp past 8 = more severe HDFN. more likely to cause fetal risk.[^13]
		- Fetal middle cerebal artery systolic blood flow velocity doppler[^13]

Non‐Infectious Transfusion Complications[^13]
- Allergic - most common adverse rxns - see hives/urticaria, weezing, angioedema, flushing.[^13]
	- Most commonly type 1[^13]
	- Some transfused plasma protein combines with pre-formed IgE antibody on surface of mast cells + basophils of recipient[^13]
	- Emergently - suspend transfusion, treat with antihistamine; prednisone alone, then restart transfusion if hives resolve[^13]
- Anaphylactic txf. rx. •[^13]
	- More srs with all the allergy symptoms plus severe hypotension/shock[^13]
	- Might cause this is deficiency in IgA - basically eventually if you give more and more IgA, they might make IgA antibodies...[^13]
	- We need to wash the platelets and the transfusion to remove all the IgA[^13]
	- Treat - stop transfusion and do not restart , supportive oxygenation, stabilize hypotension - crystalloids, epinephrine, dopamine if unresponsive[^13]
- Acute hemolytic transfusion. reaction. - within 24 hrs of transfusion, where **antibody is present**[^13]
	- Fevers + chills - pain , dyspnea, hypothension, hemoglobinemia,[^13]
	- Haptoglobin down bc that binds to free hb, ldh up[^13]
	- Pre-existing anti-a or anti-b of patient attached to the incompatibly transfused red cells... (anti A/B usually IgM, giving rise to complement mediated intravascular hemolysis -> "completely obliterated" bc complement is strong, we see schistocytes[^13]
		- Causing hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria on top of bilirubin going up[^13]
	- Stop transfusion, maintain venous access, infuse saline, maintain urine, bp, watch the pt. almost all of these are due to error.[^13]
- Delayed hemolytic txf. rx. - after 24 hrs alloantibody is not detectable at time of transfusion but develops later[^13]
	- Hardly any symptoms, unexpected anemia + jaundice.; inevitable and self-limited[^13]

 Respiratory Rxns[^13]
1. Transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI) -[^13]
	- Fever/chills + hypotension, central venous pressure, CVP normal to low[^13]
	- Antibody problem - this time, it's in the blood product, from the donor that are directed against recipient[^13]
	- TREAT: stop transfusion, prompt resp support, vasopressors for hypotension, ususlly helps in 5 days.[^13]
	- Minimizing use of donors with anti-leukocyte/HLA antibodies, like multiparous females[^13]
 2. Transfusion‐associated circulatory overload (TACO) •[^13]
	- Orthopnea, htn, CVP elevated - we overloaded this guy ![^13]
	- TREAT: stop transfusion, diuretics help, manage symptoms with support,[^13]

Miscellaneous[^13]
1. Febrile nonhemolytic txf. rx. - relatively common - no long term impact on pts[^13]
	- 1-2 degree rise in temp during or in 4 hrs of transfusion, +- the chill/rigors.[^13]
	- Wbcs and cytokines elevated in **donor blood**.[^13]
	- TREAT: antipyretics not aspirin/leukoreduction of blood product reduces risk of febrile rxns , basically reduce the platelets and red cells, cuts risk in half.[^13]
2. Graft versus host disease -[^13]
	- Very rare, only severely immunocomp patients like ppl with hodgkins, congenital immunodef, neonates, bone marrow transplant pts, etc.[^13]
	- Symptoms begin 7-10 days post transfusion; all die ): only thing we do is prevent it by irradiation if the patient needs it.[^13]
	- In an average pt with normal immune system - viable lymphocytes in any cellular product will be destroyed[^13]
	- But in immunocompromised pts, recognition of donor lymphocytes don't happen, so donor colonizes pts and proliferate.[^13]

Platelet‐associated reactions - both associated with thrombocytopenia, severe bleed risk, low platelet count, alloantibody dev to platelet specific antigens like HPA-1a aka GPIIIa[^13]
1.  Post transfusion purpura PTP - adults , sudden onset 5-10 days post transfusion, <10k, previous hx transfusion/pregnancy[^13]
	- Pts who are HPA-1a antigen negative.... any transfusion can lead to this development[^13]
	- Not only are these platelets destroyed but ALSO the patient's own; a bystander effect[^13]
	- TREAT: IVIg - HPA-1a neg platelets can be helpful in acute phase , but future ones should use rbcs and platelets known to be hpa-1a negative.[^13]
2. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia - fetal/neonatal, platelets <20k[^13]
	- Women neg for this antigen can develop this when fetus is hpa-1a poz and most are[^13]
	- Antibody crosses placenta and sensitizes fetal platelets, resulting in severe thrombocytopenia in fetus in first pregnancy.[^13]
	- TREAT: antenatal IVIg with or without steroids or intrauterine platelet transfusion with HPA-1a negative platelets[^13]

Infectious Complications[^13]
- Pathogen reduction = in platelet - new tech become available and further reduces this risk - basically we take the[^13]
- Take the blood, add psoralen reagant and then it gets into the DNA, then expose it to UV radiation, sticking it to all the dna and making it unable to replicate[^13]

anticoagulants I+II

problems to treat: 
abnormal coagulation - see **venous thrombosis DVT** - pretty common, basically venous valves are common - see **turgidity/low flow** , associated **pathology of platelet+RBC coagulation** , **red thrombsis**

arterial thrombosis - **irregularities on endothelial lining** - atherosclerotic **plaques** = foci for **platelet aggregation** = **white thrombis** = stroke + heart attack/MI = 
- there's **anti-platelets** of preventive measures. extra risk in prosthetic heart valves precipitating clots. also a-fib, and knee/hip replacement surgeries. 
SE: bleeding for all of them ;; used to prevent prothrombotic states, stroke, MI etc. 
antiplatelets - COX inhibitors, P2y12 antag, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, cAMP PDE inhibitors
- recall: platelets stick to subendothelial factors exposed by trauma .... including vWF and collagen.
	- **adhesion mediated by GPIa/IIa + GPIb**
		- GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors = stop this crosslinking of fibrin + platelets 
		1. ==eptifibatide== = use as iv infusion during percutaneous intervention/stenting, not used much just know MOA 
	- p2y1 and p2y12 = purogenic receptors that **ADP** binds to => **stimulates GPIIb/IIIa receptors** => binds to fibrinogen, causes platelet adherence to each other in **2ndary plug + stimulates COX1 = releases thromboxane A2 TXA2** to aggregate platelets. 
		- "xyz-GREL" **inhibits p2y12** = clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor
		- ADP binds to p2y12, then couples to Gi, **lowering cAMP**
		1. ==CLOPidogrel== = irreversible, progdrug needs CYP2c19 in liver... **some have polymorphisms**
			- might cause TTP + interacts with proton pump inhibitors 
		2. ==prasugrel== = everything same as ^ but more efficient, rapid, bleeding risk = **for patients in stents**
		3. ==ticagrelor== - **reversible inhibitor of P2Y12**; potent, but causes **dyspnea**
	- cAMP - **inhibitor of platelet activation**, lowered by Gi coupling with p2y12 and ADP. 
	- but cAMP PDE, will eat up and metabolize the cAMP - if you inhibit this, we would have less platelet activation and more blood flow. 
		1. ==dipyridamole - *inhibits* cAMP PDE==, **combined with asa to prevent ischemic stroke again**; helps you with peripheral artery dz + claudication! AE: headache 
		2. ==cilostazol== - inhibits cAMP, causing more vasodilation; but **CI for HF patients** . AE: headache 
	- COX1 stimulation also happens with collagen interaction with its receptor 
		- Ca2+ released from granules = cofactor for many proteases in coagulation cascade - linking platelet + coag phases to make poz feedback loop
		- PAR1/4 = protease activated receptors = GPCRs *activated by thrombin factor 2a/TXA2* in cascade... like Ca2+ , provides link between platelet + coagulation phases, making a poz feedback loop! = > **permenantly activated!
	- **inhibitor: PGI2** =  prostaglandin made by endothelial cells' COX2 to inhibit platelet aggregation 
- COX1 + 2 
	1. irreverisbly inhibited by ASA/==aspirin==! stops making of TXA2 which induces platelets! 
		- common to combine with another antiplatelet therapy : DAPT like p2y12 adp receptors, which are dual antiplatelet therapies 
		- GI upset tho with ulcers + blocking PGI2 in the gut from COX2 + REYE syndrome in kids 

coagulation phase 
- recall intrinsic system - contact exposure of vessels
- **extrinsic - tissue factor pathway , more dmg to tissue -> usually DIC** 
- PGI2 = made by COX2 in endothelial cells + stops platelet aggregation in opposition to TXA2 made by COX1 
- AT-III= anti-thrombin III, protease **inhibitor of many coagulation factors like thrombin (factor IIa) + factor 10**
	1. ==heparin sulfate== - usually on healthy vascular endothelial cells to enhance this binding of AT-III to coag factors; terminates clotting factors -> bleed easier to prevent thrombosis 
		- use against DVT, angina, MI, surgery to prevent thrombosis with coronary balloon/bypass 
		- rapid if unfractionated - **but can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia + RTA type 4** - monitor this with PTT!!! 
			- HIT = **antibodies against heparin in complex with platelet factor 4, released from a-granules during platelet aggregation, then we will activate and bind more platelets -> EXCESSIVE CLOTTING!**
			1. REVERSE AGENT: ==protamine sulfate== - binds tightly with it and neutralizes 
			2. REVERSE AGENT if acute thrombosis = ==argatroban==, a direct thrombin inhibitor + safely given IV! 
	2. ==enoxaparin== = low molecular weight heparin = better bioavailability + safer and more predictable, bc more selective for **Xa/10a inhibition than 2a/thrombin inhibition**
		- used as **bridge to oral anticoagulant like warfarin!**
	3. ==fondaparinux== = small, **has factor Xa only activity** - for pts going thru leg/hip/knee surgs, not for any big cardio surgeries 

Vitamin K = if reduced, gamma-carboxylates the coagulation factors 2, **7**, 9, 10 and proteins C + S to promote binding to vascular endothelium at sites of dmg
- vitamin. k epoxide reductase = reduces vitamin k 
	1. ==warfarin== - targets this enzyme, note that we still have to clear the fully prepped gamma-carboxylated factors in 4-5 days first, with ==enoxaparin== bridge therapy! monitor with PT bc it's an **extrinsic** pathway measure ; more than 2-3 INR = bleed risk, and less than that is clotting risk 
		- USE: prevent DVT/PE after heparin therapies , longer terms? 
		- interactions: food-drug, like inc of vitamin K decreases efficacy, and any disruption of intestinal flora(which makes K) like **antibiotics can inc warfarin efficacy = more GI bleeds**
		- **CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms can decrease warfarin clearance, inc bleed**
		- **polymorphism in vitamin K epoxide reductase = warfarin RESISTANCE** 
			- **we can get warfarin induced skin necrosis**
			- protein C = highest turnover, so if we reduce this too fast, we can get more clots bc it will come together with protein S to degrade 5a, causing more **small vessel microthrombosis in skin** 
			- CI: pregnant 

Factor 10a = the common place where the pathway comes together
1. inhibitor for this: Direct Acting Oral anticoagulant ==apiXAban==
	- CVT/PE + prophalaxis 
	- CI: in mechanical <3 valves and anti-phopsholipid syndrome 
	1. **reverse agent ==Andexanet alfa==** = DECOY for factor Xa!!! non functioning.. in case it bleeds too much, but you can most likely use prothrombin complex concentrate + TXA/EACA

thrombin = 2
1. inhibited by ==dabigatran== - this is a **direct thrombin inhibitor, higher bleed risk**
	- for acute VTE after heparin and also 2ndary strok prevention!!! and post-op stuff, but higher risk for BLEEDS + don't use in renal impairment 
	1. ==idarucizumab== reverse agent, mnoclonal antibody that will bind this free dabigatran 
2. ==Argatroban== - direct thrombin inhibitor as well, short halflife good for emergency HIT with acut thrombosis 

thrombolytics - "clot-busters, to dissolution of clot", reducing problems like **tissue injury, ischemia, etc**
tPA tissue plasminogen activator secreted by endothelial cells that bind fibrin + claves plasminogen to plasmin 
1. ==alteplase== - recombinant tPA, converts plasminogen -> plasmin!!!
	- fight PE/coornary thrombosis, **ischemic stroke especially**; no hemorrhagic ofc. 
	- AE: bleeding + angioedema
	1. antidotes = EACA; ==epsilon-aminocaproic acid/EACA== - which is antifibrinolytic drug
		- binds to plasminogen **competitively**, blocking site that plasminogen can bind to fibrin and its conversion 
	2. to a lesser extent, another antifibrinolytic drug is antidote ==**tranexamic acid, TXA**== which blocks lysine binding sites on plasminogen, preventing fibrin degradation 
		- binds to plasminogen

Antimalarials 
---
there's degrees of complicated v uncomplicated malaria 
some locally acquired malaria - most likely vivax. 
- drugs targetting asexual blood stages = to prevent/treat active dz 
severe malaria - **almost always falciparum!!!**
- hyperparasitemia, 3-5+% rbcs infected, cerebral malaria with coma, anemia, renal failure, resp failure, impaired conciousness, prostration, convulsions, acidosis, jaundice, pulm edema, shock - really sick pt
- DOC: **IV ==artemesinin + doxycycline==** immediately 
- monitor for parasitemia 
p. vivax + ovale - ==chloroquine + primaquine== = basically chloroquine as initial therapy, then prophylaxis of doses thruout, and then primaquine post-partum to rid those latent ones from the liver. 
p. malariae/knowlesi - sensitive to ==chloroquine== 
best prophalaxis = ==atovaquone + proguanil==

**heme is toxic to cells and parasites like malaria! it breaks the food vacuole and starves the cell to death**, so they try to convert it into hemozoin. 
- blocking conversion of free heme to hemozoin - 
1. ==chloroquine,== - global use decline bc of resistance, used for prophalaxis only in north of panama canal, middle east 
	- - PfCRT gene that will **be basis for resistance, by pumping out the drug in p. falciparum**
	1. combo with ==primaquine== against plasmodium vivax + ovale 
	- SE: GI, eye/ear stufff, **widened AT, QRS, seizure + *hemolysis in pts with G6PD deficiency*!!!**
2. ==quinine,==  for uncomplicated p. falciparum 
	- **2nd line** bc of AEs, like cinchonism - tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss, blurring of vision, diplopia, photophobia, confusion, headache, delirium, and decreased hearing to profound deafness
	- hypoglycemia + hypotension 
	- **TTP, blackwater fever!!! allergies + arrythmias**
3. ==mefloquine,== -  used for prophalaxis bc long half life of 13-24 days
	- AE: **neuro** symptoms, vivid dreams, psych/seizures 
4. ==lumefantrine==  - interferes with heme **polymerization in the food vacuole**
	- - highly effective in treating **noncomplicated malaria**, combined with ==ARTEMETHER==  in ART 
	- high half life 4-5 days administer with high fat meal
	- N/v, diarrhea + rash 

disrupt e-transport = atovaquone + prob primaquine
 1. ==primaquine== = moa unclear, ROS/ox damage!!! high activity against latent tissue forms / hypozoites of vivax/ovale = to **rid latent forms**
	- note: e-transport disruption potentially 
	- ***hemolytic anemia in g6pd deficiency bc of ROS dmg ?*** 

production of **free radicals** = ==artemisinin, artesunate, artemether== ; these have the **best efficacy + tolerability as potent and fast acting**
1. artemesinins in GENERAL
	- metabolized in food vacuole - make toxic free radicals!!!- heme iron made cleaves peroxide bridge in artemesinin structure! 
	- DOC: **against SEVERE malaria, all FALCIPARUM infections + against chloroquine resistant p. vavax**
	- short halflife, requires a **partner drug**:
	1. ==doxycycline== + ==artemesinin== = severe treatment
	2. ==artemether== and ==lumefantrine== - malaria common therapy 
	- pregnancy safe but avoid 1st trimester 

in the plasmodium, dihydrofolate reductase  DHFR will reduce DHF acid to THF, tetrahydrofolic acid, using the NADPH as an electron donor!! we metabolize the folic acid in this way 
- basically with the THF, it can be made into 5,10 methylene THF, which can go into making thymidine, as a cofactor that turns dUMP to TMP with the power of thymidylate synthase 
1. inhibition of DHFR - by **==proguanil==** - 
	- activity against primary liver stages + ***asexual* blood stages of falciparum + vivax** 
	- doesn't kill gametocytes but can block normal dev of oocytes in the mosquito gut 
	1. we combine this with ==atovaquone==, bc the resistance can happen super fast. = for **prophylaxis** + uncomplicated malaria 

note, in the ETC of the plasmodium, we have the ubiquinone aka coenzyme Q as an electron acceptor for the cytbc1 complex there 
1. ==atovaquone==  lipophilic analog of coenz q/ubiquinone. so inhibition of e-transport chain
	- active against the **erythrocytic and tissue trophozoites/shizonts of all plasmodium species**
	- right after the asexual stages basically 
	1. we combine this with ==proguanil==, bc the resistance can happen super fast. = for **prophylaxis** + uncomplicated malaria 

protein synthesis happens in the apicoplast (vestigial plastid, like chloroplast non-photosynthetic), basically chloroplast of the plasmodium, where ribosomes facilitate translation, similar to mitochondria
1. ==doxycycline==, 1st line in severe malarias like falciparum!!!! 
	- SE: photosensitivity, n/v, and don't give **children + CI in pregnancy**
	- combo with ==artemesinin==
2. clindamycin - inhibition of 50S ribosome unit on apicoblast... inhibiting it 
	- safer in pregnancy 

blood-borne- protozoal parasites 
leishmaniasis = parasite from a fly... cutaneous version is disfiguring and visceral form can be scary 
1. ==sodium stibogluconate== - can be cutaneous or visceral form, inject into cutaneous lesions first choice 
	- prodrug gets reduced to toxic Sb3+ species that kill amastigotes in the phagolysosomes, interfering with redox + loss of glutathione in the parasite 
	- SE: panceratitis, LFTs up, bone marrow suppressin, long qt 

Chagas/typanosoma disease of the kissing bug T. cruzi 
1. ==Nifurtimox== - making nitroradical anions. = cellular dmg! 
	-  n/v, myalgia, weakness , bone marrow suppression, peripheral neuropathy + gi 
2. ==benznidazole== -  making nitroradical anions. = cellular dmg!
	- better tolerated, but might see some urticarial dermatitis hives... manage with bone marrow suppression etc 

bloodborne helminths will replicate with microtubules polymerization... which will help cell division related to mitosis 
1. ==albendazoles== -  inhibit microtubule polymerization by binding b-tubulin and blocking division
	- good safety but just avoid 1st trimester + longterm stuff 
	- TARGET: **loa loa**

nematodes like **river blindness onchoceriasis + strongyloides too** have msucles that can move with Cl- channels
1. ==ivermectin== - tonic paralysis by activating the Cl- channel , causing **hyperpolarization and death via paralysis
2. good against **onchocerca!!!**

adult worms like lymphatic filariasis: brugia, wuchereria bancroft (lymphatic systems) and loa loa 
1. ==diethylcarbamanzine== - has unknown MOA , but good for things that are very disfiguring of lymphatic systems 
	1. _Wuchereria bancrofti_ and _Brugia sp_.

chemo agents; paper only?? - memorize for sketchy: 

kinase inhibitors sketchy

pharmacogenetics - importance - now NGS testing is non-negotiable before prescribing 

how small diff in gene products determine response - for more accurate dosing + new more targeted drugs + improved healthcare 
we use a normal distribution drug curve to choose the doses - high and low responders are tails of bell curve, ppl you need to worry about 
- monogenic. - due to allelic variation at one gene
- polygenic - due to 2+ genes
- polymorphic - frequently occuring monogenic variants at 1%+, like with SNPs, the maker of mnogenic variants  
	-  if the SNPs vary for drug metabolism/efficacy, freq distributions should be bimodal or multi modal

so **arrays of phase I + II metabolism genes** regulate pharm, like ADMET = absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity 
	Phase I: Yields a polar, water-soluble, metabolite that is often still **active**. Many of the products in this phase can also become substrates for phase II.
		- very common are p450s, 
		- and p4502D6 - which demehtylates prozac.... huge for SSRIs, targetting this 
			- if you dont't have this, prozac is active 
			- if you have this, this drug is inactive 
	Phase II: Yields a **large polar metabolite** by adding endogenous hydrophilic groups to form **water-soluble inactive compounds that can be *excreted* by the body.**
codeine - a pro-drug that needs metabolism to morphine via CYP2D6... 
- patients fall into 4 genetic subgroups and might have low levels of CYP2D6, which doesn't work 
- 6-mercaptopurine - azathioprine - toxic in small part of population bc monogenic inheritance of **thiopurine methyltransferase TMPT activity**
	- low activity = death 
	- dec activity = severe toxicity .... bc we need to use this to EXCRETE it 

 irinotecan - toxic effects in some patients = **UDP-glucuronosyltarnsferase 1A1 gene = the variant causes toxicity**
 - basically UDP-glucuronosyltarnsferase 1A1 gene adds glucuronoyl group, making it more excretible. and then the bacteria can take that off in your intestines and reabsorb it 

why are some gliomas resistant to nitrosurea alkylating agents
- anyting that alters promoter seq of NGMT methylguanine DNA methyl transferase 
- basically methylation of promoter region of ngmt might silence the genes. 

red and blonde ppl need more anesthesia - 
- red hair = associated with mutations on the **melanocortin-1 receptor gene MC1R** , used to be involved in melanogenesis
- loss of MC1R function - decrease in eumelanin 
- mc1r gene =  involved w complex neuromodulatory regulation in the CNS , so more anesthesia needed 

glutathione s-transferase - used to detox ROS ... but some ppl who have the D genotype have difficulty getting it gone 

KRAS G12C inhibitors in non small cell lung cancers 
-  it's 13% of NSCLC
-  - driver mutation = **kras is a GTPase, so constitutive activation of that leads to tumor proliferation**
- mechanism of adagrasib - to bind that KRAS G12C mutant protein which traps it in inactive state = only effective w this one mutation! 
---
immunomodulators 
focus on the targets and drill in what the real target of the drugs are .... focus on where they are! 
distinction - autoimmune vs autoinflammatory diseases
- for autoimmune dz + for autoinflammatory dz = we use immunomodulatory drugs
- causes - potentially self-reactive t lymphocytes to antigens that had been anatomically sequestered from immune system during dev; t clls treat these proteins as foreign antigens
	- like in immunoprivileged locations , ocular lens proteins -> uveitis , myelin basic proteins 0> MS, and spermatozoa -< aspermatogeneis 
- autoinflammatory - characterized by hyperactivity of the **innate immune system, not driven by autoantibodies, but by the cytokines**
	- like recurrent fever syndromes like familial mediterranean fever, tnf receptor periodic syndrome , crohn dz. 
	- transplantation = organ transplant or to treat gvhd 
	- oncology 

SE of immunosuppression = inc infection + malignnat neoplasms due to loss of immune surveillance + stimulating rapid stem cell prolifration which restore the immune system 

![[immunomodulary targets.png]]
- calcineurin = downstream of t cell receptor that removes phosphate group from NFAT-P, which will enter the nucleus and drive immune-stimulating genes
- affecting IL-2R signalling, and drives down lymphocyte prolieration 
- inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase, which is something to sethetize purine bases 
- azithioprine -> 6MP, supprssing PRPP amidotransferase 

true immunosuppressant drugs = for transplantations 
and some ofr autoinflammatory ones
and ones for cancers 
and for hemophilias and immunostimulatory agents 
1. cyclosporine + tacrolimus = will essentially inhibit the **prodution of IL-2**
	- inhibition of calcineurin, which removes the phosphatase for signal transduction events 
	- cyclosporine - binds to cyclophillin cytoplasmic protein directly 
	- tacrolimus - binds to FK506 binding protein FKBP !!! there's a lot of these but this one inhibits calcineurin directly 
	- normally TCR activation leads to mobilization of Ca2+ from stores and then activation of calcineurin, which is a ca2+ binding protein that promots dephosphorylation of NFAT
	- phosphorylated NFAT = stays in the cytoplasm + can't transactivate anything 
	- uses: organ transplant and GVHD afer sten cll transplant 
	- Tacrolimus - preferred in organ transplant prophalaxis, mroe potent than the cyclosporine. 
	- don't memorize drug drug interactions but this is metabolized by CYP3A4 
		- note - we have inhibition of CYP 3A4 = grapefruits 
		- induction of CYP3A4 = rifampin, st jjohns wort etc that can inc this metabolism that can dcrease thir eficacy 
2. sirolimus = mTOR inhibitor, structural analog of tacrolimus,binds a different FKBP, which inhibits an mTOR pathay that is downstream of IL-2 receptor signalling. 
	- prophylaxis of kidney transplant rejection 
	- less nephrotoxic 
	- pancytopenia, insulin resistance hyperlipidemia etc 
3. azathioprine = > 6-mercaptopurine, which will block up purine synthesis, GPAT 
	- this is more for immunosuppression not cancer (which is 6-m)
	- also check TPMT polymorphisms bfore prescribing 
		- tpmt will metabolize it!!! 
		- keep it away from allopurinol, don't combine! 

4. mycophenolate mofetil = inhibits IMP Dehydrogenase, which is needd for de novo purine synthesis 
	- inhibits both b. + t cells. preferential for lymphocyte making basically - know that it inhibits the enzyme pretty much. 
	- wide useage 
5. methotrexate - blocks GFHR and inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, inhibiting thymidine synthesis
	- RA
	- cancer chemo 

6. hydroxyurea - inhibits ribonucleotide reductase + dna syn... removing this 
	- reducing production f mutated beta hb in SCD, and inc production of fetal hbf..... to reduce the erythrocyte sickling in SCD 
	- note - reducing dNTPs will slow the erythrocyte dev, and inc overal size of rcs => macrocytosis 

targeted immunosuppressants - tofacitinib = small molecule inhibitor of JAK3, interfering with JAK-STAT signalling, which s signalling downstream of IL-2, 4, 13 receptors. stopping the dz RA, plaque psoriasis, UC and inc risk of infection (A)e

many monoclnal antibodies - are sorta subspecialty uses. just stick to the ones that are most commonly tested
