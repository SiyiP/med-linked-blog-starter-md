#summary #hemonc 

 platelet count/morpho = normal is 150k to 400k uL. 
hemostasis = below 150 k 
inc mean platelet vol = too many destructio so more are newly released
	bernard-soulier syndrome 
decreased MPV = bone marrow failure 

primary hemostasis - bv, platelets, von willebrane dz
secondary - clotting factors
fibrinolysis - tPA, PAI-1, and alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor 
misc coagulopathies - DIC, TTP 
- defect primary hemostasis - **platelet** count or functionality issue -> bleeding gums/superficial bruising or petechiae/low platelets
	- platelet light transmission aggregometry - checks ability of crtain regular platelet agonists to cause platelets to aggregate ... aggregation = more light passes thru 
	- GLANZMAN. = no aggregation except in ristocetin 
	- Bernard-soulier = normal aggregation in everything except ristocetin 
	-  von willebrand tests -
		1. vWf antigen 
		2. ristocetin cofactor = how much **functional vWF?**
		3. multimer analysis 
	1. von willebrand disease = most common , **aggregation/adhesion disorder**? - 
		- vWF binds between GPIb receptor + colalgen @ subendothelial injury sites. 
		- decrease in adhesion = more bleeding 
		- PTT slightly inc bc of factor 8 
		- type 1 = most common, multimers are there just lighter ; treat with Desmopressin 
		- type 3 = severe, almost like hemophilia A, ptt high, give cryoprecipitate with factor 8 concentrate
	- some vascular abnormalities can be primary issues like 
		- ehlers danlos - inherited AR/D, stretchy skin, easy bruising, collagen abnormal
		- hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia - HTT - aka osler-weber-rendu dz
			- red dots + lesions "blood blisters" on mucocutaneous membranes + skin 
			- epistaxis + GI hemorrhage
		- vasculities (septic) meningococcemia, and henoch-schonlein purpura after viral illness, igA hypersensitivity rxn 

- 2ndary hemostasis defect = in inhibitors or deficiencies in **coagulation** factors
	- soft tissue hematomas, 
	- **extensive bruising**
	- hemarthroses - **bleeding into a joint space**
	- more PT or PTT - meaning **prolnged prothrombin time or partial prolonged prothrombin time**
		- PT = more sensitive to common path deficiencies even tho this is accessing both common + extrinsic pathway coag factors
			- INR = normalizes PT testing as a ratio 
			- abnormality in factor 7 (a vitamin k associated thing remember)
			- warfarin 
		- PTT = intrinsic and common pathways... 
			- prolonged in type 3 vWD and hemophilia A
			- heparin
		- if both are messed up - think of multi factor deficiencies like vitamin K def or liver disease 
intrinsic path : 12 11 9 8 10 
common: 10 5 2 1 
extrinsic 7 
prolonged pt/ptt = either deficiency or inhibitor (IgG antibody here)
tT = thrombin time - time for the fibrin clot to form after thrombin addition. measures from the common pathway with the addition of thrombin aka factor II 
D-dimer - biggest thing for DIC 
- make fibrin polymer, then factor 13 will crosslink it to make it more stable. D-dimer is that crosslinker.

platelet disorders
quantitative 
1. thrombocytopenia w/ absent radii = TAR syndrom, inherited, AR, no forearm bones , other skeletal and card abnormalities, but normal liffespan after 1-2 yrs 
2. ITP = common, petechiae bruising in skin, epitaxis, gingival/GI/GU bleeds + rare intracranial hemorrhage 
	1. chronic = in adults, females, insidious, months to years 
	2. acute = in kids, abrupt and after viral infections 
	- in both of these, we develop autoantibody to proteins like GPIIb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor complex and ==GPIb/IX vWF receptor==; IgG against these guys 
	- presents in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Evans syndrome (when combined with anemia)
	- IVIG and splenectomy 
3. heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - 4-5 days post-therapy, they get **thrombosis**!!! bc PF-4, platelet factor 4 is affinity to heparin, which sticks together
	- IgG antibody to heparin-PF4 ... then binds the platelet + removes them. -> more aggregation -> thrombosis 

qualitative defects 
1. glanzmann's thrombasthenia - inherited, aggregation function, GIIb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor deficient, so you get epistaxis , severe bleeding 
	- transfuse platelets 
	- bleeding time prolonged but PT/PTT all normal 
	- only aggregate with ristocetin 
2. storage pool deficiencies = inhterited, granules not there. 
	1. gray platelet syndrome = no alpha granules , mild/mod bleeding 
	2. chediak-higashi syndrome - partial albinism, giant lysosomes, susceptible to pyogenic infections
	3. hemansky-pudlak syndrome - dense granule deficiency - rare except in northwest puerto rico, albinism, poor vision,
3. ASA, acquired ; - inhibition of COX1 causes more bleeding by inhibition of TXA  
4. clopidogrel inhibits P2Y, which inhibited ADP related platelet responses, causing more bleeding 

combined defects 
1. MYH 9 mutations = we see thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, **dohle-like bodies**, mild risk in bleeding 
2. bernard soulier "fat platelets" - adhesion issue - when platelets stick to wall - **vWF platelet receptor, GP/Ib/IX/X complex!!! deficiency**; 	- BT prolonged, PT/PTT normal , only able to adhere without ristocetin 
3. cirrhosis - htrombocytopenia is common, platelets belwo 150k 
4. VWD (above)
5. splenomegaly - sequesters platlets, and lowers counts ... seen with HIV/SLE

coagulopathies
1. hemophilia A = factor 8 def , XLD
	- petechiae absent
	- hemarthroses 
	- female carriers normal ish 
	- TREAT with either DDAVP or factor 8 concentrate
2. hemophilia B = facotr 9 deficient
	- christmas disease 
	- this time we got prolonged ptt instead 
3. hemophilia C = **factor 11 deficiency**
	- very rare, only frozen plasma helps
