#summary #hemonc 

 platelet count/morpho = normal is 150k to 400k uL. 
hemostasis = below 150 k 
inc mean platelet vol = too many destructio so more are newly released
	bernard-soulier syndrome 
decreased MPV = bone marrow failure 

primary hemostasis - bv, platelets, von willebrane dz
secondary - clotting factors
fibrinolysis - tPA, PAI-1, and alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor 
misc coagulopathies - DIC, TTP 
- defect primary hemostasis - **platelet** count or functionality issue -> bleeding gums/superficial bruising or petechiae/low platelets
	- platelet light transmission aggregometry - checks ability of crtain regular platelet agonists to cause platelets to aggregate ... aggregation = more light passes thru 
	- GLANZMAN. = no aggregation except in ristocetin 
	- Bernard-soulier = normal aggregation in everything except ristocetin 
	-  von willebrand tests -
		1. vWf antigen 
		2. ristocetin cofactor = how much **functional vWF?**
		3. multimer analysis 
	1. von willebrand disease = most common , **aggregation/adhesion disorder**? - 
		- vWF binds between GPIb receptor + colalgen @ subendothelial injury sites. 
		- decrease in adhesion = more bleeding 
		- PTT slightly inc bc of factor 8 
		- type 1 = most common, multimers are there just lighter ; treat with Desmopressin 
		- type 3 = severe, almost like hemophilia A, ptt high, give cryoprecipitate with factor 8 concentrate
	- some vascular abnormalities can be primary issues like 
		- ehlers danlos - inherited AR/D, stretchy skin, easy bruising, collagen abnormal
		- hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia - HTT - aka osler-weber-rendu dz
			- red dots + lesions "blood blisters" on mucocutaneous membranes + skin 
			- epistaxis + GI hemorrhage
		- vasculities (septic) meningococcemia, and henoch-schonlein purpura after viral illness, igA hypersensitivity rxn 

- 2ndary hemostasis defect = in inhibitors or deficiencies in **coagulation** factors
	- soft tissue hematomas, 
	- **extensive bruising**
	- hemarthroses - **bleeding into a joint space**
	- more PT or PTT - meaning **prolnged prothrombin time or partial prolonged prothrombin time**
		- PT = more sensitive to common path deficiencies even tho this is accessing both common + extrinsic pathway coag factors
			- INR = normalizes PT testing as a ratio 
			- abnormality in factor 7 (a vitamin k associated thing remember)
			- warfarin 
		- PTT = intrinsic and common pathways... 
			- prolonged in type 3 vWD and hemophilia A
			- heparin
		- if both are messed up - think of multi factor deficiencies like vitamin K def or liver disease 
		- if normal but see stron ghx of bleeding - check for vWD + factor 13 
intrinsic path : 12 11 9 8 10 
common: 10 5 2 1 
extrinsic 7 
prolonged pt/ptt = either deficiency or inhibitor (IgG antibody here)
tT = thrombin time - time for the fibrin clot to form after thrombin addition. measures from the common pathway with the addition of thrombin aka factor II 
D-dimer - biggest thing for DIC 
- make fibrin polymer, then factor 13 will crosslink it to make it more stable. D-dimer is that crosslinker.

platelet disorders
quantitative 
1. thrombocytopenia w/ absent radii = TAR syndrom, inherited, AR, no forearm bones , other skeletal and card abnormalities, but normal liffespan after 1-2 yrs 
2. ITP = common, petechiae bruising in skin, epitaxis, gingival/GI/GU bleeds + rare intracranial hemorrhage 
	1. chronic = in adults, females, insidious, months to years 
	2. acute = in kids, abrupt and after viral infections 
	- in both of these, we develop autoantibody to proteins like GPIIb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor complex and ==GPIb/IX vWF receptor==; IgG against these guys 
	- presents in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Evans syndrome (when combined with anemia)
	- IVIG and splenectomy 
3. heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - 4-5 days post-therapy, they get **thrombosis**!!! bc PF-4, platelet factor 4 is affinity to heparin, which sticks together
	- IgG antibody to heparin-PF4 ... then binds the platelet + removes them. -> more aggregation -> thrombosis 

qualitative defects 
1. glanzmann's thrombasthenia - inherited, aggregation function, GIIb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor deficient, so you get epistaxis , severe bleeding 
	- transfuse platelets 
	- bleeding time prolonged but PT/PTT all normal 
	- only aggregate with ristocetin 
2. storage pool deficiencies = inhterited, granules not there. 
	1. gray platelet syndrome = no alpha granules , mild/mod bleeding 
	2. chediak-higashi syndrome - partial albinism, giant lysosomes, susceptible to pyogenic infections
	3. hemansky-pudlak syndrome - dense granule deficiency - rare except in northwest puerto rico, albinism, poor vision,
3. ASA, acquired ; - inhibition of COX1 causes more bleeding by inhibition of TXA  
4. clopidogrel inhibits P2Y, which inhibited ADP related platelet responses, causing more bleeding 

combined defects 
1. MYH 9 mutations = we see thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, **dohle-like bodies**, mild risk in bleeding 
2. bernard soulier "fat platelets" - adhesion issue - when platelets stick to wall - **vWF platelet receptor, GP/Ib/IX/X complex!!! deficiency**; 	- BT prolonged, PT/PTT normal , only able to adhere without ristocetin 
3. cirrhosis - htrombocytopenia is common, platelets belwo 150k 
4. VWD (above)
5. splenomegaly - sequesters platlets, and lowers counts ... seen with HIV/SLE 
---
coagulopathies - alloantibodies can develop to antibodies they DONT have. 
1. hemophilia A = factor 8 def , XLD
	- petechiae absent
	- hemarthroses 
	- female carriers normal ish 
	- TREAT with either DDAVP or factor 8 concentrate
2. hemophilia B = facotr 9 deficient
	- christmas disease 
	- this time we got prolonged ptt instead 
3. hemophilia C = **factor 11 deficiency**
	- very rare, only frozen plasma helps 
antiphospholipids - coagulability, associated with thromboembolisms + miscarriages 
 - inc PTT!!! 

dysfibrinogenemia - very rare structurally abnormal fibrinogen inherited, see some major thrombosis ... TT primary screning test 

random: TTP
- abnoramlity in vWF, when the ADAMTS-13 proteinase is defectiv and doesn't cleave it into smaller piecs
	- fundamentally - **hyaline thrombi in capillaries and small arterioles** - leading to thrombocytopenia from consumption and RBC destruction microangiopathic hemolysis 
	- neuro changes are common 
	-  **high affinity to platelets - we get so much aggregation** via huge vWF
	- 	- anemia + schistocytes; hgb 8-9 due to the damage. 
	- congenital with ADAMTS13 
	- idiopathic due to autoantibodies
	- nonidiopathic = malignancy, pregnancy, meds 
	- give plasma 
HUS
-  microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 
- bloody diarrhea
- acute renal failure

gestational thrombocytopenia - normal usually due to dilution plasma inc 
HELLP - 	- nausea, malaise, abd pain and platelets <100k and elevated liver enzymes
NAIT = neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia - in the transfusion lectures, due to IgG maternal antibody to platelet specific antigen on fetus platelets 
trauma induced coagulopathy - this is bleeding NOT associated with the site of direct injury, seen in 40% of deaths 
		- cause of it - a lethal triad: hemodilution, acidosis, hypothermia 

---

RBC dz 

met hb - decreased o2 carrying capacity of hb - conversion of iron from reduced state to fe3+ state instead, ferric iron unable to bind/transport oxygen 
- basically acquired = more common, exposure to oxidizing agents of hb like nitrates 
- congenital - defect in cyt b5 reductase , mutations in globin protein too 
- signs and symptoms - chocolate brown blood, **hypoxemia refractory to supp o2**. dyspnea, anxiety, light-headedness, confusion, tachy, etc. 
- - TREAT: remove agent, methylene blue injection reducing agent + the supplemental oxygen 

haptoglobin - binds free heme for elimination processed thru macrophages in bone marrow, spleen, liver
- mean cell vol MCV = avg size of rbcs fL 
- MCH - mean cell hb - avg amt of hgb in each RBC in pg
- MCHC concntration - avg amt hb per certain concentration of rbs
- red cell distrib width RDW - amt of variability, higher is more variability % ;
polychromasia - bluish color in some cells bc of rna in reticulocytes. 



anemias
- ==Microcytic anemia include iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, sideroblastic anemia, and anemia of chronic disease.==
chronic diseases -> iron deficiency anemia 

hemolytic anemias - 
- mechanical trauma = DIC, TTP, HUS -> schistocytes + haptoglobn low + helmet cells 
- paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - complement mediated: happens in spleens - > see spherocytes that lose their central pallor
	- microspherocytes
	- no  CD59, 55, FLAER; lack GPI anchor proteins 
- glucose 6 phosphate dh = x linked recessive enzyme , in men all express it .... 
	- - deficiency = rbcs more prone to ox injury + hemolysis 
	- - **episodic hemolytic anemia, associated w drugs, toxins, fava beans + infections**
	- back pain + hemoglobuinuria 
	- **heinz bodies!!! = crosslinked globins**
- malaria too - headaches, cyclic fevers, joint pain, hemolytic anemia 
- autoimmune hemolytic anemias = normochromic, normocytic + spherocytes more!!!
	- phagocytosis in reticuloendothelial systems = extravascular, not complement mediated, warm rxn with just the IgG -> microspherocytes
		- warm causes - idiopathic, SLE, B cell lymphomas, drug induced 
	- cold dz = igM binds, fix the complement in the vessels as intravascular, complement, rbcs destroyed. 
		- b-cell lymphoms, mycoplasma/infectious mononucleosis infection 
		- raynaud's phenomenon seen!!
	- DAT/COOMbs positive 
- rbc membrane defects = hereditary spherocytosis = ankyrin, spectrin, band 3 defect, in cytoskeletal proteins
	- anemia, splenomegaly, jaundice, cholelithiasis
	- punctuated by hemolytic crises/infection or aplastic crises 
	- MCHC inc , ostmotic fragility test 
	- howell jolly bodies in asplenic pts 
- hereditary elliptocytosis too - defect in spectrin makes them more long... - dimers don't form 
- spectrin defect + deficiency = **hereditary pyropoikilocytosis** - basically not only dimers don't form, but you also get low levels of spectrin production
	- unusual burn trauma, thermal sensitivity weird 

---
hemoglobinopathies - single aa sub in globin chain, mod - severe ANEMIA
hbF - alpha 2, gamma 2 ; 2% in adults , be increased in adults beta thalassemia or HbSS
HbA2 - alpha 2 delta 2 , 1.5-4% of normal adult hb
	- beta thalassemia or megaloblastic anemia : increased 
	- decreased: iron def, sideroblastic anemia 

sickle 
- - polymerization in low o2 states, african descent, protective against malaria 
- HbA dom in heterozygous but more S 
- homozygous with sporatic pain, thrombosis, splenic sequestration, avascular necrosis of femoral head, precipitated by stresS: dehydration, hypoxemia, acidosis, infection + profound hemolytic anemia 
- howell-jolly bodies 
-  **hemoglobin F is protective in first few months
- hydroxyurrea inc hbF to protect against symptoms 

hbc = heterozygous get some target cells
homozygous hb CC = hemoglobin C disease
- clinicall yasymptomati, just a lot of target cells + intracellular crystals 
can mix and match double heterozygousity with hbS/C 

---
thalassemia = normal hb is made but not in good quantities
a-thalassemias - 4 total gene copies - mutations due to deletions, excess in unpaired chains. 
- normal -> silen carry -> alpha thal trait cis or trans. (mild microcytic hypochromic anemia) -> HbH dz (only one left, hemolytic anemia) -> hb Barts dz (hydrops fetalis)
	- anisocytosis , target ells etc in hetozygous
	- hbh dz = low mcv, deletion of 3 chains, high affinity o2 but not good for delivery 
	- hbbarts = unpaired y-globin. fetal demise usually 

b-thalassemias
- - excess a-chains precipitate bc unpaired
- chrmosome 11 
- due to point mutations + loss of heterogeniety 
-  b0 mutations = absent synthesis 
	- b+ mutations = reduced b synthesis 
	- all Hb A2 rises, and HbF increases with severity 
- minor = trait heterozygous for null or + 
	- 	- asymptomatic typically , mild/no anemia, microcytosis, RBC up 
- intermdeia - both + 
	- 	- symptoms present 6-9 mon after birth after **switch from F to A.**
- major = cooleys: one + or null for both genes
	- 	- most severe - no HbA 
	- 
	- severe anemia + transfusion dependent 6-9 mon post birth 
	- anisopoikilocytosis, nucleated rbcs, basophilic stippling
	- hairlike projections + **frontal bossing!!! splayed teeth!!!**
==combined S and a-thalassemia not that bad bc bad b-chains that are made from sickle cell have fewer a-chains to pair up with, so fewer HbS in circulation!!!==
combined HbS and b-thalassemia is way worse. 

---
aplastic anemia - failure of stem cells to make hematopoietic elements - peripheral blood we see cytopenias, can evolve into acute leukemias. - **marrow space looks like all fat.** -

inherited DNA repair or telomerase - all see bone marrow failures 
- faconi anemia - relatively rare AR disorder caused by defects in DNA repair - might have shortness, skeletal, endocrinopathy, renal failure, **cafe au lait spots**
- - pure red cell aplasia - selective decrease in rbc production - subtype of aplastic, **only erythroid lineage decreased**
	- 		- diamond-blackfan anemia DBA:inherited erythroid aplasia, isolated anemia , in infancy presenting + osteosarcoma risk - **short stature, craniofacial abnormalities, triphalangeal thumbs**
- 
macrocytic anemia- **these are PAST the stem cell progenitor**
	- inc MCV >100 
	- megaloblastic - a type of macrocytic -  DNA rep disorders,  due to folate/b12 deficincis
	- 		- decrease in reticulocytes + large immature rbcs in bone marrow
	- 		- **folate + b12 => pernicious anemia**
	- 			- b12 def = neurologic impairments, decreased sensation in lower extremities + demyelination - animal food sources - 
		- **haptocorrin protects b12 from degradation**,
	- pernicious anemia = antibodies target IF and parietal cells; pancytopenia, neuropath, papillary atrophy of tongue, pH elevation, psychosis. , do scilling test to see
	- folate deficiency - 				- **carbon transfer into many biochem rxns, purine synthesis to DNA synthesis**
	- 		- **macrovalicytes - oval teardrop macrocytes, anisopoikilocytosis, large platelets, nucleated RBCs, large neutrophils, ==hypersegmented== (usually 2-3+ too many ) neutrophils**
non megaloblastic - problem is outside the bone marrow
- hypoproliferative for rbcs bc of alc use, hyperhtryoidism, etc. 
- hyperprolifrative due to hemorrhage/hemolysis 
---
microcytic anemia 
- iron def = poor intake, malabsorption at the top, but other tests too 
- sr iron - iron bound to transferrin in blood normaly 60-170 
- tibc = transferrin available for binding iron,, usually oppoostie to ferrtin 
- %sat = amt of transferrin bound to iron - this is a percentage, 20-50 is normal
- ferritin - iron stores + inflammatory marker
chronic infection/inflammation - anemia of chronic dz , a neoplasm as well 
- mild or moderate, normo/microcytic anemia 
- **improper iron transfer, iron trapped in macrophages of bone marrow , so TIBC dec, sr iron dec, but FERRITIN UP**
- sideroblastic anemia - faulty incorperation of iron into protoporphyrin ring = **ringed sideroblasts**
	- inc ferritin, iron, %, but dec tibc
	- lead tox can be the cause 
	- also B6 deficiency, or myelodysplastic syndrome
	- pappenheimer bodies seen 
	- **overflow without evry using anything up!!!!**
iron def anemia stages
- storage depletion = low ferritin, igh tibc
- deplete sr iron = low iron + %sat 
- normocytic anemia 
- microcytic hypochromic anemia
