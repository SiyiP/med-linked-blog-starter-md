#summary 
HRR/SFP SAMs combination 
full house SLE = joint pain, myalgias and dark urine. Work-up included an ANA which was positive at a titer of 1:1024. Urinalysis was remarkable for hematuria and proteinuria

psoriatic arthritis + osteoarthritis usually involve the DIP 
 Reactive arthritis more commonly affects the joints of the lower legs (knees, ankles and feet

|---|---|
|In ==complement mediated HUS there is a problem with the inhibition of the alternate pathway==. C1 and C4 are in the classic pathway. CD59 is a GPI‐ linked protein found on RBCs and normally blocks binding of terminal complement components to present the formation of the membrane attack complex. ==Factor H is an inhibitor of the alternate pathway.==|   |

advanced donor age = association with higher rejection risk 

Acute antibody rejection occurs when recipient donor specific antibodies bind to donor endothelial antigens (usually HLA). This is most easily seen in the microvasculature, in particular, along the peritubular capillaries. C4d is the "footprint" of antigen/antibody binding.

HRR SAMS
zoonotic bac+viral infections
things that cause rocky mountain spotted fever (rickettsia rickettsii) = DIC due to Omp outer membrane proteins and phospholipase that invade and attach and dmg vascular endothelium 

dengue= more severe the 2nd time, recall = type 1 and type 2 ... breakbone fever is rarely fatal in primary infctions, but on 2nd epxposure, we have huge enhancement of 
- antibodies from the primary infection can bind to the second dengue virus and act as an opsonin without neutralizing the virus particle, enhancing uptake and replication in macrophage (antibody-mediated enhancement)
- this is dengue hemorrhagic fever which can be severe and fatal. 
rickettsiae prowasekii. - epidemic typhus, brill zinsser dz is only in this one 
- transmitted on louse human body 
- seen in extreme overcrowding in rare cases 
- sometims pet squirrels

dermacentor ticks = 
|_Rickettsia rickettsiae, Francisella tularensis_|
||

ixodies ticks = anaplasma phagocytophilium, erhlichia chafeensis, borrelia burgdorferi

aedes mosquitoes - chikungunya virus, yellw fever, dengue, zika 

anopheles mosquitos - plasmodium species 

human body louse - rickettsia prowazekii, bartonella quintana 

bartonella quintana = causes trench fever, associated with homeless, poor hygiene, and body lice. 
- relapsing fevers, tibia, granulomatous inflammation 
- warthin starry stain!!!!!

brucella melitensis - facultative intracellular gram-negative coccobacillus transmitted via unpasteurized dairy products or direct contact with infected animals
- undulating fever, arthralgia, and hepatosplenomegaly

tumor immunity 
ipilimumab ? - checkpoint inhibitor , target of CTLA-4 

==IFN-gamma = increases PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, made by Th1 CD4+ t cells + activated NK cells== 
- th1 helpers will use IFN-gamma to mature to it , and make more IFN-gamma
		==th1 helpers are best to see in tumor environment bc they will secrete IFN-g and help activate more CD8+ t cellls, which are the most effetive immune efector for elimination!!!==
- th17 t chelpers = they make il-17, which are very important to maintain mucosal barriers + pathogen clearance. this is huge autoimmuen thing. generated by tgf-beta and IL-6
- 
Adoptive T-cell therapy with expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes is most likey to fail when u have no MHC-1 because cytotoxic T-cells require MHC I in order to recognize and kill their target
- effector T-cells such as those transferred in adoptive T-cell therapy express PD-1, which would be engaged by the tumor-expressed PD-L1 and inhibit the T-cell function.
- NK cells are activated by an absence of MHC-I, so they would _not_ be most likely to fail
- PD-L1 is a checkpoint inhibitor, so anti-checkpoint inhibitor therapy would be expected to be effective against this tumor
- CAR-T cells use a chimeric antigen receptor that does not require MHC-presented antigen, and so they would also _not_ be most likely to fail.
	-  normal TCR require MHC and either CD4 or CD8 to provide enough affinity for the TCRs to recruit the many accessory signaling molecules
	- CAR replaces the TCR with the antigen binding domain of a high affinity antibody (specific for a tumor antigen) fused to all of the cytoplasmic signaling domains (ITAMs) of the required signaling molecules, tranducing the signal without all the accesstry moleculs 

rituximab = a igG antibody specific for CD20
- recall = CD20 - is on all mature b cells + and is a tumor associated antigen for any b cell cancers
- binding -> cell death by activating ADCC, nk cell mediated!!! remember this for most antibodies 

---
all immune receptors - recognize self antigens, which will be **presented by antigen presenting cells with antibodies made by b cells** in the central system 
-  tolerance - **lack of response to antigens** induced by exposure of lymphocytes to these antigens - via the adaptive immune system

tolerance is not immunodeficiency nor is it suppression
**tolerance** -  Antigen specific, property of t/b lymphocytes, and physiologically normal!!!
**immunodef/suppression** - not antigen specific, and can affect both innate/adaptive. can be induced/pathological + reversible. 

central tolerance
- stage 1: central tolerance: primary lymphoid tissue (bone marrow for B-cells, thymus for T cells) 
	- basically apoptosis or receptor b cell change if it retains ability to recognize self antigen 
	- in the thymus of t cells = it is first no cd4/9 -> pre-tcell receptor -> double poz cd4/8 -> weak recognition of MHC 2 and peptide via antigen presenting cells -> deletion of **CD8 receptor becoming poz selection for CD4+ mature T cell** 
	- ==small node - only cd4+ can become t regulatory cells which escape out in the thymus and into periphery in spite of negative selection==
		- no recognition of MHC+ peptide => apoptosis, **death by neglect**... and strong recognition of either -> apoptosis, neg selection
- - weak antigen recognition -> mature t/b cell
- Deletion and receptor editing in response to self-antigen recognition only occurs in bone marrow. 
	- more about receptor editing: immature B-cells are capable of activating unused alleles of Ig light chains when a heavy chain-light chain combination results in a BCR with strong affinity for self antigens
		- reactivate Rag gene to rearrange new light chain formation for new specificity 
	- If a self-reactive B-cell is not deleted by those central tolerance mechanisms and is released into the periphery (circulatory system, or secondary lymphoid tissues), if it encounters **any antigen that crosslinks its antigen receptors** in the ==presence o**f PAMPs or DAMPs (second signal)**== it will be **activated**. -> mechanism of autoimmune disease
		- if central tolerance fails to delete all self reactive lymphocytes they will be activated in periphery when co-stimulatory molecules are expressed in the presence of pamps/damps 


Stage 2: periphery peripheral tolerance in the mature lymphocytes 
- they can become anergic, undergo apoptosis, or the **regulatory t lymphocytes cd4+ earlier can suppress them**
	1. anergy - long lived state f unresponsiveness to antigenic stim in lymphocytes
		- t-reg cells have cell-cell contact with APCs that express CTLA-4 which removes B7 molecules CD80/86 from APC by trans-endocytosis 
			- recall:  induction of co-stim molecules on apc presenting self-antigens; 	- infections -> **rheumatoid arthritis, bc it will alter the proteins in the cell to make them recognized as non-self and elicit adaptive immune responses** 
		- r==ecall that we typically need costim by B7 molecules, so essentially we **take away the costimulatory signal = anergy**==
		- ==alternatively we achieve anergy by using the CTLA-4 binding to eat up the B7 space as a competitive inhibitor== 
			- mutation in CTLA4 = impaired reg t cell function 
	- PD-1 , not expressed on t-regs , ==inhibits any signals from TCR complex + CD28== = taking away that secondary stimulation, so in effector phase = ==**signaling inhibitor; *peripheral tissues!!!***. CD8>CD4+== 
	1. . activation induced cell death -  peripheral t cell deletion = AICD... this is in absence of low/no costimulators, **no IL-2 so we have death, since IL-2 is typically an inhibitor of the apoptotic proteins**
		1. FAS: autoimmmune lymphoproliferative syndrome alps; defective apoptosis of self reactive t and b cells of **periphery
		2. FAS-FASL = induce apoptotic death of SELF reactive lymphocyte s
	2. tolerance central due to **AIRE** - if we mutate htis we have APS, causing defective elimination of self reactive t cells 
		- this protein controls expression of self-antigens in thymus = **CENTRAL self tolerance**

B cells in periphery 
- anergy happens due to no t cells 
- apoptosis - triggered by self antigens in periphery, happens with newly emerged transitional b cells
	- FAS: autoimmmune lymphoproliferative syndrome alps; defective apoptosis of self reactive t and b cells of **periphery

CTLA-4 is a checkpoint inhibition molecule expressed by T-cells only (CTL is in the name - so easy to remember)
- expression is **induced on T-cells after activation** by **antigen (effector T-cells)**, so it acts in the ***periphery***. 
- is also expressed constitutively on Tregs, which are an effector of peripheral tolerance.

CD4+ marker
- TH1, TH2(b cell recruited to make antibody mediated) and Tregs 
- diet/autoimmunity - some debates - Vita D - decrease that Th1 cell responses + inc T reg 
		- celiac dz - autoimmune dz triggered by glutin in ppl , igA autoantibodies
		- iodine - excess - inc iodinization of thyroglobulin - more immunogenic 

IFN-gamma
- marker of TH1 cells

FoxP3 is a transcription factor unique to Tregs
- also expression of CD25 is high for Tregs   - they make cytokines that block macroophage activation: IL-10, TGF-b... but they also deplete IL-2 and other inflammatory cytokines TNF+ IL1 
- mutation in FoxP3 =  X-linked polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy (IPEX). 

Nod2 = Crohns disease, Blau syndrome. It encodes a protein expressed in monocytes, macrophage, dendritic cells and some intestinal epithelial cells that activates NF-kappaB in response to bacterial PAMPS - 

immune privilege - don't have self antigens that are in these areas, so thre's no activation there; includes brain, eyes, testes, placenta/fetus 
- The fetus is normally protected by passive and active immune privilege such that the mother's immune system is not exposed to fetal antigens via the placenta during pregnancy
- breakdown of this privilege -> how we get Rh+ moms 
- abundance of t-regs or physical separation from intestines/cutaneous immune systems like mucus, etc. keratin in skin protects our microbiome and all that 

PD-1 binding to PD-L1 or B7 on APC is primarily a mechanism producing **anergy** in effector T-cells in peripheral tissues, including tumors.

Bystander activation or epitope spreading
- autoreactivity can lead to tissue injury + subsequent immune responses to additional antigens 

IL-10 mutations - infantile enterocolitis, defective suppression of immune responses to commensal bacteria

## Highlights for -HRR Introduction to Clinical Immunological Tests_Litwin
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR and CRP = very sensitive but not specific, they're just acute phase reactants and can be elevated in many diseases[^15]
	- ESR - how fast RSCs settle to bottom of tube in 1 hr? faster it settles = higher the ESR. so acute phase reactants would negate that charge and make cells sequester.[^15]
- Measure - C3 - classic + alt pathways[^15]
- Measure - C4 - classic pathway only[^15]
	- Activations of complement cascade, C3/4 decreases with complement activation secondary to immune complex disease bc it gets cleaved[^15]

Rheumatoid factor - typically IgM against Fc portion of igG[^15]
- Not specific, and can interfere with ELISA testing[^15]
- Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide Anti-CCP wayyy better for rheumatoid arthritis[^15]

Connective tissue diseases - anti nuclear antibody testing - antibodies to specific parts of nucleus of cell[^15]
- Cytoplasmic/nucleolar pattern - SLE[^15]
- Speckled pattern - the most nonspecific, can be caused by infections too[^15]

ANA - antinuclear antibody[^15]
- Anti-DNA antibodies/anti-histone - seen in drug induced lupus[^15]
- Nucleolar pattern - systemic scleroderma[^15]
- Centromere pattern - CREST/limited variant of scleroderma[^15]
Extractable nuclear antigens ENAs - can be done with the ANA, coat cells with extractable nuclei and extract all separate parts of nucleus[^15]

ANCA - anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies - mostly for any ANCA-associated vasculitis[^15]
- If there's renal dysfunction in patient - do this stat.[^15]
- P-ANCA = lobulated nucleus, perinuclear - myeloperoxidase is seen[^15] = *eosinophilic* granulomatosis w/ polyangiitis + microscopic polyangiitis 
- C-ANCA - cytoplasmic dye around the cytoplasm ; proteinase 3 is there[^15] - granulomatosis with polyangiitis 

False poz test for syphilis due to anticardiolipin, associated with 1/2 of SLE[^15]
- Antiphospholipid syndrome- women lose many pregnancies due to abortions - this is the cause, venous and/or arterial thromboses[^15]

SPEP patterns[^15]
- 1st peak = albumin, 2nd = alpha -1, 3rd alpha-2, 4th peak = b-globulin(complement, fibrinogens, clotting etc) , 5th peak is gamma (immunoglobulins)[^15]
- Alpha 2 inc when gamma's not = acute inflammatory[^15]
- Chronic inflammatory - when gamma starts to increase too bc this time you're making antibodies[^15]
- Monoclonal proteins - found in multiple myeloma - sharp peak seen[^15]
- Nephrotic syndromes + losing enteropathy - see a decrease in proteins[^15]
- Immunofixation - used to determine the actual composition of the monoclonal spike[^15]

TB tests 
- Type 4 hypersensitivity = tuberculin skin test - t cells - skin test , 2-3 days to see rxn[^15]
	- PPD - crude protein used to detect the tb.[^15]
	- False poz to bcg, some immune reactivity to non tb mycobacteria ntms[^15]
- IGRAs[^15]
	- We isolate the t cells and check for memory t cell responsiveness to release gamma interferon[^15]
	- Specific for tb- these are not false poz.[^15]
	- QFT -[^15]
		- Neg control - look for bgd IFN-g, bc u can have that with uncontrolled hiv etc.[^15]
		- Incubate whole blood overnight. add the antigens - wait for them to make interferon-g.[^15]
		- Typical poz - NIL low (normal ppl have big response to mitogen) ; then subtract the TB Ag - Nil = more than 10 basically[^15]
		- Typical neg - low nil, tb ag low , mitogen 10+[^15]
		- Indeteminant - if Nil high, may be due to recent illness[^15]

Alternate test - T-spot, count the dots[^15]
Collect blood mononuclear cells , add these to a big titer well, then it's coated with IFN-g receptors[^15]

liver transplant 
orthotopic operation - same place as native organ, remove that old one and place in the new one 
kidney transplant - **heterotopic** - **the kidney goes into the pelvis instead of the native position** 
pancreas - midline incision, retract the intestines up, and then sew pancreas to the common iliac a + vena cava 

liver = less immune reactive than < kidney < heart - we measure genetic disparity looking at the HLA profile 
	transplant immunology - what mechanism does **alloreactive/rejection** occur? 

**acute** rejection is a - t cell mediated b cell response = primary mechanism ; this happens within the YEAR ; this is an adaptive immune system phenomenon! 
- this is type II and iV , mediated by t cells ; CD8+ kills graft cells directly and CD4+ make cytokines + induce inflammation 
1. antigen presentation - recipient blood -> transplanted organ, with the blood, the APCs and T cells of the recipient enters to interact directly 
	- direct pathway: APC of DONOR has HLA/peptide complex presented to the TCR of the T cells in recipient; i, the donor, take part of myself to show you, the recipient t cell, if i pass the vibe check directly. 
	- indirect:  APC of recipient presents **donor antigen** to their own recipient T cells - i took a piece of the donated! 
	- semidirect: endocytosis of donor HLA, inside the recipient's APC , so we now have the donor's HLA peptide complex on the surface. but the recipient's APC still presents to the recipient t cells. 
		- basically I absorbed the scaffolding from the donated and then use it on my surface to present it to myself!
2. TCR binding  with T helper cell activation, binding that antigen in the context of mhc
3. costimulation
4. clonal proliferation of t cell via IL-2 -> Th1 => acute rejection .... making of t cells more!!!
5. B cell activation, via t cells binding the MHC on the b cell, activating it.
6. 1. antibody production by the B cells = antibodies direct towards antigen of the donor that was recognized by the t cells
7. ab-mediated complement activation pathway

chronic rejection by memory cells, fibrotic changes and huge histo changes, slow ;; can happen past a year 
obliterative lesions in all solid organ transplants = vascular lesions in all transplant grps, organ specific obliterative lesions like the obliterative bronchiolitis in lung or vanishing bile duct in liver 
- - chronic inflammatory rxn - **walls of vessels get more and more thick, will close up the lumena, causing ischemia/occlusion** -> arteriosclerosis !!! endothelial injury + parenchyma **fibrosis**
- you see some new glomerular membrane, like reduplication of the **basement membrane + fibrosis of tubular interstitium**

- hyperacute rejection = when all the bullets are ALREADY out of the gun. minutes to hours; **non-treatable and pre-formed antibody**. very uncommon here, esp since we try to do crossmatching 
	-  type 2 = antibody mediated, antibodies against tissue/cells = **hyperacute!!!, pre-formed antibodies that are already in recipient, EX) abo blood groups**
	- preformed antibody -> complement activation -> neutrophil margination -> inflammation -> thrombus ; ghosted and pale glomerulus 

transplant drugs; [[*C MMT SAMS-Pharm]] - mainly what's on it 
1. induction therapy - 
	1. t cell depletion - stop the first step, maintain the low level of activity  
	- t cell blocking 
	- b cell depletions 
	- steroid 
2. maintenance therapy 
	1. ==calcineurin inhibitor== = workhorse agent for transplant rejection - basically this will be tacrolimus** - maintenance immunosuppression 
		1. most of the AE: kidney failures 
	2. antimetabolites
	- steroids
	- **costimulatory blockade- belatacept - does NOT have nephrotoxicity**, can be used instead of tacrolimus/other calcineurin inhibitors - but rate of rejection is higher  
	- mTOR inhibitors 
3. salvage therapy 
	1. steroids
	2. t cell agents
	3. b cell agents
"allotolerance - teaching ur organs to accept non-self"
- **adding the t cell components of the donor to the recipient**

---
immune response to transplants - get a big picture look 0: 
 - autologous - graft in same person from one part to the other
- syngeneic - identical twins isograft
- allogeneic - allograft, diff member of same species 
- xenogeneic - xenograft - one species to another 

rejection - t cells + antibodies made against antigens react and destroy - huge thing is HLA proteins as the main thing 
- this is memory specific + lymphocyte mediated which points to adaptive phenomenon 

alloantigens - HLA MHC molecules are what we try to match for. 
- - **HLA genes are highly polymorphic, always some differences unless they're Identical twins** 
	- bone marrow transplantation - requires match, but a slightly incomplete match generates **graft vs leukemia, which is therapeutic effect of incomplete match
		- we lowkey WANT a bit of diversion for graft vs. leukemia effect!!!
	- but in solid organ transplant, kidneys we need it to match exctly. 
- - heart and lungs = matched on size, blood group + gender. such rare organs. 

hematopoietic stem cell transplant - to treat hematopoietic malignancies, aplastic anemia or immunodiff
- - HLA matching - match as much as we can, at least 6/8 HLA = recall: **curative basis for this is graft vs leukemia!!!**
- - radiation blasting **recipient** to destroy their immune system - basically injecting them full of cells that aren't their own to make sure they repopulation 
	- we want to prevent graft vs host dz, where the donate t cells's  attack the recipient's t cells!!! = a huge issue with allogenetic transplants 
	- can be acute or chronic 
	- 	- **jaundice, rash, diarrhea; liver, skin, GI tract** 

in kidneys if there is acute rejection
- tubulointerstitial = busy and full of inflammation + dark cells with halos , filled with t cells!!! 
	vascular inflammation = lymphocytes are inside the vessels, completely occluded. automatically highest degree of rejection to have. 
		- TREAT: with corticosteroids + antithymocyte globulin at higher rate aggro infection 

antibody mediated rejection 
- paired up with complement activation usually 
- circulating anti-graft antibodies - donor specific antibodies called DSA 
		- presence of intra-graft deposition of complement *C4d* = **a complement split product after activation!!! in response to vascular damage, it will be along the capillaries
- you get capillaritis, microvascular inflammation involving glomeruli severely 
- C4d split product from the C4 is without known biological function = it's a highly stable covalent bond and **remains bound like a footprint to the vessel walls while the antibodies that were on the walls disappear over time**
	- so this C4d is a stain = due to its adhesion, a **marker!!! to indicate complement attack**
	- 	- both ab and cellular mediated rejection = presenting same way clinically with fever or tenderness over graft + inc creatinine 

---
response to tumors 
emerging hallmarks - deregulation of cellular energetic, avoid immune destruction, tumor promoting inflammation 

microenvironment and a micro-organ = the tumor 
- cancer stem cells - few of these, very crucial for tumor regrowth even if all cancer cells are murked
- - cancer associated fibroblasts - crosstalk between fibroblasts + cancer cells 
- immune inflammatory cells - promote the tumor 
- endothelial cells 

tumors can exist without disease, like 1/3+ women have in situ tumors in breast, but actual cancers are 1%... **meaning immune system holds it at bay**. 
	- **cancer immunosurveillance - huge host protection**
	- **adaptive immunity against it** ; like immune responses against tumors inhibit the tumor growth. 
	- also u can transfer immune arm onto another to prevent tumors, transfer the lymphocytes 
- 	- immunodeficient ppl have a higher rate of some tumors 

TSA: tumor-specific antigens = proteins only expressed by tumors
tumor ASSOCIATED antigens - normal cell hve it but **overexpressed** in tumor cells 
- - CTAG cancer testis antigen = tissue differentiation, and MAGE - melanoma associated antigen 
- - overexpressed proteins - like tyrosinase during cancer, happen = malignant melanoma 
- - oncofetal: AFP/CEA = produced during development, but not made when immune system develops "shouldn't be seen in an adult"
	- AFP = germ cell tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma 
	- CEA = bowel cancers , occasionally lung/breast

how t cells do it 
- mutated self protein -> will be recognized by t cells as foreign
- mutated oncogene / mutated tumor suppressor gene = TSAs! 
	-  Ras/Bcr/Abl fusion = all proto-oncogenes
	- tumor suppressors = p53 (this will be lost)

- or there's oncogenic viruses = HPV/EBV,  activation latent viral DNA 

tumor rejection immune mechanisms 
 1. t cell receptor will recognize the peptide in the MHC 
2. costimulation via ==CD28==, OX40, 4-1BB etc (these depend on the tissue)
3. ==cytokines==, by the CD4+ helper T cells, which help the **CD8+ t cell clonally expand, which will now see and recognize the tumor and kill them all

elimination of tumor cells - CD8+ cytotoxic granules
- - ==death ligand expression = where FasL and TRAIL== can **activate extrinsic apoptosis program , binding to death receptors on target cell**

but cancerls can evade this!!! immunoediting in phases:
1. 1. phase 1 elimination - everything works, all the crosspresentation etc... everything above works, so the tumor growth < cell death... so we don't even know there was a tumor 
2. equilibrium phase 2 = tumor cell VARIANTS survive, evade
	- tumors antagonize the th1 response (cell mediated immunity) but genetic instability they mutate still
	- evasion works by 
		- - tumor cell can just not display that peptide anymore
		- or not display MHC 1 
		- most commonly: **tumor makes inhibitory ligand, telling t cell to shut down** -> expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells 
		- of have IL-23 = making CD4+ proinflammatory, promoting a tumor 
		- TGF-b = gives you t-reg cells which will make tumor progress by suppressing the CD8+ 
		- IL-4 can make the cell mediated stuff shut up and do antibody response instead, **and antibodies aren't that effective against tumors, not helpful**
tumor environment would as a result make the **type 2 microenvironment**
- Tregs and everything else shuts down the immune function 
- tumor milieu - immune system doesn't function anymore
- type 1 response is the t cells attacking 
1. phase 3: escape
	1. now we got a type 2 environment, more and more tumor growth = death 

immunotherapy 
- higher specificity than chemo/radiation 
cytokine therapy -
3 groups interferons:
	- type 1(IFN-a, IFN-b), type 2(IFN-g) , type 3 (IFN-delta)
	- IFN-a only one approved for leukemias/lymphomas, renal cell cancer + melanoma 
- interleukins
	- il2 = toxic, sustains the t cells response, expanding t cells without loss of functionality + regressions might occur
	- IL15 = sustains T cell + NK cell prolif;l less toxic but recomb protein shortlived. 

Dendritic cell therapy - take dendritic cells from patient, pulsed them with tumor lysate/short peptides which respond to antigen of tumor , then inject back in
- dendritic cells would antigen present to the tumor-specific t cells 
1. MUC1 = epithelial mucin , helps patients show immunity against tumors and against this. 
	1- mmunogenic + safe but not effective
		helpful against low tumor burden but high recurrence chance like colon cancer 

antibody therapy - end in -mab 
immune checkpoints = basically IFN-gamma mediated expression of PD-L1 
- - th1 response = secretion of IFN-g by lymphocytes
- - IFN-g -> **PD-L1 expression in tumor cells**
- this inhibits the T cell. so we need to block this 

recall: CTLA-4 - B71 and B72 binding to this inhibits the t cell killing
- you need to generate the antibody that blocks this 

immune cell therapies  **risk of living drugs: 
	- **basically you can't control the dose or impact of the dose that well if the cells are alive**
	- cytokine release syndrome**, too many t cells put into girl and expanded too fast: released everything, caused a lot of illness!!!
	- HUGE con: takes like 8 wks to grow special cells, and they may not have that long to live. 
- - tumor infiltrating lympohcytes (TIL)
	- harvesting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes for **expansion in vitro, then putting them back in - not all pts have these**
- t cell receptor TCR gene modded cells
	- take peripheral t cells , transduce with vector carrying TCr specific for tumor antigen, and then readminister
	- drawback - **we need the specific TCR and also it's restricted to Class 1 MHC**
- adoptive t cell transfer protocol 
- engineered cell therapy - - if we know the tumor antigen, we can make a chimeric antigen receptor instead
	- CARs inside T cell = same as a TCR, but on the outside, acts like an antibody 	- so it's not necessarily MHC 1 restricted, everyone is eligible 
	- why there are so many of these products - many domains and also many costimulatory molecules can be used. 
	-
