lymphoids = t and b cell, think lymphomas - in lymphoid tissues 
myeloids = literally everything else like granulocytes, monocytes, tc, leukemias (from the bone marrow) - progression marked. 
![[WBC neoplasm framework]]

non-neoplastic 
do blood smear slides with flow cyt 
order a wbc diff = might alr be part of the processs

![[flow cyt wbcs organization.png]]

- neutrophils - 60% differential, phagocytosis, very short lived 1 day in blood, 5 days in tissues lifespan
- lymphocytes 30% b cells make antibods, t cells regulate, NK cells innate immunity, longer lived wks-yrs
- monocytes - 5% - phagocytosis + antigen presentation and shortlived hrs - days lifespan
- eosinophils - 2-3%, degranulating and making cytokines, 1-1.5 wks lifespan
- basophils - 1%, these are very dark granulated (nucleus obstructed) + chunky, releases histamines, hrs-days lifespan 
bone marrow biopsy - 
- 1st component - aspirate liquid marrow
- 2nd = core biopsy 
- least pref = sternal aspirate only ,,, if posterior iliac crest isnt' seen

- myeloid stem cells = everything other than lymphocytes. 

leukocytosis due to non neoplasm - accelerated immune activation, infection, enlarged spleen 
leukpenia - production failure/accelerated destruction, inadequate granulopoiesis, = dec granulocyte count in bone marrow as hyperplasia
- aplastic anemia
- external drug immunosuppression 
- myelodysplastic syndrom -  a lot of production, but doesn't make it into circulation bc ineffective maturation**

1. cyclic neutropenia- regular fluctuations in number of neutrophils in peripheral blood, like 21 day freq = elane gene, opportunistic infections with fever, oral mucosal ulcers, resp infections
	1. treat regular blood count monitoring, prevention of infections, **G-CSF granulocyte colony stimulating factor**


lymphopenia - mainly viral - acquired via hiv/aids/covid 
- if congenital think SCID and combined immune def
- digeorge - microdeletions in chromosome 22 - thymic aplasia 

left shift - when we see inc in bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes = immature cells/granulocytes! 
bone marrow full of blasts 

neutrophilia = leukemoid rxn with mainly neutrophils, mild left shift with some bands
- benign, some response to cellular stress!!!
- reactive cll changs = toxic granulation, **dohle bodies?**
leukoerythroblastic response - also granulocytic left shift, but fuller spectrum of myeloid maturation, nucleated RBCs etc = **seen in some massive trauma or bone marrow replacement or hemolytic anemia**
- chronic myeloid leukemia - left disorder of myeloid maturation = rare nucleated rbcs!! 50+K/uL ay higher , more basophilia 

reactive benign leukocytosis 
- neutrophilia - can be iatrogenic liek steroids, G-CSF, bacterial infections 
- eosinophilia - mostly type 1 hypersensitivity rxns like mast cells or parasites
- basophilia - think neoplastic lowkey 
- ==monocytosis = travels with neutrophilias, seen with chronic infections + autoimmune== 
- -lymphocytosis - viral mainly - like infectious mononuc = EBV/CMV, larg inc in lymphocytes 
	- spread thru salaiva, CD8+ look huge 
	- 	- fever, malaise, night sweats, dysphagia, lymphadenopathy and toncilitis, also splenomegaly
	- avoid contact sports bc splenic rupture 
	- look at it thru monosspot test 

reactive/atypical lympohcytosis
- - reactive benign mature lymphocytes - heterogenous/clumped chromatin 
- low nuc:cyt ratio ballerina skirting with no nucleoli 
blasts = smooth, open, homogenou hcromatic, high nuc;zcyt ratio, prominent nucleoli, auer rod + velvet chromatin 

lymph nodes = normally have b cells in cortex, and then 2ndary have grminal centers where b cells mix with follicular dendritic cells
macrophages will clean it up, 
then the b cells mature and go to the mantle zone lightly outside hte germinal center 

follicular hyperplasia =  b cell prolif , follicles no longer limited to cortex, multiplying in number no longer jsut inthe cortex but spreading
- - have a lot of macrophages in the center. 
- rheumatoid arthritis, syphillis, hiv 
- - intact mantle zones + marginal zones 

interfollicular/paracortical hyperplasia - **t cell prolif, since they live in between b cell nodes,** expanded interfollicular/paracortical areas
- - intact follicles but spaced **far apart**
- - associated w viral infections, post-vaccination, drug rxns, dermatopathic lymphadenitis - skin irritation. 

sinusoidal hyperplasia - most often histiocytes(macrophages/dendritic cells)- lots of pale pink cytoplasm and irregularly shaped cells
- variety of causes, langerhans cell histiocytosis, rosai dorfman dz 

mixed patterns? = we can see granulomas 
- - non-necrotizing granulomas - sarcoidosis + nonspecific rxn to malignancy 
- - necrotizing ganulomas - fungal, tb, cat scratch (henselae) dz , or stellate / serpentine ones are have central neutrophils 

hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. - MAS macrophage activation syndrome - can be lethal -  fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and DIC after a viral infection
- high serum ferritin levels are seen in HLH. 
- "- hyperviscocity syndrome"
- - abnormal rxn to viral or proinflammatory exposure - **huge cytokines -> phagocytosis of normal blood cells!** = widespread inflammation + organ failure. 
- - defect in - **CD8+ and NK cells. can be caused by t cell neoplasms, defects or Xlinked lymphoproliferative disorder XLLPD**
nonspecific symptoms - fever splenomegaly pancytopenia rapidly progressing to DIC/organ failure!
- 
- DX: bone marrow shows hemophagocutosis, high ferritin, hypertriglycerides, high soluble IL-2 receptor

neoplastic
CD 1920s = think Bs 
CD 5,7,4,8 single numbers = think Ts 
Myeloid numbers are in 3s, 13, 30,etc
classic monocytic markers are CD14, 64, 68 
- TdT staining screens for T-cell **lymphoblastic** lymphoma. 
- - Myeloperoxidase stains mark a **myeloid** lineage of cell type. 
- Coombs testing detects antibodies that can cause hemolysis of red cells.
- - Flow cytometry can easily discriminate the clonal CD5, CD23 positive B‐ cells with immunoglobulin light chain restriction of CLL from non‐ neoplastic lymphocytes. 

mantle cell lymphoma - overexpressed cyclin D1, from t(11;14) - regulates the prog of cell cycle from g1 to s phase 

burkitt lymphoma - high prolif index Ki-67, starry sky from pale macrophags contianing tumor debris = "tingible body macrophages", and (8;14) involve myc , poz for CD10 but not CD5 (common in CLL and mantle cell lymphomas)

follicular lymphomas - no tingible body macrophages 
normal germinal cells don't express BCL-2 but the follicular one has the mmunoglobulin heavy chain translocated next to it, so it overexpresses + inhibits apoptosis ! 
(14;18), paratrabecular aggregates of CD20+ b cells 

normal germinal center b cells + for CD10, negative for bcl-2 

- polycythemia vera (markedly elevated hematocrit, suppressed erythropoietin. Most cases of polycythemia demonstrate a JAK2 mutation. 
- - LAP score measures the activity of alkaline phosphatase in leukocytes;  -> low score= CML, and higher score = leukemoid rxns, which are normal 
-  TRAP stain (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) stains the TRAP enzyme causing the cytoplasm to be red and granular; it is relatively unique to hairy cell leukemia vs. other leukemias.

multiple myeloma
rouleaux formation of the RBC's, and the clinical history documents multiple "CRAB" criteria (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions), highly suspicious for plasma cell myeloma. 

AML = auer rods (fused lysosomes!!!) = acute myeloid leukemia 
- 20%+ blasts in periphery or bone marrow.... 
- cytopenias = bone marrow failure, thrombocytopenia (bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses), anemia, neutropenia 
- b symptoms are simply everything else, nonspec - fever night sweats, weight loss, bone pain, splenomeg, hepatomeg
blasts are = larger than lymphoid blasts , nucleolus + cytoplasmic granules seen 
types of AMLs: 
1. acute promyelocytic leukemia - DIC + white count of 150000 - immature wbcs + auer rods
	- t(15;17), if poz, treat iith ATRA bc it induces the maturation 
	- bilobed, butterfly/kidney shaped nuceli 
	- hypergranular form has many cyt and some auer rods, but can also be few and no visible granules/stuff
	- **causes DIC!!!!!!**
	- targets ==PML/RAR fusion protein== = this will block transcription/diff of granulocytes, stopping it from getting mature. 
	- 		- poz - CD117, CD33, CD13, neg for CD34, HLA-DR
- 

dysplasia in all 3 hematopoietic cells lines = MDS 
- patients with myelodysplastic syndrom high risk of getting acute myeloid leukemia 

classically CML = chronic myeloid leukemia 
-  Left shifted granulocytes indicated the presence of immature ==granulocytes (myeloid lineage==) in the peripheral blood
- seen in infections, but a 150,000 white cell count is a leukemic process.
- poor prognosis t(9;22), BCR-ABL1 protein, a active tyrosine kinase 
	- must use imatinib to target this when in blast crisis 

CLL = looks like normal lymphocytes, but you can determine clonality by surface immunoglobulin light chain restriction 
- Expression of CD5 and CD23 on the clonal B-cells is classic for CLL.
