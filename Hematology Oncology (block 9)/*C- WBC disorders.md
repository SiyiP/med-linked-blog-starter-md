lymphoids = t and b cell, think lymphomas - in lymphoid tissues 
myeloids = literally everything else like granulocytes, monocytes, tc, leukemias (from the bone marrow) - progression marked. 
![[WBC neoplasm framework]]

non-neoplastic 
do blood smear slides with flow cyt 
order a wbc diff = might alr be part of the processs

![[flow cyt wbcs organization.png]]

- neutrophils - 60% differential, phagocytosis, very short lived 1 day in blood, 5 days in tissues lifespan
- lymphocytes 30% b cells make antibods, t cells regulate, NK cells innate immunity, longer lived wks-yrs
- monocytes - 5% - phagocytosis + antigen presentation and shortlived hrs - days lifespan
- eosinophils - 2-3%, degranulating and making cytokines, 1-1.5 wks lifespan
- basophils - 1%, these are very dark granulated (nucleus obstructed) + chunky, releases histamines, hrs-days lifespan 
bone marrow biopsy - 
- 1st component - aspirate liquid marrow
- 2nd = core biopsy 
- least pref = sternal aspirate only ,,, if posterior iliac crest isnt' seen

- myeloid stem cells = everything other than lymphocytes. 

leukocytosis due to non neoplasm - accelerated immune activation, infection, enlarged spleen 
leukpenia - production failure/accelerated destruction, inadequate granulopoiesis, = dec granulocyte count in bone marrow as hyperplasia
- aplastic anemia
- external drug immunosuppression 
- myelodysplastic syndrom -  a lot of production, but doesn't make it into circulation bc ineffective maturation**

1. cyclic neutropenia- regular fluctuations in number of neutrophils in peripheral blood, like 21 day freq = elane gene, opportunistic infections with fever, oral mucosal ulcers, resp infections
	1. treat regular blood count monitoring, prevention of infections, **G-CSF granulocyte colony stimulating factor**


lymphopenia - mainly viral - acquired via hiv/aids/covid 
- if congenital think SCID and combined immune def
- digeorge - microdeletions in chromosome 22 - thymic aplasia 

left shift - when we see inc in bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes = immature cells/granulocytes! 
bone marrow full of blasts 

neutrophilia = leukemoid rxn with mainly neutrophils, mild left shift with some bands
- benign, some response to cellular stress!!!
- reactive cll changs = toxic granulation, **dohle bodies?**
leukoerythroblastic response - also granulocytic left shift, but fuller spectrum of myeloid maturation, nucleated RBCs etc = **seen in some massive trauma or bone marrow replacement or hemolytic anemia**
- chronic myeloid leukemia - left disorder of myeloid maturation = rare nucleated rbcs!! 50+K/uL ay higher , more basophilia 

reactive benign leukocytosis 
- neutrophilia - can be iatrogenic liek steroids, G-CSF, bacterial infections 
- eosinophilia - mostly type 1 hypersensitivity rxns like mast cells or parasites
- basophilia - think neoplastic lowkey 
- ==monocytosis = travels with neutrophilias, seen with chronic infections + autoimmune== 
- -lymphocytosis - viral mainly - like infectious mononuc = EBV/CMV, larg inc in lymphocytes 
	- spread thru salaiva, CD8+ look huge 
	- 	- fever, malaise, night sweats, dysphagia, lymphadenopathy and toncilitis, also splenomegaly
	- avoid contact sports bc splenic rupture 
	- look at it thru monosspot test 

reactive/atypical lympohcytosis
- - reactive benign mature lymphocytes - heterogenous/clumped chromatin 
- low nuc:cyt ratio ballerina skirting with no nucleoli 
blasts = smooth, open, homogenou hcromatic, high nuc;zcyt ratio, prominent nucleoli, auer rod + velvet chromatin 

lymph nodes = normally have b cells in cortex, and then 2ndary have grminal centers where b cells mix with follicular dendritic cells
macrophages will clean it up, 
then the b cells mature and go to the mantle zone lightly outside hte germinal center 

follicular hyperplasia =  b cell prolif , follicles no longer limited to cortex, multiplying in number no longer jsut inthe cortex but spreading
- - have a lot of macrophages in the center. 
- rheumatoid arthritis, syphillis, hiv 
- - intact mantle zones + marginal zones 

mature b cell. lymphoma 
marginal zone lymphomas 
1. MALT lymphomas - extranodal marginal zone lyphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue - unique; but can appear in spleen etc. 
	1.  de novo or with **chronic inflammatory conditions - H pylori + hashimotos, sjogrens syndrome
	2. good prog



interfollicular/paracortical hyperplasia - **t cell prolif, since they live in between b cell nodes,** expanded interfollicular/paracortical areas
- - intact follicles but spaced **far apart**
- - associated w viral infections, post-vaccination, drug rxns, dermatopathic lymphadenitis - skin irritation. 

sinusoidal hyperplasia - most often histiocytes(macrophages/dendritic cells)- lots of pale pink cytoplasm and irregularly shaped cells
- variety of causes, langerhans cell histiocytosis, rosai dorfman dz 

mixed patterns? = we can see granulomas 
- - non-necrotizing granulomas - sarcoidosis + nonspecific rxn to malignancy 
- - necrotizing ganulomas - fungal, tb, cat scratch (henselae) dz , or stellate / serpentine ones are have central neutrophils 

hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. - MAS macrophage activation syndrome - can be lethal -  fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and DIC after a viral infection
- high serum ferritin levels are seen in HLH. 
- "- hyperviscocity syndrome"
- - abnormal rxn to viral or proinflammatory exposure - **huge cytokines -> phagocytosis of normal blood cells!** = widespread inflammation + organ failure. 
- - defect in - **CD8+ and NK cells. can be caused by t cell neoplasms, defects or Xlinked lymphoproliferative disorder XLLPD**
nonspecific symptoms - fever splenomegaly pancytopenia rapidly progressing to DIC/organ failure!
- 
- DX: bone marrow shows hemophagocutosis, high ferritin, hypertriglycerides, high soluble IL-2 receptor

neoplastic
CD 1920s = think Bs 
CD 5,7,4,8 single numbers = think Ts 
Myeloid numbers are in 3s, 13, 30,etc
classic monocytic markers are CD14, 64, 68 
- TdT staining screens for T-cell **lymphoblastic** lymphoma. 
- - Myeloperoxidase stains mark a **myeloid** lineage of cell type. 
- Coombs testing detects antibodies that can cause hemolysis of red cells.
- - Flow cytometry can easily discriminate the clonal CD5, CD23 positive B‐ cells with immunoglobulin light chain restriction of CLL from non‐ neoplastic lymphocytes. 
- platelet glycoproteins CD41, CD61, CD42b 
- RBCs = glycophorin + CD71

mature b cell lymphomas: 
mantle cell lymphoma - overexpressed cyclin D1, from t(11;14) - regulates the prog of cell cycle from g1 to s phase 
- 60 yo male usually 
- **GI mucosal involvement, we see polyps.... lymphomatoid polyposis - little nodules of lymphoma LOOKs like polyps
- 	- aberrant poz - cd5, cyclin-d1, fmc7 
- 	- pertinent neg - cd10 
- lambda restricted profile 
- more aggro than CLL/SLL

higher grade mature b lympomas : 
burkitt lymphoma - high prolif index Ki-67, starry sky from pale macrophags contianing tumor debris = "tingible body macrophages", and (8;14) involve myc ==, poz for CD10== but not CD5 (common in CLL and mantle cell lymphomas)
- large jaw mass endemically 
- sporatically - immunodeficiency like HIV seen 
- very repsonsive to chemo 

mature b cell lymphoma : 
follicular lymphomas - no tingible body macrophages 
normal germinal cells don't express BCL-2 but the follicular one has the mmunoglobulin heavy chain translocated next to it, so it overexpresses + inhibits apoptosis ! 
(14;18), paratrabecular aggregates of CD20+ b cells 
- bcl2 overexpression 
- median age 60 yo 
- - nodular pattern, folliular - **back to back foollicles with expanded germinal centers**
- - prognosis: lower grade = longer survival, but not curable bc mature b cells (not as chemosensitive, harder to eradicate), might prog to difffuse large b cell lymphomas 

normal germinal center b cells + for CD10, negative for bcl-2 

- polycythemia vera (markedly elevated hematocrit, suppressed erythropoietin. Most cases of polycythemia demonstrate a JAK2 mutation. 
- - LAP score measures the activity of alkaline phosphatase in leukocytes;  -> low score= CML, and higher score = leukemoid rxns, which are normal 
-  TRAP stain (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) stains the TRAP enzyme causing the cytoplasm to be red and granular; it is relatively unique to hairy cell leukemia vs. other leukemias.

hairy cell leukemias
- - massive splenomegaly abdominal discomfort
- - **cytopenia/pancytopenia uniquely!** - fatigue + recurrent infections! 
- larger rbc, oval to bean shaped nuclei, disperse chromatin 
- RED pulp spleen expansion + blood lakes 
- - livers - have small lymphocyte clusters in sinuses + portals + blood lakes 
- ==traid of CD11c, CD25, CD103 positives, also cylcin d1 and annexin a1==
- TRAP marker =  red staining in cyt of hairy cells
- ==BRAF mutation!!! activated with downstream mapk, prolif, etc.==

multiple myeloma
rouleaux formation of the RBC's, and the clinical history documents multiple "CRAB" criteria (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions), highly suspicious for plasma cell myeloma. 

AML = auer rods (fused lysosomes!!!) = acute myeloid leukemia 
- 20%+ blasts in periphery or bone marrow.... 
- cytopenias = bone marrow failure, thrombocytopenia (bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses), anemia, neutropenia 
- b symptoms are simply everything else, nonspec - fever night sweats, weight loss, bone pain, splenomeg, hepatomeg
blasts are = larger than lymphoid blasts , nucleolus + cytoplasmic granules seen 
types of AMLs: 
mutations that are bad in AMLs: t(8;21), t(16;16), and t(15;17)
also FLT3 
==mutation that is GOOD in AML: NPM1==
1. acute promyelocytic leukemia - DIC + white count of 150000 - immature wbcs + auer rods
	- t(15;17), if poz, treat with ATRA bc it induces the maturation ; great survival!!!
	- bilobed, butterfly/kidney shaped nuceli 
	- hypergranular form has many cyt and some auer rods, but can also be few and no visible granules/stuff
	- **causes DIC!!!!!!**
	- targets ==PML/RAR fusion protein== = this will block transcription/diff of granulocytes, stopping it from getting mature. 
	-  poz - CD117, CD33, CD13, neg for CD34, HLA-DR
2. monocytic lineage = acute monocytic leukemia= monoblasts are round nuc, visible + prom nucleolis, promonocytes have indented + folded nuc 
	- CD4, CD14, CD64 , they got 4s in them 
	- ==staining for nonspecific esterase==
	- hugely relocated and into the : **GUMS and gingival stuff, huge with extramedullary involvement**
3. acute erythroid leukemia - 30+% are immature rbcs
	- round nuc, agranular basophiliic cytoplasm, some cytoplasmic vacuoles
	- bone marrow has these
	- **pas+, pink stain**
		- ==has glycophorin + CD71 on the surface==
4. acute megakaryoblastic leukemia 
-  ==**associated with down syndrome/trisomy 21**==
-  **cytoplasmic blebs
- pas+ stain
- platelet glycoproteins CD41, CD61, CD42b 

dysplasia in all 3 hematopoietic cells lines = MDS 
- patients with myelodysplastic syndrom high risk of getting acute myeloid leukemia 
- basically in at least 10% of total clls
- develpo in older adults but rare in younger 
- **biallelic TP53 = very bad prognosis**
- - 50-70% of MDS has at least 1 cytogenetic abnormality, **most common loss of 5 or 7 chromosome.** 
- a lot of mutations can show up /: 
- **cytopenias!!! bc they don't make it out the marrow a lot!!!**

classically CML = chronic myeloid leukemia = type of **myeloproliferative disorder** 
-  Left shifted granulocytes indicated the presence of immature ==granulocytes (myeloid lineage==) in the peripheral blood
- predom in adults but can be in kids 
- seen in infections, but a 150,000 white cell count is a leukemic process.
- ==poor prognosis t(9;22), BCR-ABL1 protein, a active tyrosine kinase== 
	- must use imatinib to target this when in blast crisis 
- disease is chronic -> accelerated -> blast phase!!!
- chrnic is <10% blasts, with some dwarf megakaryocytes
- then accerlerated is <20%, we get bone marrow fibrosis 
- blast phase 20+% blasts!!! ): 

mature b cell neoplasm : 
CLL = looks like normal lymphocytes, but you can determine clonality by surface immunoglobulin light chain restriction 
- Expression of CD5 and CD23 on the clonal B-cells is classic for CLL.
- cracked earth snickerdoodle-lik cell 

myeloproliferative neoplasms - ***effective* maturation but low apoptosis**
- marrow has hypercellularity and more myeloid lineages 
- cytosis in periphery 
- point mutations and mutations in tyrosine pathways 
- anti-apoptotic pathways 
- all terminates bone marrow failures...
1. chronic myeloid leukemia 
2. polycythemia vera = inc in rbcs... hyperviscosity related illness
	- platelet dysfunction + pruitis after bathing bc temp = **mast cell degranultion**
	- JAK2 mutation@!!!!
	- 	- bone marrow = **hypercellularity of all 3 cell lines**, no dysplasia (effective normal maturation unlike MDS), iron stores decreased 
	- 	- TREAT: phlembotomy + antithrombotics like aspirin, JAK2 inhibitors too 
	- good survival, but might go to acute myeloid leukemia in 20% of ppl 
3. secondary Polycythemia - chronic pulm/cv dz,  inc carboxyhb with smoking and methb , or resistance at high altitude, or adrenal cortical hypersecretion, tumor making epo, etc
	relative polycythemia - decreased plasma volume, like if you lose lots of fluids, recall ur hematocrit's a ratio, so it'll look bigger
4. essential thrombocythemia - high platelets, giant platelets close to rbc size
	- many asymptomatic but we might see thrombsis/emorrhage 
	- ==- JAK2 mutations + CALR, MPL mutations all jakstat pathway== 
	- spent phase after years and marrow gets fibrotic, but progression happens to acute myeloid leukemia , **but this is lowest risk, <5%

primary myelofibrosis -  prolif of granulocytes and megakaryocytes with depo of fibrosis , 
- some left shift, inc platelets/wbc early on 
- late - cytopenias, **TEAR DROP RBCs**, nucleated rbcs 
- abdominal pain, thrombosis, hemorrhage, splenomegaly 
- JAK2 , CALR, MPL
- 	- prognosis - worse, 3-7 yrs fibrosis, death from bone marrow failure like hemorrhage/infection, 30% get AML

mmature lympoid neoplasms 
B-ALL - b lymphoblastic leukemia  (9;22), **same as CML!!!!**
- common malignancy of kids
- 20+% blsats
- abrupt onset: fatigue, fever, bleeding, prolonged infection, bone pain, CNS involvement (**blasts will go into the nervous system)** 
- has leukocytosis with lymphoblasts - huge - 
- bone marrow - hypercellular, ***sheets*** of lymphoblasts replacing
- morphology - **t and b the same blasts** - intermeiate in size, **very high nuc:cyt ratio!!1 scant agranular cytoplasm, *no auer rods***
- overall good unless younger than 2 or older than 10 

t-all - t lymphoblastic leukemias
- mre common in adolescents ... happens in lymph ndes + marrow
-	- makes mediastinal mass with thymus involvement - 
- ==markers; CD34, TdT imaturity== 
---
- lymphadenopathy/or mass formation - mediastinum, gi tract, and skin.  = these are associated with lymphoid tissue involvement
- - **b cell neoplasms are IDENTICAL - light chain restriction, monotypic, all kappa or all lambda** = they don't have that typical kappa or lambda mix!!!
	- seen in flow cyt 

mature b cell neoplasms
- CLL 
- SLL = small lymphocytic lymphomas - usually male, elderly , combined with lymphadenopathy confined to lymph node
	-  see: **small lymphocytes, scant, agranular cyt, round nuclei, exagerrated heterogenous appearance: SOCCER BALLs, cracked earth appearance.
	-  diffuse effacement of norm lymph node architecture - basically we don't see germinal centers etc folliles, just homogenous mix... sheets of small lymphocytes w same appearance as CLL 
	- 	- core biopsy - **nodular ymphoid aggregates or diffuse sheets of lymphocytes**
	- - usually pertinent poz - CD5/CD23 for the CLL/SLL
	- - pert. negative - CD10, cyclin-D1, FMC7 
	- prognosis good with deletion 13q 
	- prognosis bad with deletion 11, 17p
	- - prognosis very bad when it transforms into large cell diffuse lymphoma ; managed but not cured

high grade b cell lymphoma -
1. lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma - **clonal b lymph with plasmacytic differentiation
- 	- igM is very big, and can stick together - **hyperviscocity of blood**
- 	- visual, neuro impairment, renal dysfunction 
- 	- plasma cells = eccentric nuc + basophilic cytoplasm 
- - splenic - white pulp expansion mostly 
- 	- light chain restriction 
- - **genetics = myd88 mutation!!! - essential to differentiate from marginal zone lymphoma** 
- prognosis - indolent, median survival is 5-10 yrs 


diffuse large b - cell lymphomas - smaller cell ones can transform into this 
- nucleus same size or larger than a macrophage nucleus; 3x the size of normal lymphocytes
- or be d novo, 
- very aggro, rapidly fatal if untreated
-  chemo + rituximab anti CD20 in about 50% of cases treatable - more heterogenous than the small cell b lymphomas

hodgkin lymphoma - of b cell origin 
- full of hodgkin like or HL cells and some reed-sternberg cells - scattered within a bgd of **inflammatory infiltrate - reactive/non-neoplastic**
- 		- HL = large, single nuc, prominent eosinophilic nucleolis 
![[reed-sternberg hodgkin lymphoma.png]]
- 		- **reed-sternberg RS** cells = subtype of hodgkin cell; inclusion like bi/multinuc, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli 
- 		- mummified cell = degenerated HL/RS cell with nucleus appearing **smudgey**
- nodular sclerosis - we have dense fibrotic bands dividing the lymph node into diffuse areas. ; **typically presents with slow growing, painless lymphadenopathy with a mediastinal mass
- favorable prognosis, chemo + rad 

nodular lymphocytes = visually sorta similar to hodgkins but not related
- neoplastic cells = large b cells with multilobated nuclei = has **popcorn cells** + lymphocyte predominant cells .... **constituting a minority of cellular material**  similar to classic hodgkins 
- mediastinal involvement less common than classic hodgkins
- 	- bgd = small lymphocytes. + histiocytes
- 	- prognosis: VERY good esp just one lymph node involved, but recurrence is common 
- 		- RETAIN expression for normal b-cell markers CD20, 79a, 22, pax5, 


plasma cell neoplasms - abnormal plasma cells** = monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance = ==MGUS for <10% of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow== ; prognosis
- good prognosis, low risk of getting myeloma 

multiple myeloma - higher numbers of weird plasma clls.  incurable + hard to treat bc it's mature cells. median survival 3-4 yrs... use chemo +/- stem cell transplant 
- 		- CRAB criteria = need to have multi organ impairment = 		- hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions 
smoldering myeloma -  monoclonal protein, <60% clonal plasma cells in bone marrow/no CRAB criteria
- ==AL amyloid - abnormal amyloid is from the plasma cells which make that abnormal protein, which then are deposited = recall congo red stain apple green== 
wird morphology 
	- large size, prominent nucleolus, multinucleated
	- ducher bodies = intranuclear inclusions 
	- russell bodies - IG containing cytomasmic vesicles
	- mott cell - having too many russell bodies in the cell 
	- "roleaux formation of stacks of coints"
**m spike on SPEP!**

---
mature t cell lymphomas - 
- mycosis fungoides - involve the skin - into epidermis 
	-  erythemitous cutaneous patches then evolving into plaques which inc infiltration with clusters called ==pautrier==
	- cerebriform nuclei = - little brain like cells , = pautrier microabsesses = **collections of malignant cells of epidermis**
	- prognosis depends, need to catch in rash-like stage
- t cell lymphomas - lose expression of normal antigens! while b cells gain antigen expressions
- CD7 commnly lost most likely 

sezary syndrome -=  mycosis fungoides which progresses to systemic involvement 
- triad: erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, sezary cells
	- **abnormal lymphocytes *cerebriform* nuclei WHEN it moves outside of skin1**
- very poor prog

adult T cell leukemia/lymphomas- can overlap 
- - viral association with HTLV-1 virus - south western JP, caribbean, central africa - spread thru blood/sex etc 
- lymphadenopathy, rash, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions 
- high WBC, skin rash, etc. 
- **flower cells!!!! too many lymphocytes in periphery with lymph node effacement + pautrier microabsesses**
- 	- bone marrow - fewer neoplastic cells = but extensive osteoClastic activity = boney breakdown leads to hypercalcemia 
- poor prog
- - pertinent poz = ==CD25 expressed strongly== , HTLV-1; negative CD7 

langerhans cell histiocytosis - LCH = hans-schuller-christian disease
- accessory cells that mainly present antigen to lymphocytes - they have an elongated nuclei with grooves , might be multinucleated, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm,
- ==birbeck granules = granules shaped like tennis rackets in e-microscopy== 
- 	- **acute disseminated LCH - letterer-siwe disease**
- 	- triad = **hand-schuller-christian triad = calvarial bone lesions, diabetes insipidus, exophthalmos**
- - lymph nodes - we see distended **sinuses** filled with langerhans cells + eosinophils
