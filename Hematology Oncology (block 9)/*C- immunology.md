#summary 

all immune receptors - recognize self antigens, which will be **presented by antigen presenting cells with antibodies made by b cells** in the central system 
-  tolerance - **lack of response to antigens** induced by exposure of lymphocytes to these antigens - via the adaptive immune system

tolerance is not immunodeficiency nor is it suppression
**tolerance** -  Antigen specific, property of t/b lymphocytes, and physiologically normal!!!
**immunodef/suppression** - not antigen specific, and can affect both innate/adaptive. can be induced/pathological + reversible. 

central tolerance
- stage 1: central tolerance: primary lymphoid tissue (bone marrow for B-cells, thymus for T cells) 
	- basically apoptosis or receptor b cell change if it retains ability to recognize self antigen 
	- in the thymus of t cells = it is first no cd4/9 -> pre-tcell receptor -> double poz cd4/8 -> weak recognition of MHC 2 and peptide via antigen presenting cells -> deletion of **CD8 receptor becoming poz selection for CD4+ mature T cell** 
	- ==small node - only cd4+ can become t regulatory cells which escape out in the thymus and into periphery in spite of negative selection==
		- no recognition of MHC+ peptide => apoptosis, **death by neglect**... and strong recognition of either -> apoptosis, neg selection
- - weak antigen recognition -> mature t/b cell
- Deletion and receptor editing in response to self-antigen recognition only occurs in bone marrow. 
	- more about receptor editing: immature B-cells are capable of activating unused alleles of Ig light chains when a heavy chain-light chain combination results in a BCR with strong affinity for self antigens
		- reactivate Rag gene to rearrange new light chain formation for new specificity 
	- If a self-reactive B-cell is not deleted by those central tolerance mechanisms and is released into the periphery (circulatory system, or secondary lymphoid tissues), if it encounters **any antigen that crosslinks its antigen receptors** in the ==presence o**f PAMPs or DAMPs (second signal)**== it will be **activated**. -> mechanism of autoimmune disease
		- if central tolerance fails to delete all self reactive lymphocytes they will be activated in periphery when co-stimulatory molecules are expressed in the presence of pamps/damps 


Stage 2: periphery peripheral tolerance in the mature lymphocytes 
- they can become anergic, undergo apoptosis, or the **regulatory t lymphocytes cd4+ earlier can suppress them**
	1. anergy - long lived state f unresponsiveness to antigenic stim in lymphocytes
		- t-reg cells have cell-cell contact with APCs that express CTLA-4 which removes B7 molecules CD80/86 from APC by trans-endocytosis 
			- recall:  induction of co-stim molecules on apc presenting self-antigens; 	- infections -> **rheumatoid arthritis, bc it will alter the proteins in the cell to make them recognized as non-self and elicit adaptive immune responses** 
		- r==ecall that we typically need costim by B7 molecules, so essentially we **take away the costimulatory signal = anergy**==
		- ==alternatively we achieve anergy by using the CTLA-4 binding to eat up the B7 space as a competitive inhibitor== 
			- mutation in CTLA4 = impaired reg t cell function 
	- PD-1 , not expressed on t-regs , ==inhibits any signals from TCR complex + CD28== = taking away that secondary stimulation, so in effector phase = ==**signaling inhibitor; *peripheral tissues!!!***. CD8>CD4+== 
	1. . activation induced cell death -  peripheral t cell deletion = AICD... this is in absence of low/no costimulators, **no IL-2 so we have death, since IL-2 is typically an inhibitor of the apoptotic proteins**
		1. FAS: autoimmmune lymphoproliferative syndrome alps; defective apoptosis of self reactive t and b cells of **periphery
	2. tolerance = in periphery due to **AIRE** - if we mutate htis we have APS, causing defective elimination of self reactive t cells 

B cells in periphery 
- anergy happens due to no t cells 
- apoptosis - triggered by self antigens in periphery, happens with newly emerged transitional b cells
	- FAS: autoimmmune lymphoproliferative syndrome alps; defective apoptosis of self reactive t and b cells of **periphery

CTLA-4 is a checkpoint inhibition molecule expressed by T-cells only (CTL is in the name - so easy to remember)
- expression is **induced on T-cells after activation** by **antigen (effector T-cells)**, so it acts in the ***periphery***. 
- is also expressed constitutively on Tregs, which are an effector of peripheral tolerance.

CD4+ marker
- TH1, TH2(b cell recruited to make antibody mediated) and Tregs 
- diet/autoimmunity - some debates - Vita D - decrease that Th1 cell responses + inc T reg 
		- celiac dz - autoimmune dz triggered by glutin in ppl , igA autoantibodies
		- iodine - excess - inc iodinization of thyroglobulin - more immunogenic 

IFN-gamma
- marker of TH1 cells

FoxP3 is a transcription factor unique to Tregs
- also expression of CD25 is high for Tregs   - they make cytokines that block macroophage activation: IL-10, TGF-b... but they also deplete IL-2 and other inflammatory cytokines TNF+ IL1 
- mutation in FoxP3 =  X-linked polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy (IPEX). 

Nod2 = Crohns disease, Blau syndrome. It encodes a protein expressed in monocytes, macrophage, dendritic cells and some intestinal epithelial cells that activates NF-kappaB in response to bacterial PAMPS - 

immune privilege - don't have self antigens that are in these areas, so thre's no activation there; includes brain, eyes, testes, placenta/fetus 
- The fetus is normally protected by passive and active immune privilege such that the mother's immune system is not exposed to fetal antigens via the placenta during pregnancy
- breakdown of this privilege -> how we get Rh+ moms 
- abundance of t-regs or physical separation from intestines/cutaneous immune systems like mucus, etc. keratin in skin protects our microbiome and all that 

PD-1 binding to PD-L1 or B7 on APC is primarily a mechanism producing **anergy** in effector T-cells in peripheral tissues, including tumors.

Bystander activation or epitope spreading
- autoreactivity can lead to tissue injury + subsequent immune responses to additional antigens 

IL-10 mutations - infantile enterocolitis, defective suppression of immune responses to commensal bacteria

## Highlights for -HRR Introduction to Clinical Immunological Tests_Litwin
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR and CRP = very sensitive but not specific, they're just acute phase reactants and can be elevated in many diseases[^15]
	- ESR - how fast RSCs settle to bottom of tube in 1 hr? faster it settles = higher the ESR. so acute phase reactants would negate that charge and make cells sequester.[^15]
- Measure - C3 - classic + alt pathways[^15]
- Measure - C4 - classic pathway only[^15]
	- Activations of complement cascade, C3/4 decreases with complement activation secondary to immune complex disease bc it gets cleaved[^15]

Rheumatoid factor - typically IgM against Fc portion of igG[^15]
- Not specific, and can interfere with ELISA testing[^15]
- Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide Anti-CCP wayyy better for rheumatoid arthritis[^15]

Connective tissue diseases - anti nuclear antibody testing - antibodies to specific parts of nucleus of cell[^15]
- Cytoplasmic/nucleolar pattern - SLE[^15]
- Speckled pattern - the most nonspecific, can be caused by infections too[^15]

ANA - antinuclear antibody[^15]
- Anti-DNA antibodies/anti-histone - seen in drug induced lupus[^15]
- Nucleolar pattern - systemic scleroderma[^15]
- Centromere pattern - CREST/limited variant of scleroderma[^15]
Extractable nuclear antigens ENAs - can be done with the ANA, coat cells with extractable nuclei and extract all separate parts of nucleus[^15]

ANCA - anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies - mostly for any ANCA-associated vasculitis[^15]
- If there's renal dysfunction in patient - do this stat.[^15]
- P-ANCA = lobulated nucleus, perinuclear - myeloperoxidase is seen[^15] = *eosinophilic* granulomatosis w/ polyangiitis + microscopic polyangiitis 
- C-ANCA - cytoplasmic dye around the cytoplasm ; proteinase 3 is there[^15] - granulomatosis with polyangiitis 

False poz test for syphilis due to anticardiolipin, associated with 1/2 of SLE[^15]
- Antiphospholipid syndrome- women lose many pregnancies due to abortions - this is the cause, venous and/or arterial thromboses[^15]

SPEP patterns[^15]
- 1st peak = albumin, 2nd = alpha -1, 3rd alpha-2, 4th peak = b-globulin(complement, fibrinogens, clotting etc) , 5th peak is gamma (immunoglobulins)[^15]
- Alpha 2 inc when gamma's not = acute inflammatory[^15]
- Chronic inflammatory - when gamma starts to increase too bc this time you're making antibodies[^15]
- Monoclonal proteins - found in multiple myeloma - sharp peak seen[^15]
- Nephrotic syndromes + losing enteropathy - see a decrease in proteins[^15]
- Immunofixation - used to determine the actual composition of the monoclonal spike[^15]

TB tests 
- Type 4 hypersensitivity = tuberculin skin test - t cells - skin test , 2-3 days to see rxn[^15]
	- PPD - crude protein used to detect the tb.[^15]
	- False poz to bcg, some immune reactivity to non tb mycobacteria ntms[^15]
- IGRAs[^15]
	- We isolate the t cells and check for memory t cell responsiveness to release gamma interferon[^15]
	- Specific for tb- these are not false poz.[^15]
	- QFT -[^15]
		- Neg control - look for bgd IFN-g, bc u can have that with uncontrolled hiv etc.[^15]
		- Incubate whole blood overnight. add the antigens - wait for them to make interferon-g.[^15]
		- Typical poz - NIL low (normal ppl have big response to mitogen) ; then subtract the TB Ag - Nil = more than 10 basically[^15]
		- Typical neg - low nil, tb ag low , mitogen 10+[^15]
		- Indeteminant - if Nil high, may be due to recent illness[^15]

Alternate test - T-spot, count the dots[^15]
Collect blood mononuclear cells , add these to a big titer well, then it's coated with IFN-g receptors[^15]

liver transplant 
orthotopic operation - same place as native organ, remove that old one and place in the new one 
kidney transplant - **heterotopic** - **the kidney goes into the pelvis instead of the native position** 
pancreas - midline incision, retract the intestines up, and then sew pancreas to the common iliac a + vena cava 

liver = less immune reactive than < kidney < heart - we measure genetic disparity looking at the HLA profile 
	transplant immunology - what mechanism does **alloreactive/rejection** occur? 

**acute** rejection is a - t cell mediated b cell response = primary mechanism ; this happens within the YEAR ; this is an adaptive immune system phenomenon! 
- this is type II and iV , mediated by t cells ; CD8+ kills graft cells directly and CD4+ make cytokines + induce inflammation 
1. antigen presentation - recipient blood -> transplanted organ, with the blood, the APCs and T cells of the recipient enters to interact directly 
	- direct pathway: APC of DONOR has HLA/peptide complex presented to the TCR of the T cells in recipient; i, the donor, take part of myself to show you, the recipient t cell, if i pass the vibe check directly. 
	- indirect:  APC of recipient presents **donor antigen** to their own recipient T cells - i took a piece of the donated! 
	- semidirect: endocytosis of donor HLA, inside the recipient's APC , so we now have the donor's HLA peptide complex on the surface. but the recipient's APC still presents to the recipient t cells. 
		- basically I absorbed the scaffolding from the donated and then use it on my surface to present it to myself!
2. TCR binding  with T helper cell activation, binding that antigen in the context of mhc
3. costimulation
4. clonal proliferation of t cell via IL-2 -> Th1 => acute rejection .... making of t cells more!!!
5. B cell activation, via t cells binding the MHC on the b cell, activating it.
6. 1. antibody production by the B cells = antibodies direct towards antigen of the donor that was recognized by the t cells
7. ab-mediated complement activation pathway

chronic rejection by memory cells, fibrotic changes and huge histo changes, slow ;; can happen past a year 
obliterative lesions in all solid organ transplants = vascular lesions in all transplant grps, organ specific obliterative lesions like the obliterative bronchiolitis in lung or vanishing bile duct in liver 
- - chronic inflammatory rxn - **walls of vessels get more and more thick, will close up the lumena, causing ischemia/occlusion** -> arteriosclerosis !!! endothelial injury + parenchyma **fibrosis**
- you see some new glomerular membrane, like reduplication of the **basement membrane + fibrosis of tubular interstitium**

- hyperacute rejection = when all the bullets are ALREADY out of the gun. minutes to hours; **non-treatable and pre-formed antibody**. very uncommon here, esp since we try to do crossmatching 
	-  type 2 = antibody mediated, antibodies against tissue/cells = **hyperacute!!!, pre-formed antibodies that are already in recipient, EX) abo blood groups**
	- preformed antibody -> complement activation -> neutrophil margination -> inflammation -> thrombus ; ghosted and pale glomerulus 

transplant drugs; [[*C -Pharm]] - mainly what's on it 
1. induction therapy - 
	1. t cell depletion - stop the first step, maintain the low level of activity  
	- t cell blocking 
	- b cell depletions 
	- steroid 
2. maintenance therapy 
	1. ==calcineurin inhibitor== = workhorse agent for transplant rejection - basically this will be tacrolimus** - maintenance immunosuppression 
		1. most of the AE: kidney failures 
	2. antimetabolites
	- steroids
	- **costimulatory blockade- belatacept - does NOT have nephrotoxicity**, can be used instead of tacrolimus/other calcineurin inhibitors - but rate of rejection is higher  
	- mTOR inhibitors 
3. salvage therapy 
	1. steroids
	2. t cell agents
	3. b cell agents
"allotolerance - teaching ur organs to accept non-self"
- **adding the t cell components of the donor to the recipient**

immune response to transplants - get a big picture look 0: 
 - autologous - graft in same person from one part to the other
- syngeneic - identical twins isograft
- allogeneic - allograft, diff member of same species 
- xenogeneic - xenograft - one species to another 

rejection - t cells + antibodies made against antigens react and destroy - huge thing is HLA proteins as the main thing 
- this is memory specific + lymphocyte mediated which points to adaptive phenomenon 

alloantigens - HLA MHC molecules are what we try to match for. 
- - **HLA genes are highly polymorphic, always some differences unless they're Identical twins** 
	- bone marrow transplantation - requires match, but a slightly incomplete match generates **graft vs leukemia, which is therapeutic effect of incomplete match
		- we lowkey WANT a bit of diversion for graft vs. leukemia effect!!!
	- but in solid organ transplant, kidneys we need it to match exctly. 
- - heart and lungs = matched on size, blood group + gender. such rare organs. 

hematopoietic stem cell transplant - to treat hematopoietic malignancies, aplastic anemia or immunodiff
- - HLA matching - match as much as we can, at least 6/8 HLA = recall: **curative basis for this is graft vs leukemia!!!**
- - radiation blasting **recipient** to destroy their immune system - basically injecting them full of cells that aren't their own to make sure they repopulation 
	- we want to prevent graft vs host dz, where the donate t cells's  attack the recipient's t cells!!! = a huge issue with allogenetic transplants 
	- can be acute or chronic 
	- 	- **jaundice, rash, diarrhea; liver, skin, GI tract** 

in kidneys if there is acute rejection
- tubulointerstitial = busy and full of inflammation + dark cells with halos , filled with t cells!!! 
	vascular inflammation = lymphocytes are inside the vessels, completely occluded. automatically highest degree of rejection to have. 
		- TREAT: with corticosteroids + antithymocyte globulin at higher rate aggro infection 

antibody mediated rejection 
- paired up with complement activation usually 
- circulating anti-graft antibodies - donor specific antibodies called DSA 
		- presence of intra-graft deposition of complement *C4d* = **a complement split product after activation!!! in response to vascular damage, it will be along the capillaries
- you get capillaritis, microvascular inflammation involving glomeruli severely 
- C4d split product from the C4 is without known biological function = it's a highly stable covalent bond and **remains bound like a footprint to the vessel walls while the antibodies that were on the walls disappear over time**
	- so this C4d is a stain = due to its adhesion, a **marker!!! to indicate complement attack**
	- 	- both ab and cellular mediated rejection = presenting same way clinically with fever or tenderness over graft + inc creatinine

response to tumors 
emerging hallmarks - deregulation of cellular energetic, avoid immune destruction, tumor promoting inflammation 

microenvironment and a micro-organ = the tumor 
- cancer stem cells - few of these, very crucial for tumor regrowth even if all cancer cells are murked
- - cancer associated fibroblasts - crosstalk between fibroblasts + cancer cells 
- immune inflammatory cells - promote the tumor 
- endothelial cells 

tumors can exist without disease, like 1/3+ women have in situ tumors in breast, but actual cancers are 1%... **meaning immune system holds it at bay**. 
	- **cancer immunosurveillance - huge host protection**
	- **adaptive immunity against it** ; like immune responses against tumors inhibit the tumor growth. 
	- also u can transfer immune arm onto another to prevent tumors, transfer the lymphocytes 
- 	- immunodeficient ppl have a higher rate of some tumors 
- 	- **immune checkpoint inhibitors of PD-1 and CTLA-4 = blocking these lead to tumor remission**

TSA: tumor-specific antigens = proteins only expressed by tumors
tumor ASSOCIATED antigens - normal cell hve it but **overexpressed** in tumor cells 
- - CTAG cancer testis antigen = tissue differentiation, and MAGE - melanoma associated antigen 
- - overexpressed proteins - like tyrosinase during cancer, happen = malignant melanoma 
- - oncofetal: AFP/CEA = produced during development, but not made when immune system develops "shouldn't be seen in an adult"
	- AFP = germ cell tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma 
	- CEA = bowel cancers , occasionally lung/breast

how t cells do it 
- mutated self protein -> will be recognized by t cells as foreign
- mutated oncogene / mutated tumor suppressor gene = TSAs! 
	-  Ras/Bcr/Abl fusion = all proto-oncogenes
	- tumor suppressors = p53 (this will be lost)

- or there's oncogenic viruses = HPV/EBV,  activation latent viral DNA 

tumor rejection immune mechanisms 
 1. t cell receptor will recognize the peptide in the MHC 
2. costimulation via ==CD28==, OX40, 4-1BB etc (these depend on the tissue)
3. ==cytokines==, by the CD4+ helper T cells, which help the **CD8+ t cell clonally expand, which will now see and recognize the tumor and kill them all

elimination of tumor cells - CD8+ cytotoxic granules
- - ==death ligand expression = where FasL and TRAIL== can **activate extrinsic apoptosis program , binding to death receptors on target cell**

but cancerls can evade this!!! immunoediting in phases:
1. 1. phase 1 elimination - everything works, all the crosspresentation etc... everything above works, so the tumor growth < cell death... so we don't even know there was a tumor 
2. equilibrium phase 2 = tumor cell VARIANTS survive, evade
	- tumors antagonize the th1 response (cell mediated immunity) but genetic instability they mutate still
	- evasion works by 
		- - tumor cell can just not display that peptide anymore
		- or not display MHC 1 
		- most commonly: **tumor makes inhibitory ligand, telling t cell to shut down** -> expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells 
		- of have IL-23 = making CD4+ proinflammatory, promoting a tumor 
		- TGF-b = gives you t-reg cells which will make tumor progress by suppressing the CD8+ 
		- IL-4 can make the cell mediated stuff shut up and do antibody response instead, **and antibodies aren't that effective against tumors, not helpful
tumor
