high yield + important drugs - 
AEs of bleeding for nearly all of them - serious considerations and monitoring 
platelet drugs, anticoagulants and then anti-fibrolitics 
- antiplatelets - COX inhibitors, P2y12 antag, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, cAMP PDE inhibitors
- anticoagulants - heparins, vita K antagonists, factor 10a inhibitors, factor 2a inhibitors
- thrombolytics 
- reversal agents - note that these can be used instead of these specific drugs = agent of circumstance. you can pick any pretty much 
- antifibolytic drugs 
abnormal  coagulation - see venous thrombosis DVT - pretty common, basically venous valves are common - see turgidity/low flow , associated pathology of platelet+RBC coagulation , red thrombsis
arterial thrombosis - irregularities on endothelial lining - atherosclerotic plaques = foci for platelet aggregation = **white thrombis** = stroke + heart attack/MI = there's anti-platelets of preventive measures. extra risk in prosthetic heart valves precipitating clots. also a-fib, and knee/hip replacement surgeries. 

platelet phase - they adhere to subendothelial factors exposed by trauma .... including vWF and collagen. adhesion mediated by GPIa/IIa + GPIb
adhesion + activation => feed forward activation loop, more and more granules and ADP from platelets will cause more and more platelets to aggregate. any time you see P2y = think gpcrs that bind to ADPs, that can bind together. 
- p2y1 and p2y12 = purogenic receptors that ADP binds to => **stimulates GPIIb/IIIa receptors** = binds to fibrinogen, causes platelet adherence to each other in 2ndary plug + stimulates COX1 = releases thromboxane A2 TXA2 to aggregate platelets. 
- COX1 stimulation also happens with collagen interaction with its receptor 
- ca2+ released from granules = cofactor for many proteases in coagulation cascade - linking platelet + coag phases to make poz feedback loop 
- PAR1/4 = protease activated receptors = GPCRs *activated by thrombin factor 2a* in cascade... like Ca2+ , provides link between platelet + coagulation phases, making a poz feedback loop! = > **permenantly activated!**
	- just focus on the drug targets
- PGI2 = prostaglandin made by endothelial cells' COX2 to inhibit platelet aggregation 

aspirin - ASA = MOA: **irreversible inhib of cox1 and cox2**
- major cox product in platelets is TXA2... inducer of platelet agg+vasoconstriction 
- by inhibiting this, we can't activate more platelets. min amount is 75 mg daily. lower dose bc irreversible covalent! common to use with **another antiplatelet therapy = dual antiplatelet therapy DAPT = like p2y12 adp receptors**
	- mainly after surgeries and stuff 
- prevention = stroke + MI in at risk pts, Acute coronary syndrome + ppl who get prosthetic heart pieces!
- AEs: GI upset bc of blocking PGI2 in gut, which usually helps balance out the histamine responses but can't anymore... might make an ulcer. also bleeding risk + REYE syndrome in 20 yrs and lower kids 

P2Y12 antag = xyz-grel 
- clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrel-or
- ADP meant to bind to p2y12.... will then couple to Gi, which lowers cAMP,
	- ==recall: cAMP **inhibits platelet activation**.... ADP binding p2y12 so lowering it could cause cAMP to go down, which activates the platelets more== 
- clopidogrel - irreversible inhibitor of p2y12 receptor - **prodrug requires activation via CYP 2c19 in the liver**
	- note prevalent polymorphisms in 2C19 gene in general population = some don't benefit from clopidogrel, resistance there, so they may be inadequately protected. 
	- to prevent rate of stroke, MI and death in pts with **a recent hx of these**
	- most often combo'd with asa after coronary stent in DAPT
	- AEs - inc bleeding risk, TTP = **thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal dysfunction which can be life-threatening but rare. helped with plasma.**
	- interactions - with PPIs, which are **CYP 2C19 inhibitors!**
- prasugrel - irreversible inhib, also a prodrug
	- **stronger more efficient + rapid action version of clopidogrel = but more bleeding risk!**
	- more for pts who are **undergoing stenting**... ACS, better drug but more bleeding. 
	- CI in ppl 75+ yo bc of that 
- ticagrelor - **reversible inhibitor of P2Y12**
	- reduction of risk in MI, stroke, ACS or hx of myocardial. 
	- more potent than clopidogrel, but this is more expensive bc it's on-patent. 
	- AEs; ***dyspnea* , CI in pts with prior intracranial bleeding**

GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors - recall that this is to **bind to fibrinogen to crosslink platelets together**
- eptifibatide - use of these inhibitors declined with more potent p2y12 inhibitors 
	- cyclic peptide inhibitor of fibrinogen binding site on GPIIb/IIIa
	- use as **iv infusion during percutaneous intervention/stenting**
	- AE bleeding and thrombocytopenia, no longer in use

cAMP PDE inhibitors
- dipyridamole, cilostazol
- recall: cAMP suppresses platelet activation, so by consuming cAMP, we would .
