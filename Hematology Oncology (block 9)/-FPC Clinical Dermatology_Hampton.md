special senquanon - every dz has 3 feat that make it synchroonous and that's it and nothing else 
learn the verbage from the phone when consulting derm
recall: 
- make sure you memorize "BUZZWORDS"
==primary lesions - original lesion== 
- ==macule, flat like a mole(<1.0 cm) =>>>> patch (1.0+)==
- ==papule, solid and firm, **raised, dome shaped**!!!! (<1.0 cm); and then plaque(1+ cm)==, like contact derm or skin cancer , ==but this is **flat top lesion**==
- ==vesicle- clear fluid filled (<1.0 cm) ->>> bullae (1+ cm)==
	- take a q tip and hit the vesicle to get fluid out  
- ==nodule (>1.0 cm), very firm; epidermal/derma/SQ ; **dome shaped**->>> tumor (2+ cm), this is elevated/deep-seated or pedunculated==
- ==pustule - same like vesicle but neutrophil/pus-filled, <1 cm== 
- ==wheal = hive = urticaria = serous fluid coming out of blood vessels into the interstitium, causing swelling!!==
	- "washed out" = evanescent
	- ==variable blanching !!! bgd erethema==

==secondary lesions== - result of extraneous factor like trauma; ==**what happens to the primary that you see**== 
- ==scale - dead epidermal cells that don't slough off.== 
- ==crust- scab of dead cells + serum , like adding some **fluid** to the scale!== 
- ==erosion - loss of epidermis, no penetration of dermal epidermal junction meaning no scarring== 
- ==ulceration - a deep ulcer loss of epidermis going thru **Dermal epidermal junction** = scarring!== 
- ==fissure = fine split/crack in skin==, like eczema craquele
- ==excoriation = focal shallow erosion with **scale and crust** sticking to it , like skin digging==  
- ==scar = new CT that replaces lost substance in dermis or subq, **inflammation** replacement with scar tissue==  

doing a derm exam
- skin
- mucous membrane
- appendages
- hair
- nails 

---
==most important = DISTRIBUTION==
- diffuse/widespread = think viral exanthem 
- photodistributed = photodermatitis , v neck area and arms 
==configuration== 
- ==linear = poison ivy== 
- ==annular = oval , granuloma annulare not uncommon on hands + feet==
- ==grouped = vesicles on a pink base think HSV==
- ==serpiginous - creeping/snakelike, cutaneous larva migrans on feet== 
---
derm hx + derm exam = definitive dx (what we mostly explains what im seeing)
- DD = what else can it be 
- we do the exam first!!! yes you can fall into a biopsy in case but those are expensive. 
how can we think? 
- put it into primary lesion groups, with descriptors such as "white brown atrophic, dermal, inflammatory, grouped, palpable purpura, telangiectasias, rolled borders etc" - hard to do for our mind
- regional groups - by distribution, hands and feed, scalps and stuff?
- special clinical groups - like thinking of vesiculopustules in newborns, in pregnancy, generalized itching with / without a rash 
- we do it based on morphology: these are the basics!!! - stuff like - learn the dx and look up the treatment later. hard part is the dx 
	- papulosquamous dz
	- eczematous dermatitis
	- vesiculobullous dz
	- acneiform eruptions
	- morbiliform eruptions
	- disorders of pigmentation 

1. ==papulosquamous dz = papules + scales , most common== 
	1. ==Psoriasis (prototype)==  very common 2% of population
		- ==scalp/elbows, knees palms, soles==
		- **==symmetrical== = one side matches the others**
		- ==**very well-circumscribed borders==, so the pen marks surrounding it- which is what separates it from eczema**
		- ==silver scale rather than greasy scale== like in seborrheic dermatitis 
		- caused by: ==family hx, **drug induced b-blocker/lithium**, idiopathic== 
		- ==nail pits, notches in nails + **koebner phenomenon - new lesions appearing on healthy skin after injury or trauma**==
	2. ==Seborrheic dermatitis == 
		- ==scalp/ears/mid-chest/central face - **loves the eyebrows, nasolabial folds, glabella(skin between eyebrows)**==
		- ==greasy scaley and pink !== 
		- ==bimodal== skin dz = show up ==at birth "cradle cap", then only after 40== yrs old 
			- if younger than that check for HIV 
	3. ==Tinea versicolor == 
		- ==very flat but raised papules still!==
		- ==trunk/upper extremities==
		- ==light/very brown, versatile, flat scale== 
		- ==spaghetti + meatballs = both spores and hyphae!!! pitrysporum ovale.== looks like a hybrid fungus - **both spores and hyphae** : **pitrysporum ovale**
	4. ==Secondary syphilis == 
		- ==trunk/palms/soles==
		- young mostly , ==non-pruritic== 
		- =='ham spots' = papules that are scaley, contagious and loaded with spirochetes!==
	5. ==Candida *intertrigo* == 
		- ==body folds==
		- very ==painful== - trigger ==complement system==
		- ==**bright red, satellite pinpoint papules/pustules**==
	6. ==Tinea capitis/corporis/cruris/pedis == 
		- fungal infection due to **==dermatophytes==** - gonna be ==thin pencil like breaking into a branch (microsporum, trichophyton, epidermophyton)==
		- scalp = capitis
		- body = corporis
		- ==groin = cruris== 
		- feet = pedis "dry feet"
	7. ==Pityriasis rosea   more history - driven+seasonal== 
		- ==trunk/upper extremities==
		- ==initial = herald patch, like ringworm; pruritic== 
		- ==7-14 days later burst of lesions all over the body "salmon-colored" ovale papules with a collarette of scales trailing; Christmas tree==
		- looks like a Christmas tree - in fall, winter, spring ;; will go thru the world 
		- very pruritic, ==12 wks resolved, slow resolving== 
	8. ==Lichen planus==
		- ==oral cavity has wickham's striae, on volar wrist, male genitalia + lower back, whiteish streak== 
		- ==flat topped, violaceous, polygonal pruritic papules "Polygonal" - big and small different sizes==, flat"
		- ==koebner phenomenon== - similar to psoriasis, wherever you have trauma or scratching, lesions develop 
2. ==eczematous dermatitis== - different morhpological groups = **please do derm rotation!** , we see "oozy weepy a lot", in comparison to psoriasis
	- ==erythematous  / red==
	- ==ill defined borders==
	- ==acute phase is oozey weepy -> use cream==
	- ==later become dry + scaley (chronic) = use ointment== 
	- contact derm
		- ==contact derm: irritant vs allergic==
		1. ==irritant = no memory t cells, you get the rash, then if you get exposed to same thing, no more rash like diaper stuff==
		2. ==allergic = memory t cells like poison ivy, you get it again and again== 
	- ==noncontact derm: atopic(allergy-causing), nonatopic groups==
		1. ==atopic dermatitis = on **face with sparing the center**. eventually ends up on extremities==
			- this affects many ==children== as early as 6 wks
			- ==hx of asthma, hay fever in pt or in family== 
			- look for ==**dennie-morgan folds beneath eye, hyperlinear palms - extra lines in the palms, or inc IgE**==
		- ==nonatopic derm: lichen simplex chronicus, dyshidrotic eczema, stasis dermatitis, nummular eczema==
			1. ==lichen simplex chronicus== - ankle/nape of neck, very localized + pruritic, you ==**rub and rub, inc the skin lines = lichenified!!! chronic + ongoing**==
				- inciting incident ==usually bug bite== 
			2. ==dyshidrotic eczema - pompholyx, recurrent **crops of vesicles, usually on digits+feet**==
				- ==hx of hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating==, usually worsen in summer 
			3. ==stasis derm== - from everybody 
				- on ==lower extremities, from leg swelling + occlusion of lymphatics = sclerosis of small BVs== 
				- you get oozy eczema and later hyperpigmentation of yellow-brown 
				- ==purutic = **bilateral!!!**==
				- etiology - idk but there's ==venous insufficiency, knee surgery, or drug induced , or CHF, pulm htn== etc. 
			4.  ==nummular eczema== 
				- basically ==anywhere - "super dry skin"==
				- ==coin shaped plaques==, oozy weepy and later dry and scaley 
				- give steroid + moisturizer 

3. ==vesiculobullous dz==
	1. ==erythema multiforme==
		- ==minor== - in ==kids, pink/light pink of "target/iris lesions" = on palms/soles==
		- ==major. =stevens-johnson syndrome = now with mucosal membranes, usually adults== and some kids 
		- ==TEN - toxic epidermal necrolysis - like when you burn ur skin off, 50% mortality== 
			- all internal organ mucosal linings sloughing off, like you die actually, 3rd degree burns in and out 
			- from drugs
	2. ==bullous pemphigoid - tense blister==, if it's a blister that stays 
	3. ==pemphigus vulgaris - flaccid blisters== - if it breaks down very easily 
4. ==acneiform eruptions ==- acne is the basic, with 
	1. ==prototype acne vulgaris; all ages==  - everything else is not acne but look like acne 
		- ==face/chest/**upper** back/shoulder , so upper parts of body== 
		- newborn - adulthood , all throughout  
		- ==hair follicule occlusion -> bacteria -> **comedone(whitehead/blackheads)/papule(adding in the bacteria)/pustule/nodule(rupture below the skin)/cyst**==
		- ==treatable, not curable==. this is ==multifactoral== but this is genetics mostly , family hx, and oily environment. stress plays roles too 
	2. ==rosacea-==  
		- ==**central face**!! red, conjunctiva, ocular rosacea== 
			- conjunctiva = ocular rosacea 
		- no comedones = no whitehead/backheads
		- **==hereditary + blush easily etc. in ADULTs**==
		- many ==triggers like sun, spicy foods, red wine, blood vessels open; treatable but not curable==
		- ==**rhinophyma - end stage rosacea, lumpy bumpy + very oily if not treated**==
	3. ==perioral dermatitis POD== 
		- this is just ==rosacea but **in the lower face!!**==
		- same triggers etc 
		- ==**hx of sensitive skin , make sure you use chem free sunscreens**==
	4. ==steroid acne== 
		- ==**upper trunk , not the face**; sudden eruption + hard to treat and up to a year to get better==
		- sudden eruption + hard to treat and up to a year to get better. 
		- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6793974/ - careful with this bc steroid psychosis 
5. ==morbiliform eruptions - measle-like, penicillin like, little reddish flat things surrounded by normal skin== 
	- ==neck, trunk, extermities - **bilateral/symmetrical**==
	- 1-3 cm lesions surrounded by normal skin 
	- exanthem!!! 
	- ==viral cause, and drug induced mainly== (antibiotics, allopurinol, anti-epileptic, nsaids, herbal/natural therapies) - ==onset in 1-2 wks, and then if re-exposed, 1-3 days== bc these are memorized 

6. ==disorders of pigmentation== 
	1. ==melasma - central face, and sun-exposed.== 
		- 'mask of pregnancy - ==seen in pregnant women'==
		- ==hyperpigmented little patches grouped together== 
		- genetic, hormone, sun exposure, meds - ==prevent tis with sunscreen basically !== 
	 2. ==vitilligo - face/trunk/extremities==
		- ==bilateral==
		- ==symmetrical==
		- ==depigmented macules/patches==
		- seen mainly in darker skin groups
		- ==**check for other autoimmune dz = hashimoto's, graves, pernicious anemia**==
	3. ==postinflammatory pigment alteration PIPA or postinflammatory hyper/hypopigmentation PIH== 
		- ==anywhere, totally from hx of inflammatory event, skin trauma, acne, etc== 
		- ==hyper/hypopigmented macules/patches -> **uneven tone**==

biopsy - to confirm dx and not make the dx

random information about sunscreen, not on test 
- chem sunscreens - active ingredient = will be benzones, etc etc = only working for hours 2-4 hrs twice a day in the afternoon too , not waterproof
- zinc bases = mineral sunscreens = waterproof 6-8 hrs, it stays 
	- 5-24% , if they're super white, good to have 10+%
	- only outdoor light 
- tinted white = are better- has iron oxide, which is blocking both in and outdoor light , put on thin layer 
- spray ons - must rub it in !!! 
- sunscreen sticks - good for kids 
- lip sunscreens cancer on lip - 5.5% zinc etc
