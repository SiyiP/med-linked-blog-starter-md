special senquanon - eveyr dz has 3 feat that make it synchroonous and that's it and nothing else 
learn the verbage from the phone when consulting derm
recall: 
- make sure you memorize "BUZZWORDS"
primary lesions - original lesion 
- macule, flat like a mole(<1.0 cm) =>>>> patch (1.0+)
- papule, solid and firm, **raised**!!!! (<1.0 cm)-?>>> plaque(1+ cm), like contact derm or skin cancer 
- vesicle- clear fluid filled (<1.0 cm) ->>> bulla (1+ cm)
	- take a q tip and hit the vesicle to get fluid out  
- nodule (>1.0 cm), very firm; epidermal/derma/SQ ->>> tumor (2+ cm), this is elevated/deep-seated or pedunculated
- pustule - same like vesicle but neutrophil/pus-filled, <1 cm 
- wheal = hive = urticaria = serous fluid coming out of blood vessels into the interstitium, causing swelling!!
	- "washed out" = evanescent

secondary lesions - result of extraneous factor like trauma; **what happens to the primary that you see** 
- scale - dead epidermal cells that don't slough off. 
- crust- scab of dead cells + serum , like adding some fluid to the scale! 
- erosion - loss of epidermis, no penetration of dermal epidermal junction meaning no scarring 
- ulceration - a deep ulcer loss of epidermis going thru Dermal epidermal junction = scarring! 
- fissure = fine split/crack in skin, like eczema craquele
- excoriation = focal shallow erosion with scale and crust sticking to it , like skin digging  
- scar = new CT that replaces lost substance in dermis or subq, **inflammation** replacement with scar tissue  

doing a derm exam
- skin
- mucous membrane
- appendages
- hair
- nails 

---
most important = DISTRIBUTION
- diffuse/widespread = think viral exanthem 
- photodistributed = photodermatitis , v neck area and arms 
configuration 
- linear = poison ivy 
- annular = oval , granuloma annulare not uncommon on hands + feet
- grouped = vesicles on a pink base think HSV
- serpiginous - creeping/snakelike, cutaneous larva migrans on feet 
---
derm hx + derm exam = definitive dx (what we mostly explains what im seeing)
- DD = what else can it be 
- we do the exam first!!! yes you can fall into a biopsy in case but those are expensive. 
how can we think? 
- put it into primary lesion groups, with descriptors such as "white brown atrophic, dermal, inflammatory, grouped, palpable purpura, telangiectasias, rolled borders etc" - hard to do for our mind
- regional groups - by distribution, hands and feed, scalps and stuff?
- special clinical groups - like thinking of vesiculopustules in newborns, in pregnancy, generalized itching with / without a rash 
- we do it based on morphology: these are the basics!!! - stuff like - learn the dx and look up the treatment later. hard part is the dx 
	- papulosquamous dz
	- eczematous dermatitis
	- vesiculobullous dz
	- acneiform eruptions
	- morbiliform eruptions
	- disorders of pigmentation 

1. papulosquamous dz = papules + scales , most common 
	1. Psoriasis (prototype)  very common 2% of population
		- scalp/elbows, knees palms, soles
		- **symmetrical = one side macthes the others**
		- **very well-circumscribed borders, so the pen marks surrounding it- which is what separates it from eczema**
		- silver scale rather than greasy scale like in seborrheic dermatitis 
		- caused by: family hx, **drug induced b-blocker/lithium**, idiopathic 
		- nail pits, notches in nails + **koebner phenomenon - new lesions appearing on healthy skin after injury or trauma**
	2. Seborrheic dermatitis  
		- scalp/ears/midchest/central fact - **loves the eyebrows, nasolabial folds, glabella(skin between eyebrows)**
		- greasy scaley and pink ! 
		- bimodal skin dz = show up a birth "cradle cap", then only after 40 yrs old 
			- if younger than that check for HIV 
	3. Tinea versicolor  
		- very flat but raised papules still!
		- trunk/upper extremities
		- light/very brown, versitile, flat scale 
		- spaghetti + meatballs looks like a hybrid fungus - **both spores and hyphae** : **pitrysporum ovale**
	4. Secondary syphilis  
		- trunk/palms/soles
		- young mostly , non-pururitic 
		- 'ham spots' =papules that are scaley, contagious and loaded with spirochetes!
	5. Candida intertrigo  
		- body folds
		- very painful - trigger complement system
		- **bright red, satellite pinpoint papules/pustules**
	6. Tinea capitis/corporis/cruris/pedis  
		- fungal infection due to **dermatophytes** - gonna be thin pencil like breaking into a branch (microsporum, trichophyton, epidermophyton)
		- scalp = capitis
		- body = corporis
		- groin = cruris 
		- feet = pedis "dry feet"
	7. Pityriasis rosea   more history - driven 
		- trunk/upper extremities
		- initial = herald patch, like ringworm 
		- 7-14 days later burst of lesions all over the body "salmon-colored" ovale papules with a collarette of scales trailing
		- looks like a christmas tree - in fall, winter, spring ;; will go thru the world 
		- very pruritic, 12 wks resolved, slow resolving 
	8. Lichen planus
		- oral cavity has wickham's striae, on volar wrist, male genitalia + lower back, whiteish streak 
		- flat topped, violaceous, polygonal pruritic papules "Polygonal - big and small different sizes, flat"
		- koebner phenomenon - similar to psoriasis, wherever you have trauma or scratching, lesions develop 
2. eczematous dermatitis - different morhpological groups = **please do derm rotation!** , we see "oozy weepy a lot", in comparison to psoriasis
	- erythematous  / red
	- ill defined borders
	- acute phase is oozey weepy -> use cream
	- later become dry + scaley (chronic) = use ointment 
	- contact derm
		- irritant vs allergic
		1. irritant = no memory t cells, you get the rash, then if you get exposed to same thing, no more rash like diaper stufff
		2. allergic = memory t cells like poison ivy, you get it again and again 
	- noncontact derm
		1. atopic derm = on **face with sparing the center**. eventually ends up on extremities
			- this affects many children as early as 6 wks
			- hx of asthma, hay fever in pt or in family 
			- look for **dennie-morgan folds beneath eye, hyperlinear palms - extra lines in the palms, or inc IgE**
		- nonatopic derm
			1. lichen simplex chronicus - ankle/nape of neck, very localized + pruritic, you **rub and rub, inc the skin lines = lichenified!!! chronic + ongoing**
				- inciting incident usually bug bite 
			2. dyshidrotic eczema - pompholyx, recurrent **crops of vesicles, usually on digits**
				- hx of hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating, usually worsen in summer 
			3. stasis derm - from everybody 
				- on lower extremities, from leg swelling + occlusion of lymphatics = sclerosis of small BVs 
				- you get oozy eczema and later hyperpigmentation of yellow-brown 
				- purutic = **bilateral!!!**
				- etiology - idk but there's venous insufficiency, knee surgery, or drug induced , or CHF, pulm htn etc. 
			4.  nummular eczema 
				- basically anywhere - "super dry skin"
				- coin shaped plaques, oozy weepy and later dry and scaley 
				- give steroid + moisturizer 
3. vesiculobullous dz
	1. erythema multiforme
		- minor - in kids, pink/light pink of "target/iris lesions" = on palms/soles
		- major. =stevens-johnson syndrome = now in skin AND MOUTH, usually adults and some kids 
		- TEN - toxic epidermal necrolysis - like when you can take your total skin off, 50% mortality 
			- all internal organ mucosal linings sloughing off, like you die actually, 3rd degree burns in and out 
			- from drugs
	2. bullous pemphigoid - tense, if it's a blister that stays 
	3. pemphigus vulgaris - flaccid blisters - if it breaks down very easily 
4. acneiform eruptions - acne is the basic, with 
	1. prototype acne vulgaris  - everything else is not acne but look like acne 
		- face/chest/**upper** back/shoulder , so upper parts of body 
		- newborn - adulthood , all throughout  
		- hair follicule occlusion -> bacteria -> **comedone(whitehead/blackheads)/papule(adding in the bacteria)/pustule/nodule(rupture below the skin)/cyst**
		- treatable, not curable. this is multifactoral but this is genetics mostly , family hx, and oily environment. stress plays roles too 
	2. rosacea-  
		- **central face**!! red 
			- conjunctiva = ocular rosacea 
		- no comedones = no whitehead/backheads
		- **hereditary + blush easily etc. in ADULTs**
		- many triggers like sun, spicy foods, red wine, blood vessels open; treatable but not curable
		- **rhinophyma - end stage rosacea, lumpy bumpy + very oily if not treated**
	3. perioral dermatitis POD 
		- this is just rosacea but **in the lower face!!**
		- same triggers etc 
		- **hx of sensitive skin , make sure you use chem free sunscreens**
	4. steroid acne 
		- **upper trunk , not the face**
		- sudden eruption + hard to treat and up to a year to get better. 
		- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6793974/ - careful with this bc steroid psychosis 
5. morbiliform eruptions - measle-like, penicillin like 
	- neck, trunk, extermities - **bilateral/symmetrical**
	- 1-3 cm lesions surrounded by normal skin 
	- exanthem!!! 
	- viral cause, and drug induced mainly (antibiotics, allopurinol, anti-epileptic, nsaids, herbal/natural therapies) - onset in 1-2 wks, and then re-exposure 1-3 days bc these are memorized 
6. disorders of pigmentation 
	1. melasma - central face, and sun-exposed. 
		- 'mask of pregnancy - seen in pregnant women'
		- hyperpigmented patches 
		- genetic, hormone, sun exposure, meds - prevent tis with sunscreen basically ! 
	 2. vitilligo - face/trunk/extremities
		- bilateral
		- symmetrical
		- depigmented macules/patches
		- seen mainly in darker skin groups
		- **check for other autoimmune dz = hashimoto's, graves, pernicious anemia**
	3. postinflammatory pigment alteration PIPA or postinflammatory hyper/hypopigmentation PIH 
		- anywhere, totally from hx of inflammatory event, skin trauma, acne, etc 
		- hyper/hypopigmented macules/patches -> **uneven tone**

biopsy - to confirm dx and not make the dx

random information about sunscreen, not on test 
- chem sunscreens - active ingredient = will be benzones, etc etc = only working for hours 2-4 hrs twice a day in the afternoon too , not waterproof
- zinc bases = mineral sunscreens = waterproof 6-8 hrs, it stays 
	- 5-24% , if they're super white, good to have 10+%
	- only outdoor light 
- tinted white = are better- has iron oxide, which is blocking both in and outdoor light , put on thin layer 
- spray ons - must rub it in !!! 
- sunscreen sticks - good for kids 
- lip sunscreens cancer on lip - 5.5% zinc etc
