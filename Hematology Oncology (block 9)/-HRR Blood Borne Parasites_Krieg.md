explain - prevention/treatment
look at life cycle 
etc 
mostly in us - tympanosoma cruzi + babesia microti
basically note - we have climate change that can bring dz to us 
![[1. Blood Borne Parasites_Krieg_NOTES (1).pdf]]
vector borne dz - caused by parasites, bacteria or viruses 
biggest killer - malaria - 219 mil cases globally mostly kids before 5 
most are preventable - neglected tropical dz

in malaria - Synchronized lysis of red blood cells by a new generation of merozoites is what causes the classic symptomatic paroxysms of malaria. The liver infection stage does not cause symptoms to the human host.|

| Diethylcarbazine (DEC) is recommended for _Wuchereria bancrofti_ and _Brugia sp_. Albendazole or DEC are DOC for Loa Loa, Ivermectin for Onchocerca. |     |

parasites - euk, humans aren't the primary hosts. acquired by ingestion, bites or skin penetration 
- ==reproduction feeding form - trophozoite==
- ==protective/dormant form - cysts== 
protozoa - bloodborne infections 
==apicomplexa = sexual reproduction, life cycles, multiple hosts "BP to CT", babesia plasmodium- all has different forms ring forms and stuff to see early trophs== 
- barbesia
- ==plasmodium -  2 cycles==
	- ==asexual cycle - taking place in human==, basically gets ==transferred in the form of oocysts -> sporozoites (cyst form hard to dz) -> merozoites in the blood (ring form, can be diagnosed thru its development to diff forms) -> trophozoites -> gametozoites (goes back into mosquito when they bite into a person)==
	- ==sexual - in the mosquito, replication in here.== this is how it's spread!
	- ==vivax(latam + india), ovale(africa), malariae(africa + asia), falciparum(africa + asia)==. hard bc it typically takes 2-3 wks for rbcs to sync with the timer. 
		- ==vivax. + ovale - they have periodicity== - when the parasitized rbc are killed, anemia - direct parasite lysis -> ==RBC products phagocyzed by reticuloendothelial system "black water fever" bc they have lyzed rbcs in urine.== 
			- ==fever periodicity - paroxicisms - this is a tertian fever. fever, pause, fever.== 
	-  ==malariae + falciparum - quartan fever, fever, pause pause, and fever. **periodicity is rare in falciparum infections**==
		- p ==falciparum - infects rbcs of all ages==; this ==alters cell membrane causing it to adhere to endothelial cells, causing **capillary congestion-> cerebral malaria in kids, pulm edema + renal failure**==
		- ==malariae attacks only senescent cells== (cells that have permanently stopped dividing but don't die off as they should) 
	- ==see: seizures, coma, organ failure, anemia, splenomegaly, cerebral malaria ; paroxysm lasts hours - cold, hot, wet stages== 
	- ==disease takes 2-3 wks, but may be months if they take suppressant drugs...== 
	- no clinical signs of infections associated with liver phase - ==liver phase - it's in the liver, if you don't biopsy you don't find it, no clinical signs== 
	- ==DX: parasitology thick and thin blood smears - thick smear requires skilled observer and then thin one for species id== 
		- ==bloodwork - low hb, anemia== 
		- ==rapid tests - paraSight F - detects **HRP2 excreted by P falciparum**== 
		- ==optimal too - detects lactate dehydrogenase + distinguish between p falciparum + vivax.== 
know these ring forms. gametosite forms and ring forms as the exems
==![[plasmodium ring forms and gametocyte.png|628x433]]==
bananas - micro/macrogametocytes = in falciparum - these are going back into the mosquito afterwards. 

==PROTECTIVE - sickle cell trait of heterozygous HbS makes rbc less hospitable to falciparum -== 
==thalassemias similar protection to sickle cell==
==duffy antigens on rbcs - absent in many west africans, protective against vivax== 
- TREAT: depends on geographic region of infection .... queen = drugs that end in quine ; just pharm stuff might look at later.  [[-MMT Antimalarial Drugs+Therapies for Other Blood-Borne Parasites Blumer]]
	- ==color queen chloroquine - All plasmodia except falciparum; Common resistances except caribbean, west panama and middle east== 
	- ==me fly queen mefloquine - For chloroquine resistant plasmodia; strong drug, prophylactic, one a week== 
	- Ato-vampire-queen ==atovaquone== proguanil - All plasmodia ; ==prophylactic, better tolerated, **G6PD deficient NO "queen**"== 
	- primal queen ==primaquine - P. vivax, P. ovale (targets liver stage)== 
	- Art (queen) ==Artemisinin - P. falciparium== 
	- Dining queen quinine-  vivax and malariae ; headaches, teniti

APIcomplexa
==lyme dz, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rocky mt spotted fever(northeast), etc - all tick borne dz rising co infections happening - nantucket fever - babesiosis==
- ==babesia microti - deer tick, hemolytic anemia, fatigue, myalgia, fever== 
- ==NE america,== 
- ==DX parasitized rbc on blood smear/pcr== 
- ==TREAT: azithromycin + atovaquone== 
	- ==binary fission== - ==gametocytes replicate in mice, then will go into tick==, -> ==ray bodies== -> ==zygoute sexual production -> kinetes which invade salivary glands== 
	- ==multinucleated sporoblast and sporozoites can go into humans and invade rbcs, binary fission in us to make merozoites and so on== 
		- ==the human becomes the mouse== 
		- ==***maltese cross ring form***== 
![[babesiosis maltese cross.png]]
tenessee- bulls eye, rash 1 day ago, tick removed , denies symptoms just itchy red rash. 
erythematous plaque - central clearing, crusted papule - bulls eye appearance. 
==southern-tick associate rash illness - **this lone star tick in the southern us - no test due to uknown agent, in tenessee!**==
==TREAT: topical glucocorticoids 2 wks, rash will resolve completely== 
- ==in places where lyme + STARI southern tick associated rash illness coexist, **doxycycline can be used while ruling borrelia burgdorferi out**== 
- ==these lone star ticks aren't vectors of lyme but are getting expanded.== monitor for systemic symptoms

==flagellated = asexual repro, binary fission "TTriGLycerides"==
- trypanosoma ; leishmania 
==trypanosoma cruzi - kissing bug -> chagas disease==
- ==bug bites, food contaminated with reduviid feces==
- ==central/south am; leading cause of chronic heart dz, ppl don't know they got it beforehand.== , most ppl don't know - hard to keep it outta blood supply. ==only 1/3 of new infections are symptomatic but chronic infections are still scary== 
- ==DX - blood smear in early, hard in chronic== 
- clinical : ==romaña sign(swelling of one eye), fever, cardiomyopathy, megacolon== 
	- we see ==host tissue cell about to burst and release, a ton of purple dots buildup== 
	- ==![[Trypanosoma brucei and cruzi.png]]==
	- ruffling moves for locomotion
- ==TREAT: benznidazole== 
==trypanosoma brucei -> 'sleeping sickness'==
- ==tsetse fly bites, central africa==
- ==sleepiness from cns vasculitis, heart failure==
- parasites seen in blood smear early + then ab tests
- TREAT: suramin or melarsoprol 

==leishmania -> leishmaniasis -== 
- ==nocturnal, phlebotomine sandfly bites==
- ==tropical + subtropical regions including south america==
- ==painless cutaneous ulcer/visceral (kala azar) form wks after bite; many rough dots on face==
	- we see - ==obligate intracellular parasites of macrophages== + tissues
	- diffuse cutaneous - ==disseminated infection of subq nodules up to 20 yrs in immunocompromised ppl==
	- ==mucocutaneous - destructive ulcer of skin + mucous memb==
	- ==kala azar - **black illness** - hyperpigmented skin lesions - irregular bouts of fever, significant weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, high mortality if not treated== 
	- slinder body + polar flagellum when extracellular 
	- ==loose flagellum dark dots in host cell = **leishman-donovan bodies =  intracellular amastigotes in macrophages**==
	- ![[leishman-donovan bodies.png]]
- DX - parasite in biospy or pcr 
- ==TREAT: cutaneous: pentavalent antimonials,== 
	- ==visceral: liposomal amphotericin B== 
	- 28 day course of oral miltefosine antiprotozoal agent. 
	- prognosis - resolves most of the time, but ==chronic ulceration does disfiguring scars==

parasites - helminths - cause peripheral eosinophilia 
Cestodes "TED" - tapeworms 

trematodes "frames per second"- flukes

nematolds "NOW ATTT SALE" - roundworms thru gi tract 
==**loa loa** - daylight; eye worm - **bites of deer flies** in W. africa== -  
- ==calabar swellings, itchy edemas around the body. w fever, itching, pain worm moving in eye== 
	- adult worm migrates thru host, ==benign form of it moving in eye== 
- ==we see 2 cm filariae in blood collected in ***daylight*** or from conjunctiva==
- ==TREAT: albendazole or diethylcarbazine== 

==wuchereria bancrofti -->nighttime; elephantiasis - lypmhatic filariasis - neglected tropical dz in africa, latam, pacific islands, asia.== 
- culex mosquitos anopheles
- ==fever lymphatic blockage, lymphedema, elephantiasis affects humans only== 
- reasoning for edema: ==Adult filariae blocking afferent lymphatic ducts|==
- ==3-4 cm filariae in blood collected at ***NIGHT***==
- ==TREAT: diethylcarbazine/DEC or doxycycline== 

==brugia malayi - lymphatic filariasis== 
==mansonia mosquitos- coastal + SE asia==
- ==fever, lymphatic blockage, lymphedema and ELEPHANTITIS which also INFECTS ANIMALS!==
- ==2 cm filariae in blood collected at ***NIGHT***==
- ==- TREAT: diethylcarbazine/DEC or doxycycline== 
- ==pathogen - microfilariae/juvenile worms delivered by mosquito, which then migrate to lymph nodes, mature and then block these vessels to birth more, migrating to the blood==
- early infection - fever + eosinophilia etc-some spontaneously cleared
- ==issue - **dead worms  = inflammation and coarseness in vessels + skin**==
- microscopic image: ==note all the fibrous tissue and eyes seen in the lymphatic vessels== ![[brugia malayi eggs micro.png|220x214]]
-

==onchocera volvulus - river blindness, black flies in equator climates worldwide==
- ==subq nodules, pruritic skin, blindness; skitchy scratching seen - little patches== 
- ==filariae seen in skin snip- basically huge worm like things== 
- ==TREAT: ivermectin +/- doxy==
