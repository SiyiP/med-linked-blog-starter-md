==![[complement pathway.png]]==

complement system - everyone has one - evolutionary and ancient. ==without an active one, you'd die==. but if you have an ==hyperactive ones get passed on== 
- you can survive with hyperactive ones! that's why it gets passed down 
==complement - many soluble proteins + membrane receptors, major ones C1-9== 
- they are all cleaved into A + B
	- ==a = aren't directly involved, they go Away and do neutrophil chemotaxis/anaphylaxis stuff==
	- ==B = larger Bind to the surface of bacteria== 
- so cleavage fragments will complex together to make enzymes down a cascade ; they need to be activated with the cascade

the whole thing with the complement is ==3 pathways that go and make the C3b convertase, which frees the C3b!==
- alt + classical + lectin arrive to C3 convertase, which will have the C3b be freed
- ==C3b will complex on **surface of the pathogen**==
	- ==C3b can be recognized by **phagocytes** + engulfed==
	- also ==C3b can recruit MAC C5-9 to make a pore and lyse the microbe== 
	- and ==recruitment and activation of leukocytes== 

==classical pathway = immunoglobulin mediation== 
- mediated by immunoglobulin - ==Ig binds to antigens on the bacterial surface==
- ==C1q complex will become activated, making C2 and C4 into their C2b + C4b==
	- this is the C3 convertase!!!!!!(==C3b2b==)
- ==inhibits large insoluble immune complexes + CLEARS THEM OUT== 
- ==any deficiency in this is = **SLE lupus**== 
==lectin pathway -== 
- ==bind to exposed mannose + fucose residues on the bacterial or pathogen surface==
- catalyze ==C2 + C4 -> C3 convertase (C3b2b)==
==alternative pathway== 
- ==c3b starts as the first step (spill over from the other pathways possibly during an infection or something)==
- ==c3b attaches to bacterial surface , and then thru Factor B + D, it catalyzes into a slightly different C3 convertase (C3b with a b3)==
- ==solubilizes large insoluble immune complexes==
- ==deficiency in this causes **pyogenic infections**==

==terminal pathway; common MAC==
After the pathways, once the ==C3b will then attach back onto the C3 convertase -> **C5 convertase**== 
- just ==2 C3bs with a Bb== 
- this will ==make C5 -> C5A and C5b(ready to make MAC)==
- recruit of ==C6,7,8, and then **C9 as a whole bunch of columns that makes a pore!!!!** and things will leak out.==
- ==deficiency in this causes **neisserial infections**==
- ==you can inhibit C5 with eculizumab==

==Complement deficiencies==
---
==immune complexes need to be cleared out in the phagocytes of the liver + spleen etc, usually by classical pathway== 
normally, **formation of LARGE insoluble immune complexes are INHIBITED by the classical pathway**
- and even if they're made, they are solubilized by alt path. 
- ==parts of the classical pathway can be deficient, leading to these large immune complexes (C1q, C2/4 deficiency)==
	- then we can't clear these out
	- ==deposit of these complexes, leading to **immune complex disease SLE lupus**==

==alt pathway deficiency - **if we don't have stabilizing factor of properdin(stabilizes C3bbb complex) + Factor D**==
- **more susceptible to pyogenic infections**

if we have ==deficiency in all pathways - C3 affected==
- ==pyogenic infections AND **dense deposit disease== that**
- ==C3 + C5 nephritic factors = autoantibodies that stabilize their respective C3/5 convertase.== if you have these forming, it means that the ==C3/5 will **stay active forever, which means hyperactive complement system**==
	- ==C3-mediated globmeruloneprhtis== 

==deficiency in terminal pathways = **C5-9 MAC components**==
- ==inc susceptiblity to **neisserial** (gonococcal + meningococcal infections); intracellular mechanisms==

---
==dx by - **measure C3 + C4, measured directly in nearly every biopsy**==
- ==to measure **whole (C1-9)** function = CH50 test = total hemolytic complement, ability of serum to lyse sheep RBCs sensitized with rabbit IgM that activates complement== 
==how to not attack SELF with the complement?== 
- ==complement enzymes are zymogens== + req activation 
- ==labile intermediates, especially reactive thioester **active components don't last long**=== so if binding of bacterial surface doesn't happen quickly it's hydrolyzed , a way of controlling where it activates too
- ==regulatory steps controlled by plasma proteins==
- ==attack of bystander host cells are prevented by **inhibitory membrane proteins on them**==

==complement inhibitor deficiencies==
---
In Plasma 
- ==C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) • **HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA**==
	- much ==rapid onset swelling in skin + mucosal tissues of upper resp tract - **no hives + itching**==
	- ==swelling of **larynx can kill you - asphyxiation**==
	- ==dental surgery = a common inducer, associated with trauma/allergen== 
		- ==**overproduction of bradykinin, a vasodilator**; bc this cascade is also inhibited by C1 INH bc it's a promiscuous one==
	- family hx, check C4 , measurement of C1 ... 
	- ==TREAT: **essentially you replace C1 INH, give them fresh frozen plasma or C1 INH concentrate**==
- ==Factor I • - commonly have a mutation against this in **atypical familial HUS!!!** (Factor H, I, CD46)==
- ==Factor H • - commonly have an autoantibody against this in== 
	- ==**atypical acquired HUS!!!** (Factor H, I, CD46)==
	- ==mutation in **age related macular degeneration, damage to eye!**== 

==Membrane-attack complex deficiencies •**main thing is PIGA on the RBC which attaches these things!**==
- ==Decay Acceleration Factor (DAF, CD55) • -> **paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria** stops GPI synthesis of DAF + CD59==
- ==CD59 - MAC inhibitor - - **paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria** stops GPI synthesis of DAF + CD59==
- ==Membrane Cofactor Protein (CD46) - mac inhibitor - commonly have a mutation against this in **atypical familial HUS!!!(Factor H, I, CD46)**==
if there's any dysfunction of these, we see hyperactivity of the complement system 

---
==thrombic microangiopathies==
- overlapping entities categorized by primary vs secondary 
- ==mediated by platelet activation + endothelial cell injury== 
- tissue shows thrombotic microangiopathy 
	- ==**ALL TMA LOOK THE SAME! in the tissues**==
	- ==arteriole will get **swollen + occluded with schistocytes that are stuffed inside the vessel**==
	- in renal segment, ==glomeruli has PINK bright things stuffed in== 
	- or ==arterioles with gray mucoid things, and if it's chronic enough we see vascular remodding "onion skin"==
clinical findings = **very varied causes**. typically some e.coli to the uremia, but if you don't have that, it's categorized as "atypical" AKA we don't know what's causing this 
- ==hemolytic - microangiopathic hemolytic anemia==
- ==thrombocytopenia==
- ==**uremia** - acute renal failure== 

==**"atypical HUS" = is more complement mediated!!!!!**==
==and TTP can be acquired with genetic ADAMTS13, or acquired with ADAMTS13 deficiency== 
==can be drug-mediated TMAS== 
[[-SFP Bleeding Disorders I-IV Overview, 1 and 2dary hemostasis_Squires]]
- ==atypical HUS: can be acquired or hereditary, reducing complement activation by the alt pathway== 
- ==familial aHUS = **disruption of *alt* pathway of complement system**==
	- ==associated with mutations of factor H, I and CD46!!! there's a genetic panel== 
- ==acquired aHUS== 
	- ==most commonly, an autoantibody against complement factor H== 
==TREAT: eculizumab - monoclonal antibody acting against C5, preventing MAC== 
- ==you need meningococcal vaccine before treating; bc you're turning off your MAC!!== though bc it's similar to having a terminal deficiency  

==secondary TMAs==
- ==scleroderma, SLE, malignant htn, pregnancy , transplant rejection==
- **note about every single TMA = they all include instances where ENDOTHELIAL cells are injured, which recruit and form fibrin thrombi**

==CBC for TMAs== 
- ==anemia, thrombocytopenia,==
- peripheral smear schistocytes
- ==sr chem and creatine shows acute renal failure, high creatinine== 
- ==**LDH inc bc of hemolysis**== 
- ==haptoglobin dec bc it binds freed hemoglobin== 
- ==coag testing - normal, to distinguish against DIC==
- ==direct antiglobuin test = negative== 
---
==**paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobuinuria**==
- ==complement induced hemolytic anemia== 
- ==**acquired** - membrane defect, these cells are clonal, somatic mutation that affects myeloid stem cells==
- ==nocturnal bc our plasma get **acidic at night, activating complement**== these guys ==wake up with bloody urine== 
- ==anemia, thrombosis -> **PROTHROMBOTIC bc the complement is activated**, so you get portal and hepatic large vein blockage and death== 
	- *==*acquire MDS myelodysplastic syndrome or AML acute myelogenous leukemia bc this is clonal!!! you get mutate more!!**==
	- [[-SFP White Blood Cells I-IV_Rinker]]
==mutation in PIGA = will remove that GPI anchor in the myeloid stem cells (RBC's no longer have GPI anchor which are meant to attach CD55 + CD59)==
- ==CD55 = DAF==
- ==CD59 = inhibitor of MAC== 

==pathological RBCs (not all of them, just this one subset coming from the clone that's mutated) don't have that PGI anchor that will stop the complement MAC from attacking them, the self instead, so they'll get lysed.== 
- ==TREAT: **eculizumab treats it too** - monoclonal antibody acting against C5, preventing MAC ... otherwise, give anticoag== 
==DX: flow cytometry - see which cells **express both CD55 AND 59**==
- normal would express both 
- but ==the pathological ones would have only one or none. (more to the left )==

---
==age related macular degeneration==
- ==dry = central geographic atropy== 
- ==wet = neovascular or exudate== 
==caused by aging, smoking, mutation ATP synthase gene, or **mutations in FACTOR H**==
- ==inc ROS + inflammation== 
- ==TREAT: nutritional supplements - vita E, o3 fatty acids, lutein, zeaxantin.... supportive therapy only /:==
