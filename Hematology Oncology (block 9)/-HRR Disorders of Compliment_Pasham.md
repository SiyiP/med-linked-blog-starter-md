complement system - everyone has one - evolutionary and ancient. without an active one, you'd die. but if you have an yhyperactive one, it'll get passed on 
- you can survive with hyperactive ones! that's why it gets passed down 
complement - many soluble proteins + membrane receptors, major ones C1-9 
- they are all cleaved into A + B
	- a = aren't directly involved, they go Away and do neutrophil chemotaxis/anaphylaxis stuff
	- B = larger Bind to the surface of bacteria 
- so cleavage fragments will complex together to make enzymes down a cascade ; they need to be activated with the cascade

the whole thing with the complement is 3 pathways that go and make the C3b convertase!
- alt + classical + lectin arrive to C3 convertase, which will have the C3b be freed
- C3b will complex on **surface of the pathogen**
	- C3b can be recognized by **phagocytes** + engulfed
	- also C3b can recruit MAC C5-9 to make a pore and lyse the microbe 
	- and recruitment and activation of leukocytes 

classical pathway = immunoglobulin mediation 
- mediated by immunoglobulin - binds to antigens on the bacterial surface
- C1q complex will become activated, catelyzing C2 and C4 into their C2b + C4b
	- this is the C3 convertase!!!!!!(C3b2b)
- inhibits large insoluble immune complexes 
lectin pathway - 
- bind to exposed mannose + fucose residues on the bacterial or pathogen surface
- catalyze C2 + C4 -> C3 convertase (C3b2b)
alternative pathway 
- c3b starts as the first step (spill over from the other pathways possibly during an infection or something)
- c3b attaches to bacterial surface , and then thru Factor B + D, it catalyzes into a slightly different C3 convertase (C3b with a b3)
- solubilizes large insoluble immune complexes

After the pathways, once the C3b will then attach back onto the C3 convertase -> **C5 convertase** 
- just 2 C3bs with a Bb 
- this will make C5 -> C5A and C5b(ready to make MAC)
- recruit of C6,7,8, and then **C9 as a whole bunch of columns that makes a pore!!!!** and things will leak out. 

deficiencies
---
immune complexes need to be cleared out in the phagocytes of the liver + spleen etc, 
normally, **formation of LARGE insoluble immune complexes are INHIBITED by the classical pathway**
- and even if they're made, they are solubilized by alt path. 
- parts of the classical pathway can be deficient, leading to these large immune complexes (C1q, C2/4 deficiency)
	- then we can't clear these out
	- deposit of these complexes, leading to **immune complex disease SLE lupus**

alt pathway deficiency - **if we don't have stabilizing factor of properdin(stabilizes C3bbb complex) + Factor D**
- **more susceptible to pyogenic infections**

if we have deficiency in all pathways - C3 affected
- pyogenic infections AND **dense deposit disease that **
- C3 + C5 nephritic factors = autoantibodies that stabilize their respective C3/5 convertase. if you have these forming, it means that the C3/5 will **stay active forever, which means hyperactive complement system**
	- C3-mediated globmeruloneprhtis 

deficiency in terminal pathways = **C5-9 MAC components**
- inc susceptiblity to neisserial (gonococcal + meningococcal infections)
- **intracellular organisms** 

---
dx by - **measure C3 + C4, measured directly in nearly every biopsy**
- to measure **whole (C1-9)** function = CH50 test = total hemolytic complement, ability of serum to lyse sheep RBCs sensitized with rabbit IgM that activates complement 

how to not attack SELF with the complement? 
- complement enzymes are zymogens + req activation 
- labile intermediates, especially reactive thioester **active components don't last long**= so if binding of bacterial surface doesn't happen quickly it's hydrolyzed , a way of controlling where it activates too
- regulatory steps controlled by plasma proteins
- attack of bystander host cells are prevented by **inhibitory membrane proteins on them**

complement regulation proteins
---
In Plasma 
- C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) • **HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA**
	- much rapid onset swelling in skin + mucosal tissues of upper resp tract - **no hives + itching**
	- swelling of **larynx can kill you - asphyxiation**
	- dental surgery = a common inducer, associated with trauma/allergen 
	- **overproduction of bradykinin, a vasodilator**; the contact cascade is also inhibited by C1 INH bc it's a promiscuous one
	- family hx, dec C4 , measurement of C1 ... 
	- TREAT: **essentially you replace C1, give them fresh frozen plasma or C1 concentrate**
- Factor I • 
- Factor H • 
- Others • 
Membrane-bound •
- Decay Acceleration Factor (DAF, CD55) • 
- CD59 • Membrane Cofactor Protein (CD46)
if there's any dysfunction of these, we see hyperactivity of the complement system 

thrombic microangiopathies
- overlappign entities categorized by primary vs secondary 
- mediated by platelet activation + endothelial cell injury 
- tissue shows thrombotic microangiopathy 
clinical findings= **very varied system**. typically some e.coli to the uremia, but if you don't have that, it's categorized as "atypical" AKA we don't know what's causing this 
- hemolytic - microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
- thrombocytopenia
- **uremia** - acute renal failure 
**"atypical HUS" = is more complement mediated!!!!!**
and TTP can be acquired with genetic ADAMTS13, or acquired with ADAMTS13 deficiency 
can be drug-mediated TMAS 
[[-SFP Bleeding Disorders I-IV Overview, 1 and 2dary hemostasis_Squires]]

secondary TMAs
- scleroderma,
