don't overthink these things - big picture not the small details. 
Objectives 
• Define transplantation and the different types 
• Know the immunologic mechanisms, histologic appearances, and clinical manifestations of: 
- – Hyperacute rejection 
- – Acute cellular (tubulointerstitial and vascular) rejection 
- – Acute antibody mediated rejection
- – Chronic rejection in the kidney 
• Know the immunologic mechanism and clinical manifestations of graft versus host disease.

main focus here on the kidneys 
types of transplant 
- autologous - graft in same person from one part to the other
- syngeneic - identical twins isograft
- allogeneic - allograft, diff member of same species 
- xenogeneic - xenograft - one species to another 

biggest transplant barrier - rejection + t cells + antibodies that can react and destroy the graft
[[-SFP Introduction to Organ Transplantation_Scalea]]

this is an adaptive immune phenomenon !!!
- prior exposure to donor MHC -> accelerated graft rejection = showing memory + specificity 
- ability to rapidly reject is mediated by lymphocytes and can be transferred by lymphocytes to a naive individual 
- depletion/inactivation of t lymphocytes = reduced graft rejection 
**memory specificity + lymphocyte mediation points at adaptive immune phenomenon**
rejection - t cells + antibodies made against antigens react and destroy - huge thing is HLA proteins as the main thing 

types of immunity / involved in rejection 
- type 2 = antibody mediated, antibodies against tissue/cells 
- t-cell mediated type 4 

alloantigens - HLA MHC molecules are what we try to match for. 
- **HLA genes are highly polymorphic, always some differences unless they're Identical twins** 
- histocompatibility antigens - determine outcome of the graft 
	- MHC HLA in humans + minor histocompatibility antigens = minor H antigens. 
	- vigorous rejection based on MHC mismatch

HLA matching - 
- bone marrow transplantation - requires match, and incomplete match generates **graft vs leukemia, which is therapeutic effect of incomplete match**
	- leukemic cells **get damaged in this process!! we lowkey WANT a match diversion, just a little bit**
- in solid organ transplantation = kidney + HLA matching , but no match in heart, lung, liver .... need HLA match exactly in kidney. 
- heart and lungs = matched on size, blood group + gender. such rare organs. 

HLA matching - more MHC alleles matched , the better the graft survival seen in the kidney 
- better match = longer lasting 
---
broad picture -
- direct recognition of something diferent between the CD8+ cells
- indirect recognition = APCs will present the foreign antigens to the CD4+ T cells, which allows them to get b cells to make antibodies + cause inflammation mediated injury 

types of rejection 
- hyperacute, type 2 hypersensitivity = **preformed antibodies already in the recipient = seen in ABO blood groups!! major one.**
	- also major HLA incompatibility from prior blood transfusions/pregnancies or previous transplants but that's more rare now 
		- reason why that's more rare: donor specific antibodies screend for by cross match, **donor lymphocytes with recipient's serum**
	- happens in minutes AS we transplant it, thrombosis in vessels after vessel inflammation, ischemic necrosis + loss of graft 
	- basically preformed antibody -> complement activation -> neutrophil margination -> inflammation -> thrombus ; ghosted and pale glomerulus 
- acute rejection - more common; type II and IV  
	- cellular rejection mediated by t cells 
		- within 8-10 days pst transplantation , even happening in well-matched kidneys 
		- CD8+ kills graft cells directly and CD4+ make cytokines + induce inflammation 
		- in kidney: tubulointerstitial or vascular inflammation - depending on where the damage is 
			- tubulointerstitial = busy and full of inflammation + dark cells with halos , filled with t cells!!! 
			- vascular inflammation = lymphocytes are inside the vessels, completely occluded. automatically highest degree of rejection to have. 
		- TREAT: with corticosteroids + antithymocyte globulin at higher rate aggro infection 
	- antibody mediated rejection mediated by antibodies + complement activation 
		- circulating anti-graft antibodies - donor specific antibodies called DSA 
		- presence of intra-graft deposition of complement *C4d* = **a complement split product after activation!!! in response to vascular damage, it will be along the capillaries**
		- **microvascular** inflammation = capillaritis!!! glomeruli involved severely 
		- unresponsive to conventional immunosuppression. 
		- TREAT: what we dread bc we have a slew of things that are less successful - plasmapheresis, rituximab, ivig, proteosome inhbiitor bortezomib, steroids, antithymocyte globulin 
![[complement pathway.png]]
the C4d split product from the C4 is without known biological function = it's a highly stable covalent bond and **remains bound like a footprint to the vessel walls while the antibodies that were on the walls disappear over time**
- c4 = part of the C3 convertase. C4d became a stain due to the adhesion - outlines all the small capillaries which indicates complement attacks of the vessels = a marker. 
	- both ab and cellular mediated rejection = presenting same way clinically with fever or tenderness over graft + inc creatinine 

chronic rejection - months to yrs post-transplant; type II and IV  
- major barrier to long term survival!!! can't keep them forever, theres and individualized survival curve ): 
- obliterative lesions in all solid organ transplants = vascular lesions in all transplant grps, organ specific obliterative lesions like the obliterative bronchiolitis in lung or vanishing bile duct in liver 
- why does it happen? idk? probably repeated injuries of t cell stuff attacking and humoral attacks, but even with ppl taking their meds / immunotherapy, they always get crhonic changes = this is random and unknown why 
	- immunological mechanism = t cell mediated, antibody mediated 
	- non-immunological = lipids , pre-existing dz like recurring things, CMV, ischemia reperusion injury 
- chronic inflammatory rxn - **walls of vessels get more and more thick, will close up the lumena, causing ischemia/occlusion** -> arteriosclerosis !!! endothelial injury + parenchyma **fibrosis**
	- you see some new glomerular membrane, like reduplication of the **basement membrane + fibrosis of tubular interstitium**

xenotransplantation - first pig to heart transplant - alleviate donor organ storage help
- hearts and lungs are rare, kidneys less so 

hematopoietic stem cell transplant - more commonly to treat hematopoietic malignancies, aplastic anemia or immunodeficiency 
- HLA matching - match as much as we can, at least 6/8 HLA , a little mismatch is good for graft v. leukemia effect 
- radiation blasting recipient to destroy their immune system - basically injecting them full of cells
- injected stem cells repopulate their marrow. + differentiate 
	- MOA: curing the hematopoietic neoplasms is with graft v donor; mature t cells present in bone marrow and recognize allo antigens on residual tumors to kill them 
autologous - your own stem cells
allogeneic - someone elses' - keep in mind graft vs host disease
- graft v host
- **immunologically competent cells from DONOR will be attacking graft.** understand donor vs recipient 
	- acute or chronic 
	- donor attacks recipient. can also have rejection if we have any residual host immunity killing the graft 
	- host is immunocompromised + unable to reject the allogeneic cells in graft - and donors attack recipient! 
	- **jaundice, rash, diarrhea; liver, skin, GI tract**
	- principal cause of mortality 
	- type IV hypersensitivity
