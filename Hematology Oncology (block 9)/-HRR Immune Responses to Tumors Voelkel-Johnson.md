emerging hallmarks - deregulation of cellular energetic, avoid immune distrution, tumor promoting inflammation 

initiation - some genomic chain in the cell
- changes are necessary but not sufficient 
promotion - 
- survival + clonal expansion of initiated cell + requires both cancer + non-cancerous cells
progression 
- growth of tumor in size + metastasis 

tumor - think of the microenvironment and an organ 
- cancer stem cells - few of these, very crucial for tumor regrowth even if all cancer cells are murked
- cancer associated fibroblasts - crosstalk between fibroblasts + cancer cells 
- immune inflammatory cells - promote the tumor 
- endothelial cells 

immune system - a hard job bc it's responding to self that is perceived as foreign 
- antigens that can be recognized as foreign can be expressed in any cell type 
- mechanisms that induce anti tumor immune responses need to span diverse cell types 

cancer without dz?
- more than 1/3 women have in situ tumors in breast, but actual cancers are 1%... **meaning immune system holds it at bay**. 
- we have more tumors!!! but our cancer rate is lower! either tumors are dormant or they regress . how?
	- **cancer immunosurveillance - huge host protection**
	- immune responses against tumors inhibit tumor growth... also if you have mouse fight tumor and then get same tumor inside it, it fights it faster - shows **adaptive immunity against it** 
	- also you can transfer immune arm into another to prevent tumors. **transfer the lymphocytes**
	- immunodeficient ppl have a higher rate of some tumors 
	- **immune checkpoint inhibitors PD-1 and CTLA-4 = blocking these lead to tumor remission**

tumor-specific antigens = proteins only expressed by tumors
- some might be found to be expressed on normal cells... 
tumor ASSOCIATED antigens - overexpressed **normal proteins,** just more are on tumor cells 

**what is recognized by t cells:**
- mutated self protein -> will be recognized by t cells as foreign
- product of mutated oncogene or mutated tumor suppressor gene = **tumor specific antigens**
	- Ras/Bcr/Abl fusion = all proto-oncogenes
	- tumor suppressors = p53
- overexpressed protein - - quantity - tyrosinase (melanin prod, normally expressed at low levels but inc in cancer )
- oncogenic virus 

other mutated proteins that can be unrelated to tumor formation = tumor ASSOCIATED antigens
- CTAG cancer testis antigen = tissue differentiation, and MAGE - melanoma associated antigen 
- quantity - tyrosinase (melanin prod, **normally** expressed at low levels but inc in cancer)
	- tyrosinase = think malignant melanoma 
- oncofetal: AFP/CEA = produced during development, but not made when immune system develops "shouldn't be seen in an adult"
	- AFP = germ cell tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma 
	- CEA = bowel cancers , occasionally lung/breast
- oncoviral proteins = HPV/EBV,  activation latent viral DNA  

immune mechanisms of tumor rejection = we need 3 signals 
1. t cell receptor will recognize the peptide in the MHC 
2. costimulation via CD28, OX40, 4-1BB etc (these depend on the tissue)
3. cytokines, by the CD4+ helper T cells, which help the **CD8+ t cell clonally expand, which will now see and recognize the tumor and kill them all**

elimination of tumor cells by t cells
- cd8+ can do cytotoxic granules dumping 
- death ligand expression = where FasL and TRAIL can **activate extrinsic apoptosis program , binding to death receptors on target cell**

cancer immunoediting
1. phase 1 elimination - everything works, all the crosspresentation etc... everything above works, so the tumor growth < cell death... so we don't even know there was a tumor 
2. equilibrium phase 2 = tumor cell VARIANTS survive, evade
	- tumor cells can antagonize the Th1 response
	- genetic instability lets them mutate
	- dormant tumors , growth = death 
how does evasion work?
- tumor cell can just simple not display that peptide anymore
- or not display class 1 MHC 
- **most common - tumor makes an inhibitory ligand, giving t cell the signal to shut down, mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines**
	t cell sees MHC1 , and then there's IFN-gamma **from the t cell, which induces expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells**
	- once the ligand is made, binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 on the T cell tells inhibition to reduce T cell proliferation or cause apoptosis 
	- also , **naive CD4+ are very plastic**
		- basically you WANT the Th1 response to be IL-12 and IFN-gamma. to help the CD8+ T cells, rejection of tumor 
		- but you can also get **IL-23**, which might make the naive CD4+ proinflammatory, which promotes a tumor 
		- TGF-b = gives you t-reg cells which will make tumor progress by suppressing the CD8+ 
		- IL-4 can drive antibody response instead, **and antibodies aren't that effective against tumors, not helpful**
- would-be tumor environment turns into a type 2 microenvirnoment
	- basically stuff like the Tregs and everything else shuts down the immune function 
	- tumor milieu - immune system doesn't function anymore

3. escape phase 3 - 
	- altered tumor microenvironment
	- stroma, cytokiens, 
	- tumor cell variants grow + growth > death

immunotherapy 
- standard approaches are chemo/rad, but immunotherapy is higher specificity 
	- we can take the antigen specific tumor t cells from patient, expand in vitro 
	- or give monoclonal antibodies specific for the tumor antigen to fight it 

cytokine therapy - giving signal 3 
- interferon + interleukin 
- 3 groups interferons:
	- type 1(IFN-a, IFN-b), type 2(IFN-g) , type 3 (IFN-delta)
	- IFN-a only one approved for leukemias/lymphomas, renal cell cancer + melanoma 
- interleukins 
	- il2 = toxic, sustains the t cells response, expanding t cells without loss of functionality + regressions might occur
	- IL15 = sustains T cell + NK cell prolif, less toxic than IL2, but recombinant protein too shortlived. so they made something that might be able to elongate the time

Dendritic cell therapy 
- take dendritic cells from patient, pulsed them with tumor lysate/short peptides which respond to antigen of tumor 
- then make a vaccine and give it to the person , 
- basically then dendritic cells would antigen present to the tumor-specific t cells 
1. MUC1 = helps patients show immunity against tumors + against epithelial mucin MUC1
	- immunogenic + safe but not effective ): bc of pre-existing strong immunosuppressive cancer environment of the tumor ; **must give to patients of low tumor burden but high recurrence chance**
	- now we have the shift to a preventative approach. - good to combat recurrence of colon cancer 

antibody therapy - non-checkpoint inhibitors 
- ends in -mab
1. alemtuzumab = target CD52 , present on mature lymphocytes!! **induciton of complement system**
2. rituximab = cd20 present on b cells, b cell lymphomas(this was inactivating the t cells, so blocking this helps) 

immune checkpoints 
ex) ifn-gamma mediated expression of PD-L1
- th1 response = secretion of IFN-g by lymphocytes
- IFN-g -> **PD-L1 expression in tumor cells**
- which will then inhibit the t cell!!!
so we should block this interaction!

CTLA-4, the checkpoint inhibitor. - B7-1 and B7-2 binding to CTLA-4 inhibits t cell killing 
- signal 2 is shut down, so you must generate the antibody that restores this all. 
- blocking this B7-1 and B7-2 or CTLA allows the t cell killing the tumor 
- **CTLA-4 inhibitor are there** 
- **PD1 and PD-L1 ligand inhibitors are there too**
	- SEs: diarrhea, inflammation of lungs, rashes + itchiness, problems with hormones etc 

checkpoint inhibitor failures ): just not enough
- whole focus would be the combination - which pts need what? individualized therapy options 
- combination meds = some trials to this

immune cell therapy 
- tumor infiltrating lympohcytes TIL 
	- harvesting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes for **expansion in vitro, then putting them back in**
	- ofc not all patients have TIL 
- T cell receptor gene modified cells 
	- harvest peripheral t cells from blood
	- transduce with viral vector carrying the TCR specific for the tumor antigen 
	- expand in vitro, readminister into patient
	- drawback - **we need the specific TCR and also it's restricted to Class 1 MHC** not all pts were eligible 

adoptive t cell transfer protocol - 
- prepare pts with conditioning of total body radiation etc 
- but it can work with melanomas and stufff omg but doesn't work in everybody and we don't know why 

also engineered cell therapy 
- if we know the tumor antigen, we can make a chimeric antigen receptor instead
- CARs inside the t cell will act the same as a TCR, but on the outside, it looks like an antibody 
	- so it's not necessarily MHC 1 restricted, everyone is eligible 
risks of giving living drugs - **basically you can't control the dose or impact of the dose that well if the cells are alive**
- t cells expanded very fast in a girl -> **cytokine release syndrome**, released everything, caused a lot of illness. 

safety concerns - we need to work out the symptoms. some patients died ): the ratio of cells you give is important. like 1:1 ratio of CD4:CD8 is big 
safety switch - to shut the cells off if it's out of control like with cytokine release syndrome 

hard to make it work in solid organ tumors bc t cells struggle to get on in there 

why are there so many Car T cell products
- many domains can influence how the cell behaves 
- depends on what the costimulatory molecule is too 
	- CD28 as costim = higher amount of very effective cells, but a short lived 
	- 4-1BB = slower but sustained persistence 

main thing about off the shelf cell therapies - for bridging, it takes like 8 wks to grow the special cells, they might not have 8 wks to live ): 
- failure can still happen
