test taking notes
 Deletion and receptor editing in response to self-antigen recognition only occurs in the primary lymphoid tissue (bone marrow for B-cells) and result in central tolerance. 
 
 If a self-reactive B-cell is not deleted by those central tolerance mechanisms and is released into the periphery (circulatory system, or secondary lymphoid tissues), if it encounters any antigen that crosslinks its antigen receptors in the presence o**f PAMPs or DAMPs (second signal)** it will be **activated**. This is how autoimmune disease is initiated.

CTLA-4 is a checkpoint inhibition molecule expressed by T-cells only (CTL is in the name - so easy to remember). It's expression is **induced on T-cells after activation** by **antigen (effector T-cells)**, so it acts in the ***periphery***. It is also expressed constitutively on Tregs, which are an effector of peripheral tolerance.|

- All T-cells are CD3+ so that is not a helpful marker.  
- TH1, TH2 and Tregs are CD4 +, 
- IFN-gamma expression is a marker of TH1 cells. 
- FoxP3 is a transcription factor unique to Tregs, so they are in Lane C **Another marker of Tregs is high expression of CD25, the alpha-chain of IL-2 R, but that will also be expressed to a lesser degree on all antigen activated T-cells, and so it is not a unique marker.**


immature B-cells are capable of activating unused alleles of Ig light chains when a heavy chain - light chain combination results in a BCR with strong affinity for self antigens. = this is reeptor editing 

AIRE - autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome. 
Complement - lupus and other immune complex disorders. 

FoxP3 - X-linked polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy (IPEX). 
NOD2 - Crohns disease, Blau syndrome. It encodes a protein expressed in monocytes, macrophage, dendritic cells and some intestinal epithelial cells that activates NF-kappaB in response to bacterial PAMPS.  Over 30 different mutations have been associated with increased risk for Crohn's.

why do some moms get Rh antibody when they're Rh- with Rh+ baby? =  breakdown of immune privilege - The fetus is normally protected by passive and active immune privilege such that the mother's immune system is not exposed to fetal antigens via the placenta during pregnancy. However, the physical trauma of parturition almost always results in some fetal blood entering skin tears or incisions, sensitizing the mother's immune system to fetal blood antigens, most commonly Rh.

PD-1 binding to PD-L1 or B7 on APC is primarily a mechanism producing anergy in effector T-cells in peripheral tissues, including tumors. In fact, many malignant cells express PD-L1 in order to evade being killed by T-cells.
-  PD-1 = > anergy in effector t cells 

 An enterovirus protein has antigenic similarity to an antigen expressed on beta islet cells.
 An immune response to the virus (in those with genetic predisposing factors) results in an immune response that also attacks the person's beta islet cells leading to Type I diabetes. 
 - Bystander activation or epitope spreading (these are related mechanisms) would be possible if the enterovirus replicated in the pancreas, but it didn't. 
 - In either case, central tolerance failed to delete all self-reactive lymphocytes, allowing them to be activated in the periphery when co-stimulatory molecules were being expressed. The pancreas is not an immune privileged tissue.

lymphocyte maturation
common lymphoid progen (has multiple b/t receptors) -> pro-b/t cells -> we can become an immature b/t cells
- but the determining factor - how strongly it binds with the receptor
- weak antigen recognition -> mature t/b cell
- strong antigen recog = negative selection
when lymphocytes see the antigen they recognize they can get activatied = immune response, 
inactivated / die = immunological tolerance
no response/change = immunological ignorance 

immune receptors - recognize self antigens - **presented by antigen presenting cells with antibodies made by b cells**
immunological tolerance - lack of response to antigens induced by exposure of lymphocytes to these antigens - via the adaptive immune system
- same antigen can induce immune tol or immune responsiveness depending on context (dose/method of delivery)
- mechanisms + therapies will exploit this process to make these tolerant to induce these things. 
tolerance != immunodef/suppression
- tolerance - Antigen specific, property of t/b lymphocytes, and physiologically normal + perm 
- immunodef/suppression - not antigen specific, and can affect both innate/adaptive. can be induced/pathological + reversible. 

mechanisms of induction
- STAGE 1 - central tolerance - occurs in primary lymphoid organs like bone marrow/thymus = **inside these are immature lymphocytes**... if it retains ability to recognize self antigen it either apoptosis or changes receptors when it's a b cell 
	- thymus = t cells = 
		- stem cell -> double neg (no cd4/8) -> pre - tcell receptor -> double poz (cd4,8) -> 
			- weak recognition of MHC 2 and peptide via antigen presenting cells -> deletion of CD8 receptor becoming poz selection for CD4+ mature T cell 
				- small node - only cd4+ can become t regulatory cells which escape out in the thymus and into periphery in spite of negative selection
			- weak recognition of MHC 1 -> delete 4, become CD8+ cell
			- no recognition of MHC+ peptide => apoptosis, **death by neglect**
			- strong recognition of either -> apoptosis, neg selection
	- bone marrow = b cells
		- we can have apoptosis with auto-reactivity 
		- receptor editing - for b cells only - we tweak it a bit! 
			- we have the Rag gene reactivated, which allows us to rearrange a new light chain formation- > old heavy chain + changes in new light chain that allows for new speciifcity . if editing fails, then we have deletion 
		- fyi - tolerance of b cells that recognize many things like membrane proteins can be induced in t cell independent manner, and self proteins may not elicit autoantibody responses bc of tolerance in **both b and helper t cells**
			- **diseases associated with autoantibodies like SLE - defect in tolerance in BOTH b+helper T cells, NOT JUST a b cell problem!**
	- self antigen needs to be present in them to build this tolerance




- STAGE 2 - in the periphery , peripheral tolerance is built in the mature lymphocytes
	- they can become anergic, undergo apoptosis, or the **regulatory t lymphocytes cd4+ earlier can suppress them**
		- anergy - long lived state f unresponsiveness to antigenic stim in lymphocytes.  when t-reg cells have cell-cell contact with APCs that express CTLA-4 which removes B7 molecules CD80/86 from APC by trans-endocytosis 
			- antigenic signaling in absence of co-stim, or with any engagement in the inhibitory receptors CTLA-4/PD-1
			- RECALL: activation of t cells need antigen of TCR/CD3 complex + **costimulation by B7 CD80/86 via CD28** = any perturbation = anergy
				- no 2nd costimulatory signal or CTLA-4 binding = > anergy. 
				- CTLA-4 will be on that T-reg binding to that APC's B7 = this will eat up the B7  = **competitive inhibitor; secondary lymphoid organs**
					- mutation of CTLA4- CTLA4 haploinsufficiency - impaired reg t cell function 
				- PD-1 , not expressed on t-regs , inhibits any signals from TCR complex + CD28 = taking away that secondary stimulation, so in effector phase = **signaling inhibitor; *peripheral tissues!!!***. CD8>CD4+ 
		- t reg suppression - they develop in the thymus + periphery. these inhibit activation of other lymphocytes like t cells
			- they have Foxp3 = **if you get mutation, cause systemic multiorg dz IPEX syndrome** - this is deficiency of regulatory t cells 
			- CD25 high = alpha chain for IL-2R , requires IL-2 for maintenance of reg cell presence
			- these can secrete **cytokines that blocks activation of macrophages/cells = IL-10, TGF-b and deplete IL-2/other inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1** ; 
		- activation induced cell cell death - peripheral t cell deletion = AICD = 
			- normally: antigen stimulates the apoptosc proteins, then IL-2 release there. which will inhibit the apoptosis. 
			- in absence of low/no-costim, we don't have IL-2, so we will have death because apoptotic proteins are allowed to be released
			- if you get a death receptor expression - we can have the t cells deletion quickly 
	- t cells - in order for them to become tolerant in the periphery we need the antigens presented. 
		- AIRE - autoimmune regulator gene, **ppl with a mutation in this can get an autoimmune dz**: *autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome* - these cause some peripheral tissue antigens to be expressed in the thymus - thymic epithelial cells 
			- APS-1 - reduced expression of peripheral tissue antigens in the thymus, leading to defective elim of self reactive t cells 
	- b cells: we can still have anergy, apoptosis , but uniquely we also get regulation by inhibitory receptors for those auto-reactive b cells. 
		- anergy - happens due to **lack of t cell help**
		- apoptosis - triggered by self antigens in periphery, happens with newly emerged transitional b cells (no proper receptor modulation, not mature yet.)

we need to make sure our tolerance is good to commensal microbes in our intestines + skin!!!
- esp in gut it's important! otherwise we get c. diff. 
- mature lymphocytes in these tissues can recognize these entities but don't react to them 
	- abundance of t-regs or physical separation from intestines/cutaneous immune systems like mucus, etc. keratin in skin 
	- we probably have a ton of mechanisms like release of cytokines that taper down our immune system or some other t reg cells etc 

tolerance to fetal antigens - we need to make sure - paternal antigens must be tolerated in maternal immune systems bc they're in the fetus 
 - FOXP + t-regs specific for paternal antigens 
 - exclusion of inflammatory cells from pregnant uterus 
 - poor antigen presentation happens in the placenta - so you may not even be able to get that activation 
 - low expression of conventional MHC I molecules  - which make CD8+ t cells 

autoimmunity - immune response against self antigens - happens 3-5% , females mainly 
- genetic susceptibility - don't need to know mhc alleles associated with these - but we have SNPs , but polygenic + low permeance. very much rare but we see MHC and non MHC genes that are mutated 
	- FAS - autoimmmune lymphoproliferative syndrome alps; defective apoptosis of self reactive t and b cells of **periphery**
	- IL-10 mutations - infantile enterocolitis, defective suppression of immune responses to commensal bacteria 
- exposure to environmental triggers  like infections, which activate APCs of the tissues; or trauma / chemical exposure
	- induction of co-stim molecules on apc presenting self-antigens; 	- infections -> **rheumatoid arthritis, bc it will alter the proteins in the cell to make them recognized as non-self and elicit adaptive immune responses** 
	- trauma - activates innate system, results in recruiting and activating leukocytes at trauma site like gastroenteritis can be a trigger for some ibs
	- self-mimicry - microbe can look super similar to our self antigens, making those t cells then more self-reactive 
	- immune privileged sites - don't have self antigens that are in these areas, so thre's no activation there
		- basically infection/trauma can lead to injury and exposure to those sites, which releases antigens that are normally sequestered from immune system!
		- non-specific! doesn't require exposure to antigen for induction!!! like brain, eyes, testes, placenta/fetus
		- eye trauma -> release of intraocular proteins -> spreads to inflammation in the eye 
		- or trauma to testes - you can get autoimmune uvelitis or orchitis! the presentation of new self-antigens to the area
	- drugs - procainamide, quinidine etc - lupus like stufff 
	- some metals and some solvents - mercury, gold, silver ;; trichloroethylene 
	- diet/autoimmunity - some debates - Vita D - decreass that Th1 cell responses + inc T reg 
		- celiac dz - autoimmune dz triggered by glutin in ppl , igA autoantibodies
		- iodine - excess - inc iodinization of thyroglobulin - more immunogenic 

very complex.... circulating complexes of soluble self antigen + autoantibodies -> systemic dz, SLE 
autoantibodies/autoreactive t cells against specific organ -> hashimotos
pathogenesis variable - autoreactivity can lead to tissue injury + subsequent immune responses to additional antigens - **epitope spreading**
- immune complex
- circulating autoantibodies
- autoreactive t cells 

THERAPIES
- we need to block inflammatory proess from occurring 
- coritcosteroids, ANti-TNF/IL-1 
- costimulation blockage etc
