![[3. Introduction to Clinical Immunological Tests_Litwin_NOTES (1).pdf]]

this is on the TBL
- general approaches to management and treatment of these
- - interpretation of appropriate lab tests for some immune disorders 


basic tests we'd order every day for inflammation , etc 
==erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR and CRP = very sensitive but not specific, they're just acute phase reactants and can be elevated in many diseases== 
- ==ESR - how fast RSCs settle to bottom of tube in 1 hr? faster it settles = higher the ESR. so acute phase reactants would negate that charge and make cells sequester.== 
==measure - C3 - classic + alt pathways==
==measure - C4 - classic pathway only== 
- any ==activations of complement cascade, C3/4 **decreases** with complement activation secondary to immune complex disease bc it gets cleaved== - like HIV, autoantibody dz, vasculitis, SLE, 

rheumatoid arthritis
- ==rheumatoid factor - typically **IgM** against Fc portion of igG== 
- can also rarely be IgG/IgA = more severe dz
- ==**not specific, and can interfere with ELISA testing**==
newer test - ==anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide  **Anti-CCP wayyy better for rheumatoid arthritis==-** auto-antibodies directed against endogenous citrullinated peptides, highly sensitive + specific 

==connective tissue diseases - anti nuclear antibody testing - antibodies to specific parts of nucleus of cell==
- they order something when there's any inflammatory disease. we can have very specific patterns that correspond to different diseases 
- ==cytoplasmic/nucleolar pattern - SLE==
- and then we can look into any extracted antigens, to get more and more specific things 
- ==speckled pattern - the most nonspecific, can be caused by infections too==

==ANA - antinuclear antibody== - we do a cell line on slide, then serum of patient on it, then look at the fluorescence as the antibodies stick on tags
- homogenous pattern of fluorescence - ==anti-DNA antibodies/anti-histone - seen in drug induced lupus== 
- speckled - most common least specific 
- ==nucleolar pattern - systemic scleroderma==
- ==centromere pattern - CREST/limited variant of scleroderma== 

==Extractable nuclear antigens ENAs - can be done with the ANA, coat cells with extractable nuclei and extract all separate parts of nucleus==
- then add the patient antibodies to see if it sticks - shows a certain pattern or glow 

==ANCA - anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies - mostly for any **ANCA-associated vasculitis**==
- anca target + attack neutrophil cytoplasm 
- ==**if there's renal dysfunction in patient - do this stat.**== 
- can be **peripheral** in cytoplasm and cANCA - granulomatosis
- micropolyangiititis etc
- ==**p-ANCA = lobulated nucleus, perinuclear - myeloperoxidase is seen**== 
- ==**C-ANCA - cytoplasmic dye around the cytoplasm ; proteinase 3 is there**==

antiphospholipid antibodies - either IgG/M antibodies seen in abt 1/2 of  SLE
- react in wide variety - anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant
- ==**false poz test for syphilis due to these anticardiolipin, associated with 1/2 of SLE**==
- ==**antiphospholipid syndrome**- women lose many pregnancies due to abortions - this is the cause, venous and/or arterial thromboses== 
- **we only test for antiphospholipids when we have women having abortions/miscarriages** = **for coagulopathies and stuff causing thrombi/distal embolisms**

serum protein electrophoresis - serum is applied, electrophoresis + protein bands visualized 
- different peaks represent the weight of elements in the gel 
- ==SPEP patterns== - these have different peaks associated with what was going on. 
- ==**1st peak = albumin, 2nd = alpha -1, 3rd alpha-2, 4th peak = b-globulin(complement, fibrinogens, clotting etc) , 5th peak is gamma (immunoglobulins)**==
	- ==alpha 2 inc when gamma's not = acute inflammatory==
	- ==chronic inflammatory - when gamma starts to increase too bc this time you're making antibodies==
	- ==**monoclonal proteins - found in multiple myeloma - sharp peak seen**==
	- ==nephrotic syndromes + losing enteropathy - see a decrease in proteins== 
	- we would worry most about something when we see the peak that's BIGGER or equal to the very first one???

![[SPEP patterns.png]]
==immunofixation - used to determine the actual composition of the monoclonal spike== 
- 6 lanes overlayed with anti-sera 

capillary electrophoresis - run thru copper tubes, higher resolution, distinct peaks with more uv tests etc. 
- automated too 
- issue - no solid format for immunofixation so immunosubtraction is done instead. where you mix it with whatever. - harder to do. more time to look at it 

to dx tb infection - Tuberculin skin test, interferon gamma release assays
- ==type 4 hypersensitivity = tuberculin skin test - t cells - skin test , 2-3 days to see rxn== 
- ==PPD - crude protein used to detect the tb.== grew the mycobacteria in huge patch and then the proteins ... 
- you can get ==false poz to bcg, some immune reactivity to non tb mycobacteria ntms==
- in us born individuals some can have responses due to NTMs 
- false neg = improper intradermal injection, malnuourishment, disseminated tb disease!!!, immunocompromised 
==iGRAs==
- ==we isolate the t cells and check for memory t cell responsiveness to release gamma interferon== 
	- quantiferon tb, and t spot - 
- these are ==specific for tb- these are not false poz.== 
- m. marinum, szulgai, and kansasii - these are the only false poz on the test. 

- ==QFT -==
	- ==neg control - look for bgd IFN-g, bc u can have that with uncontrolled hiv etc.== 
	- latest gen of that - 2 tb - exposes whole blood to that antigen - 1 and 2 tubes
	- poz control - mitogen tube - to indicate immune status etc 
	- ==incubate whole blood overnight. add the antigens - wait for them to make interferon-g.== 
	- measure amount of interferon -g and then measure that rxn 
	- indeterminate result = test didn't work. ppl can also have low poz or high neg 
	- ==typical poz - NIL low (normal ppl have big response to mitogen) ; then subtract the TB Ag - Nil = more than 10 basically== 
	- ==typical neg - low nil, tb ag low , mitogen 10+== 
	- ==indeteminant - if Nil high, may be due to recent illness== 
	- low mitogen - hiv poz? result of less t cell energy? latent tb? or did they not shake the tube
==alternate test - T-spot, count the dots== 
- ==collect blood mononuclear cells , add these to a big titer well, then it's coated with IFN-g receptors==, and then we see if there's a lot- you count the spots to find the amounts.
