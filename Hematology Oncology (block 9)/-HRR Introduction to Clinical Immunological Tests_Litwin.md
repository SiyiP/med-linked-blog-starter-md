basic tests we'd order every day for inflammation , etc 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR and CRP = very sensitive but not specific, they're just acute phase reactants and can be elevated in many diseases 
- ESR - how fast RSCs settle to bottom of tube in 1 hr? faster it settles = higher the ESR. so acute phase reactants would negate that charge and make cells sequester. 
C3 - classic + alt pathways
C4 - classic pathway only 
- any activations of complement cascade, C3/4 decreases with complement activation secondary to immune complex disease - like HIV, autoantibody dz, vasculitis, SLE, 

rheumatoid arthritis
- rheumatoid factor - typically IgM against Fc portion of igG 
- can also rarely be IgG/IgA = more severe dz
- not specific, and can interfere with ELISA testing
newer test - anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide - auto-antibodies directed against endogenous citrullinated peptides, highly sensitive + specific 

connective tissue diseases - anti nuclear antibody testing - antibodies to specific parts of nucleus of cell
- they order something when there's any inflammatory disease. we can have very specific patterns that correspond to different diseases 
- cytoplasmic/nucleolar pattern - SLE
- and then we can look into any extracted antigens, to get more and more speicific things 
- speckled pattern - the most nonspecific, can be caused by infections too

ANA - antinuclear antibody - we do a cell line on slide, then serum of patient on it, then look at the fluoresence as the antibodies stick on tags
- homogenous pattern of fluoresence - anti-DNA antibodies/anti-histone - seen in drug induced lupus 
- speckled - most common least specific 
- nucleolar pattern - scleroderma
- centromere pattern - CREST variant of scleroderma 

Extractable nuclear antigens ENAs - can be done with the ANA, coat cells with extractable nuclei and extract all separate parts of nucleus
- then add the patient antibodies to see if it sticks

ANCA - anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies - mostly for any ANCA-associated vasculitis
- anca target + attack neutrophil cytoplasm 
- renal dysfunction in patient - do this stat. 
- can be peripheral in cytoplasm and cANCA - granulomatosis
- micropolyangiititis etc
- p-ANCA = lobulated nucleas, perinuclear - myeloperoxidase is seen 
- C-ANCA - cytoplasmic dye around the cytoplasm ; proteinase 3 is there

antiphospholipid antibodies - either IgG/M antibodies seen in abt 1/2 of  SLE
- react in wide variety - anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant
- false poz test for syphilis due to these anticardiolipin
- **antiphospholipid syndrome**- women lose many pregnancies due to abortions - this is the cause, venous and/or arterial thromboses 

serum protein electrophoresis - serum is applied, electrophoresis + protein bands visuzlied 
- different peaks represent the weight of elements in the gel 
- SPEP patterns - these have different peaks associated with what was going on. 
- 1st peak = albumin, 2nd = alpha -1, 3rd alpha-2, 4th peak = b-globulin(complement, fibrinogens, clotting etc) , 5th peak is gamma (immunoglobulins)
	- alpha 2 inc when gamma's not = acute inflammatory 
	- chronic infalmmatory - when gamma starts to increase too bc this time you're making antibodies
	- monoclonal proteins - found in multiple myeloma - **sharp peak seen**
	- nephrotic syndromes + losing enteropathy - see a decrease in proteins 

![[SPEP patterns.png]]
immunofixation - used to determine the actual composition of the monoclonal spike 
- 6 lanes overlayed with anti-sera 

capillary electrophoresis - run thru copper tubes, highr resolution, distinct peaks with more uv tests etc. 
- automated too 
- issue - no solid format for immunofixation so immunosubtraction is done instead. where you mix it with whatever. - harder to do. more time to look at it 

to dx tb infeciton - Tuberculin skin test, interferon gamma release assays
- type 4 - t cells - skin test , 2-3 days to see rxn 
- PPD - crude protein used to detect the tb. grew the mycobacteria in huge patch and then the proteins ... 
- you can get false poz to bcg, some immune reactivity to non tb mycobacteria ntms
- in us born individuals some can have responses due to NTMs 
- false neg = improper intradermal injection, malnuourishment, disseminated tb disease!!!, immunocompromised 
iGRAs
- we isolate the t cells and check for memory t cell responsiveness to release gamma interferon 
	- quantiferon tb, and t spot - 
- these are speific for tb- these are not false poz. 
- m. marinum, szulgai, and kansasii - these are the only false poz on the test. 
- QFT -
	- neg control - look for bgd IFN-g, bc u can have that with uncontrolled hiv etc. 
	- latest gen of that - 2 tb - exposes whole blood to that antigen - 1 and 2 tubes
	- poz control - mitogen tube - to indicate immune status etc 
	- incubate whole blood overnight. add the antigens - wait for them to make interferon-g. 
	- measure amount of interferon -g and then measure that rxn 
	- indeterminate. - test didn't work. ppl can also have low poz or high neg 
	- typical poz - NIL low, normal ppl have big response to mitogen ; then subtract the TB Ag - Nil = more than 10 basically 
	- typical neg - low nil, tb ag low , mitogen 10+ 
	- indeteminant - if Nil high, may be due to recent illness 
	- low mitogen - hiv poz? result of less t cell energy? latent tb? or did they not shake the tube
alternate test - T-spot 
- collect blood mononuclear cells , add these to a big titer well, then it's coated with IFN-g receptors, and then we see if there's a lot- you count the spots to find the amounts.
