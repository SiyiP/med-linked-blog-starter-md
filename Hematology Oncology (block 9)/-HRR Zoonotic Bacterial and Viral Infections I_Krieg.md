![[4. Zoonotic Bacterial & Viral Infections I and II_Krieg_NOTES (1).pdf]]

zoonotic viruses are transmitted by arthropods = arboviruses 
infections transmitted into humans + from animals - spread between animals + ppl 
- rural + semi-urban settings 
- expansion too into closeness to wildlife. 
modes of transmission 
– Direct inoculation (ie rabies, Pasteurella) 
– Environmental contamination (ie anthrax spores) 
– Ingestion (ie listeriosis, brucellosis) 
– By a vector (fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, lice) leading to infection (ie plague)

for the ==flaviviridae==
- ==the human. = "dead-end host"==
- all are ==flaviviruses (+ssRNA) spread by aedes mosquitos==, which are mostly limited to ==tropical/sub-tropical zones + feed in daylight hours==
	- range of the mosquito = in the south; but the us has largely eraticated it unless it's in the caribbean travels 

==arthropod virus  = arboviruses, all got 3 symptoms== - hundreds of them, divided into 3 arbitrary clinical syndromes = **all are flaviviruses**
- ==fevers +/- maculopapular rash + benign==
- ==encephalitis , high case fatality rate==
- ==hemorrhagic fevers ; severe + fatal== 
1. ==dengue virus = a lot in florida. "breakbone fevers"== - high fevers w headache/retro-orbital pain."
	- ==acute phase 3-6 days post-infection = can get shock, bleeding== etc. 
	- ==**severe muscle+joint pain** for 2-10 days w/ prolonged convalescence/ercovery== 
	- ==rarely fatal + treatment symptomatic (:== 
	- note ANTIbody enhanced infection: ==Type 1 first transmission Dengue: **mild febrile illness = antibody response and recovery**==
		- after recovery, what can happen is dengue type 2 => basically antibody enhances infection, inc type 2 infection of **monocytes**, inc cytokines
		- **that's how we get hemorrhagic fever shock syndromes + severe illness**
			- DHF = **dengue hemorrhagic fever**
			- enhanced immune rxn bc of DEN1-4, antibodies beforehand. macrophage uptake the virus = worse disease. 
			- hemorrhage + vascular leak = petechiae, nosebleeds, gingival bleeds, purpura, gi = low platelets + hemoconcentration + neutropenia  
			- **low blood pressure = DENgue shock syndrome**
2. yellow fever virus 
	- issue with diagnosis - we only detect the top 5% with symptoms like jaundice, fever, hemorrhage etc BUT 85% are asymptomatic!!! still **transmit via blood transfusion.**
	- incubation 2-6 days in humans, 7-10 in mosquito 
	- 2 phase illness
		- 1-3 day = infection of liver, abrupt flu like symptoms onset, then **relative bradycardia = faget's sign(bradycardia + fever)** => leukopenia + proteinuria 
		- remission day 
		- 4-10 = intoxication = fever, prostration, **GI bleeding black vomit**, delirium, **JAUNDICE**, petechiae, hypotension, shock 
		- 10 - 21 = death or convalescence if survived = fatigue, secondary pneumonia, full hepatic recovery 
	- THERE IS A VACCINE! check on the CDC for travel = one dose = lifelong protection, give it 9+ months of age 
3. chikungunya virus = ppl infected mostly become symptomatic. 
	- acute onset of fever + polyarthralgia, joint symptoms bilateral/symmetric but severe and debilitating 
	- **cannot differentiate from dengue unless we take these labs/PCR test:** lymphopenia , thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, hepatic transaminases
	- mortality is rare tho 
4. Zika virus - 
	- asymptomatic/nonspecific fever w/ maculopapular rash, headache, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, rarely severe
	- **Guillain barre syndrome(ascending paralysis) inc incidence**
	- congenital infection = severe = **microcephaly, blindness, death**
	- transmission by sexual contact as well as blood transfusion = documented 
TREATMENT: no antivirals, all symptomatic. only one vaccine for yellow fever + prevention via mosquito repellants + control w/ community 


arthropod bacterial - many have unusual animal reservoir.  
1. Yersinia pestis – "black death"
	- human is accidental host, if they're close to rats, fleas that are on the rats go to bite you, transmitting it to you. 
	- reservoir/host = small mammals. humans accidentally... 
	- Fever, acute, chills, then varied symptoms 
	- TREAT: gentamycin/streptomycin 
	- **YOPs** = outer proteins of yersinia inhibits phagocytosis, inducing macrophage apoptosis = disarm of innate immune system 
		- ==**type 3 secretion** = insertion of yops into phagocytes==
		- ==**F1** = anti-phagocytic capsular protein== 
	- if bubonic vers - buboes = massively enlarged **lymph nodes** , full of bacteria + gram-neg stained 
	- if pneumonic version - **airborne, infects the lungs** -> pneumonic plague. 
		- ==100% mortality if not treated!! person-person and it's hypoxia of extremities== 
		- majorly concentrated in the west called four corners, mostly bubonic, but can be accompanied by dyspnea + nonproductive cough. 
	
Rickettsia overview 
	- **small gram-neg poorly staining**
	- obligate intracellular parasites of endothelial cells in humans, require living cells as hosts so no agar, hard to grow. 
	- ==OMP + phospholipase mediate entry into the endothelial cells of microvessels at site of bite/scratch - > **cause endothelial injury , vascular perm, loss of fluids = shock!**==
	- CDC - tick bite bot = helps you remove them + helps you decide where to find care - helpful resource! 
- ==body louse + flea + hard tick  = transmitters== 
1. Rickettsiae rickettsii – rocky mountain spotted fever 
	- infected (hard body) tick bite 
	- more common <19 yrs, in summertime, more east 
	- non-specific flu-like symptoms can progress to life threatening, **one of only a few that causes a rash on palms+soles**
	- TREAT: petechial rash is a late symptom, but if you're suspicious, get doxycycline immediately 
2. Rickettsiae prowazekii – primary louse-borne typhus + brill-zinsser disease 
	- infected LOUSE feces scratched into skin/inhaled, rare, but in the US associated with pet flying squirrels 
	- **epidemic typhus** + sudden spread ; symptoms such as RMSF but **no rashes on palms/hands/face**
	- latent infection = **brill zinsser dz**
	- TREAT: tetracycline 
3. Rickettsiae typhi – murine typhus 
	- **endemic typhus** - rat flea, cat flea, mouse flea. reservoir opossums, dogs, cats + fleas get infected when they bite those **reservoir animals** 
		- endemic to so-cal, tx, hawaii 
	- infected FLEA bite 
	- TREAT: doxycycline 
4. Ehrlichia chaffeensis - "rickettsia-like"
	- transmitted by ixodes tick

	- host in: humans, dogs, ruminants, horses 
6. Bartonella quintana = "trench fever"
	- host/reservoir in humans - transmitted by **human body louse**, **intracellular growth inside erythrocytes**
	- fever, headache, rash on **trunk/abdomen**, bone pain mainly in shins, neck, back, with **recovery in 5 days then relapse**
	- g-neg coccobacilli, fastidious microaerophillic but 21 days to grow
	- DX: pcr/antibodies bc culture too slow 
	- TREAT: azithromycin/erythromycin 
7. recurrent: borrelia recurrentis + burgdorferi spirochetes from block 6 

---
zoonotic bacterial infections transmitted by animal bites/body fluids
1. bartonella henselae- "cat scratch dz"
	- gram neg coccobaccili **related by brucella**
	- domestic + feral housecats infected by fleabites = host/reservoir. transmission by scratches of infected cats 
	- enlarged, tender lymph nodes that develop 1-3 wks after exposure, and scab/pustule at scratch site 
	- g-neg coccobacilli, fastidious microaerophillic but 21 days to grow like the other in its family + intracellular erythrocyte growth 
	- TREAT: Azithromycin but CSD resolves without treatment 
2. Brucella abortus – 
	- cattle , pigs, goats hold it, but transmitted by unpasteurized milk/infected carcasses 
		- abortis = cattle
		- suis = pigs
		- melitensis = goats/sheep = found in most ppl commonly 
		- canis = dogs 
	- DX: hard bc blood culture takes 3 days- 4 wks to be poz  
	- gradual onset of symptoms 2-4 wks post exposure, undulant fevers, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, backpain, anorexia. **classically have malodorous sweat** 
	- g-neg coccobacilli, fastigdious aeroobic 
	- TREAT: tetracyclines 
	- virulence: smooth LPS  allows for intracellular growth, survives macrocytic vesicle in attack + replicates in lymph nodes  or cleared or seeds chronic infection in nearly any tissue. 
3. Pasteurella multocida – "soft tissue infection/bite wound"
	- cat/dog oral cavities reservoir + transmission by bites/scratches - normal oral flora 
	- rapidly prog cellulitis + lymphangitis within 24 hrs of the bite, pneumonia also possible ; erythematous streaks up the arm 
	- g-neg coccobacilus, facultative anaerobe, might exhibit bipolar staining 
	- DX: culture but start empriric therapy 
	- TREAT: penicillins AMOXicillin-clavulonic acid
	- virulence: capsule inhibits phagocytosis, LPS, **siderophores(iron scavenging) against innate immunity** 
4. Coxiella burnettii – "q fever"
	- cattle/sheep goats reservoir but transmission via contaminated **dust**/aerosols 
	- usually mild systemic infection without rash; chronic pneumonia + myocarditis possible 
	- g-neg bacillus , hard to get it out of the soil 
	- DX: serology, BSL3 org
	- TREAT: doxycycline + chloramphenicol 
	- virulence: intracllular replication in phagolysosomes of macrophage 
5. Francisella tularensis - cattle/sheep/goats/rabbits/wild mammals - transmission by infected carcasses + ticks/deer flies or inhalation or ingestion or trauma 
	- fever, chills, malaise 2-5 days post exposure + **necrosis, abscess + granulomas**
		- ulceroglandular = papule -> painful ulcer + regional lymphadenopathy 
		- oculoglandular - painful purulent conjunctivitis
		- typhoidal = from ingesting large dose - typhoid fever mimic
		- pneumonic - if inhaled / hematogenous spread
		- septicemic - if it reaches the blood 
	- g-neg coccobacilli, facultative anaerobe, fails on routine media 
	- DX: clinical sus + special medium or serology 
	- TREAT: gentamycin/streptomycin IV 
	- virulence: low infectious dose + **polysach capsule/intracellular growth in macrophages + hepatocytes**
		- LPS not recognized by human's TLR. hides inside immune cells 
	- natural infection = long lasting immunity -
zoonotic viral infections transmitted by animal bites/body fluids
6. Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) – 
	- reservoir host - like a fruit bat natural host pre-outbreak, then they get the fruits, which get to the small mammal population, and then humans eat them.
		- human to human spread = physical contact or troplets 
	- much can be contained by training ppl to recognize symptoms and isolate ppl early 
	- enveloped, filamentous, helical neg-sense ssRNA 
	- 60% mortality rate from hemorrhagic fever + shock 
	- TREAT: single dose ebola virus vaccine, monoclonal abx against spike protein 
	1. ebola - 
	2. marburg - 
7. Hantavirus - 
	- in the us, -ssRNA
	- rodent reservoir + transmission thru inhaling rodent exreta/direct skin contact 
	- old world species = hemorrhagic fever v. new world = hantavirua pulmonary syndrome in the us = high mortality 
		- "sin nombre virus" in the four corners region 
		- we got black creek hantavirus with the mice here 
		- pulm syndrome - **non specific flu like symptomes then 4-10 days later SOB + resp failure. only supportive care available**
			- no human to human transmission reported. 
	- prevention - mask+gloves , ventilation be4 and during work, avoid aerosols, use water + disinfectants.
