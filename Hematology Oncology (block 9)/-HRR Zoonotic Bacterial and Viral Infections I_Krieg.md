![[4. Zoonotic Bacterial & Viral Infections I and II_Krieg_NOTES (1).pdf]]
zoonosis - has global pandemic impact! 
zoonotic viruses are transmitted by arthropods = arboviruses 
infections transmitted into humans + frmo animals - spread between animals + ppl 
- rural + semi-urban settings 
- expansion too into closeness to wildlife. 
modes of transmission 
– Direct inoculation (ie rabies, Pasteurella) 
– Environmental contamination (ie anthrax spores) 
– Ingestion (ie listeriosis, brucellosis) 
– By a vector (fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, lice) leading to infection (ie plague)

for the flaviviridae
- the human. = dead-end host
- all are flaviviruses (+ssRNA) spread by aedes mosquitos, which are mostly limited to tropical/sub-tropical zones + feed in daylight hours
	- range of the mosquito = in the south; but the us has largely eraticated it unless it's in the caribbean travels 

arthropod virus  = arboviruses - hundreds of them, divided into 3 arbitrary clinical syndromes = **all are flaviviruses**
- fevers +/- maculopapular rash + benign
- encephalitis , high case fatality rate
- hemorrhagic fevers ; severe + fatal 
1. dengue virus = a lot in florida. "breakbone fevers - high fevers w headache/retro-orbital pain."
	- acute phase 3-6 days post-infection = can get shock, bleeding etc. 
	- **severe muscle+joint pain** for 2-10 days w/ prolonged convalescence 
	- rarely fatal + treatment symptomatic (: 
	- note ANTIbody enhanced infection: **mild febrile illness = antibody response to type 1 , and recovery**
		- after recovery, what can happen is dengue type 2 => basically antibody enhances infection, inc type 2 infection of **monocytes**, inc cytokines
		- **that's how we get hemorrhagic fever shock syndromes + severe illness**
			- DHF = **dengue hemorrhagic fever**
			- enhanced immune rxn bc of DEN1-4, antibodies beforehand. macrophage uptake the virus = worse disease. 
			- hemorrhage + vascular leak = petechiae, nosebleeds, gingival bleeds, purpura, gi = low platelets + hemoconcentration + neutropenia  
			- **low blood pressure = DENgue shock syndrome**
2. yellow fever virus 
	- issue with diagnosis - we only detect the top 5% with symptoms like jaundice, fever, hemorrhage etc BUT 85% are asymptomatic!!! still **transmit via blood transfusion.**
	- incubation 2-6 days in humans, 7-10 in mosquito 
	- 2 phase ilness
		- 1-3 day = infection of liver, abrupt flu like symptoms onset, then **relative bradycardia = faget's sign** => leukopenia + proteinuria 
		- remission day 
		- 4-10 = intoxication = fever, prostration, **GI bleeding black vomit**, delirium, **JAUNDICE**, petechiae, hypotension, shock 
		- 10 - 21 = death or convalescence = fatigue, secondary pneumonia, full hepatic recovery 
3. chikungunya virus 
4. lassa virus 

arthropod bacterial 
1. Yersinia pestis – 
2. Rickettsiae rickettsii – 
3. Rickettsiae prowazekii – 
4. Rickettsiae typhi –
5. Ehrlichia chaffeensis 
6. Anaplasma phagocytophilium – 
7. Bartonella quintana
8. recurrent: borrelia recurrentis + burgdorferi spirochetes from block 6
