![[4. Zoonotic Bacterial & Viral Infections I and II_Krieg_NOTES (1).pdf]]
zoonosis - has global pandemic impact! 
zoonotic viruses are transmitted by arthropods = arboviruses 
infections transmitted into humans + frmo animals - spread between animals + ppl 
- rural + semi-urban settings 
- expansion too into closeness to wildlife. 
modes of transmission 
– Direct inoculation (ie rabies, Pasteurella) 
– Environmental contamination (ie anthrax spores) 
– Ingestion (ie listeriosis, brucellosis) 
– By a vector (fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, lice) leading to infection (ie plague)

for the flaviviridae
- the human. = dead-end host
- all are flaviviruses (+ssRNA) spread by aedes mosquitos, which are mostly limited to tropical/sub-tropical zones + feed in daylight hours
	- range of the mosquito = in the south; but the us has largely eraticated it unless it's in the caribbean travels 

arthropod virus  = arboviruses - hundreds of them, divided into 3 arbitrary clinical syndromes = **all are flaviviruses**
- fevers +/- maculopapular rash + benign
- encephalitis , high case fatality rate
- hemorrhagic fevers ; severe + fatal 
1. dengue virus = a lot in florida. "breakbone fevers - high fevers w headache/retro-orbital pain."
	- acute phase 3-6 days post-infection = can get shock, bleeding etc. 
	- **severe muscle+joint pain** for 2-10 days w/ prolonged convalescence 
	- rarely fatal + treatment symptomatic (: 
	- note ANTIbody enhanced infection: **mild febrile illness = antibody response to type 1 , and recovery**
		- after recovery, what can happen is dengue type 2 => basically antibody enhances infection, inc type 2 infection of **monocytes**, inc cytokines
		- **that's how we get hemorrhagic fever shock syndromes + severe illness**
			- DHF = **dengue hemorrhagic fever**
			- enhanced immune rxn bc of DEN1-4, antibodies beforehand. macrophage uptake the virus = worse disease. 
			- hemorrhage + vascular leak = petechiae, nosebleeds, gingival bleeds, purpura, gi = low platelets + hemoconcentration + neutropenia  
			- **low blood pressure = DENgue shock syndrome**
2. yellow fever virus 
	- issue with diagnosis - we only detect the top 5% with symptoms like jaundice, fever, hemorrhage etc BUT 85% are asymptomatic!!! still **transmit via blood transfusion.**
	- incubation 2-6 days in humans, 7-10 in mosquito 
	- 2 phase ilness
		- 1-3 day = infection of liver, abrupt flu like symptoms onset, then **relative bradycardia = faget's sign** => leukopenia + proteinuria 
		- remission day 
		- 4-10 = intoxication = fever, prostration, **GI bleeding black vomit**, delirium, **JAUNDICE**, petechiae, hypotension, shock 
		- 10 - 21 = death or convalescence if survived = fatigue, secondary pneumonia, full hepatic recovery 
	- THERE IS A VACCINE! check on the CDC for travel = one dose = lifelong protection, give it 9+ months of age 
3. chikungunya virus = ppl infected mostly become symptomatic. 
	- acute onset of fever + polyarthralgia, joint symptoms bilateral/symmetric but severe and debilitating 
	- **cannot differentiate from dengue unless we take these labs/PCR test:** lymphopenia , thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, hepatic transaminases
	- mortality is rare tho 
4. Zika virus - 
	- asymptomatic/nonspecific fever w/ maculopapular rash, headache, conunctivitis, arthralgias, rarely severe
	- **guillain barre syndrome inc incidence**
	- congenital infection = severe = **microcephaly, blindness, death**
	- transmission by sexual contact as well as blood transfusion = documented 
TREATMENT: no antivirals, all symptomatic. only one vaccine for yellow fever + prevention via mosquito repellants + control w/ community 


arthropod bacterial - many have unusual animal reservoir.  
1. Yersinia pestis – "black death"
	- human is accidental host, if they're close to rats, fleas that are on the rats go to bite you, transmitting it to you. 
	- reservir/host = small mammals. humans accidentally... 
	- Fever, acute, chills, then varied symptoms 
	- TREAT: gentamycin/streptomycin 
	- **YOPs** = outer proteins of yersinia inhibits phagocytosis, inducing macrophage apoptosis = disarm of innate immune system 
		- **type 3 secretion** = insertion of yops into phagocytes
		- **F1** = anti-phagocytic capsular protein 
	- if bubonic vers - buboes = massively enlarged **lymph nodes** , full of bacteria + gram-neg stained 
	- if pneumonic version - **airborne, infects the lungs** -> pneumonic plague. 
		- 100% mortality if not treated!! person-person and it's hypoxia of extremities 
		- majorly concentrated in the west called four corners, mostly bubonic, but can be accompanied by dyspnea + nonproductive cough. 
	Rickettsia overview 
	- **small gram-neg poorly staining**
	- obligate intracellular parasites of endothelial cells in humans, require living cells as hosts so no agar, hard to grow. 
	- OMP + phospholipase mediate entry into the endothelial cells of microvessels at site of bite/scratch - > **cause endotheilial injury , vascular perm, loss of fluids = shock!**
	- CDC - tick bite bot = helps you remove them + helps you decide where to find care - helpful resource! 
- body louse + flea + hard tick  = transmitters 
1. Rickettsiae rickettsii – rocky mountain spotted fever 
	- infected (hard body) tick bite 
	- more common <19 yrs, in summertime, more east 
	- non-specific flu-like symptoms can progress to life threatening, **one of only a few that causes a rash on palms+soles**
	- TREAT: petechial rash is a late symptom, but if you're suspicious, get doxycycline immediately 
2. Rickettsiae prowazekii – primary louse-borne typhus + brill-zinsser disease 
	- infected LOUSE feces scratched into skin/inhaled, rare, but in the US associated with pet flying squirrels 
	- **epidemic typhus** + sudden spread ; symptoms such as RMSF but **no rashes on palms/hands/face**
	- latent infection = **brill zinsser dz**
	- TREAT: tetracycline 
3. Rickettsiae typhi – murine typhus 
	- **endemic typhus** - rat flea, cat flea, mouse flea. reservoir opossums, dogs, cats + fleas get infected when they bite those **reservoir animals** 
		- endemic to socal, tx, hawaii 
	- infected FLEA bite 
	- TREAT: doxycycline 
4. Ehrlichia chaffeensis 
5. Anaplasma phagocytophilium – 
6. Bartonella quintana = 
7. recurrent: borrelia recurrentis + burgdorferi spirochetes from block 6
