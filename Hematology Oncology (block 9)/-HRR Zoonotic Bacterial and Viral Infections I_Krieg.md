![[4. Zoonotic Bacterial & Viral Infections I and II_Krieg_NOTES (1).pdf]]

zoonotic viruses are transmitted by arthropods = arboviruses 
infections transmitted into humans + from animals - spread between animals + ppl 
- rural + semi-urban settings 
- expansion too into closeness to wildlife. 
modes of transmission 
– Direct inoculation (ie rabies, Pasteurella) 
– Environmental contamination (ie anthrax spores) 
– Ingestion (ie listeriosis, brucellosis) 
– By a vector (fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, lice) leading to infection (ie plague)

for the ==flaviviridae==
- ==the human. = "dead-end host"==
- all are ==flaviviruses (+ssRNA) spread by aedes mosquitos==, which are mostly limited to ==tropical/sub-tropical zones + feed in daylight hours==
	- range of the mosquito = in the south; but the us has largely eraticated it unless it's in the caribbean travels 

==arthropod virus  = arboviruses, all got 3 symptoms== - hundreds of them, divided into 3 arbitrary clinical syndromes = **all are flaviviruses**
- ==fevers +/- maculopapular rash + benign==
- ==encephalitis , high case fatality rate==
- ==hemorrhagic fevers ; severe + fatal== 
1. ==dengue virus = a lot in florida. "breakbone fevers"== - high fevers w headache/retro-orbital pain."
	- ==acute phase 3-6 days post-infection = can get shock, bleeding== etc. 
	- ==**severe muscle+joint pain** for 2-10 days w/ prolonged convalescence/ercovery== 
	- ==rarely fatal + treatment symptomatic (:== 
	- note ANTIbody enhanced infection: ==Type 1 first transmission Dengue: **mild febrile illness = antibody response and recovery**==
		- ==after recovery, what can happen is dengue type 2 => basically antibody enhances infection, some **monocytes**, ultimately inc. cytokines==
		- **that's how we get hemorrhagic fever shock syndromes + severe illness**
			- ==DHF = **dengue hemorrhagic fever**==
			- ==enhanced immune rxn bc of DEN1-4, antibodies beforehand. macrophage uptake the virus = worse disease.== 
			- ==hemorrhage + vascular leak = petechiae, nosebleeds, gingival bleeds, purpura, gi = low platelets + hemoconcentration + neutropenia==  
			- ==**low blood pressure = DENgue shock syndrome**==
2. ==yellow fever virus== 
	- issue with diagnosis - ==we only detect the top 5% with symptoms like jaundice, fever, hemorrhage etc BUT 85% are asymptomatic contagious==!!! still **transmit via blood transfusion.**
	- ==incubation 2-6 days in humans, 7-10 in mosquito== 
	- ==2 phase illness==
		- ==1-3 day = infection of liver, abrupt flu== like symptoms onset, then ==**relative bradycardia = faget's sign(bradycardia + fever)** => leukopenia + proteinuria== 
		- ==remission day== 
		- ==4-10 = intoxication = fever, prostration, **GI bleeding black vomit**, delirium, **JAUNDICE**, petechiae, hypotension, shock== 
		- ==10 - 21 days = death or convalescence if survived== = fatigue, secondary pneumonia, full hepatic recovery 
	- THERE IS A VACCINE! check on the CDC for travel = ==one vaccine dose = lifelong protection, give it 9+ months of age== 
3. ==chikungunya virus== = ppl infected mostly become symptomatic. 
	- ==acute onset of fever + *polyarthralgia*, joint symptoms bilateral/symmetric but severe and debilitating== 
	- ==**cannot differentiate from dengue unless we take these labs/PCR test:** lymphopenia , thrombocytopenia, **elevated creatinine**, hepatic transaminases==
	- ==mortality is rare tho== 
4. ==Zika virus -== 
	- ==asymptomatic/nonspecific fever w/ maculopapular rash, headache, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, rarely severe==
	- **==risk up for **Guillain barre syndrome(ascending paralysis)== inc incidence**
	- ==congenital infection = severe = **microcephaly, blindness, death**==
	- transmission by ==sexual contact + blood transfusion== = documented 
==TREATMENT for all flaviviridae: no antivirals, all symptomatic==. only one vaccine for yellow fever + prevention via mosquito repellants + control w/ community 


==arthropod bacterial== - many have unusual animal reservoir.  
1. ==Yersinia pestis – "black death", g-neg staining==
	- human = accidental host, if they're close to rats, ==fleas that are on the rats go to bite you==, transmitting it to you. 
	- ==reservoir/host = small mammals. humans accidentally...== 
	- ==Fever, acute, chills, then varied symptoms== 
	- ==TREAT: gentamycin/streptomycin== 
	- ==**YOPs** = outer proteins of yersinia inhibits phagocytosis = disarm of innate immune system with macrophage apoptosis== 
		- ==**type 3 secretion** = insertion of yops into phagocytes==
		- ==**F1** = anti-phagocytic capsular protein== 
	- if ==bubonic vers - buboes = massively enlarged **lymph nodes**== , full of bacteria + gram-neg stained 
	- if ==pneumonic version - **airborne, infects the lungs** -> pneumonic plague; dyspnea + nonproductive cough==. 
		- ==100% mortality if not treated!! person-person and it's hypoxia of extremities== 
		- majorly concentrated in the west called ==four corners==, mostly bubonic, but can be accompanied by dyspnea + nonproductive cough. 
	
==Rickettsia== overview 
	==- **small gram-neg poorly staining**==
	- ==obligate intracellular parasites of endothelial cells== in humans, require living cells as hosts so no agar, hard to grow. 
	- ==OMP + phospholipase mediate entry into the endothelial cells of microvessels at site of bite/scratch - > **cause endothelial injury , vascular perm, loss of fluids = shock!**==
	- CDC - tick bite bot = helps you remove them + helps you decide where to find care - helpful resource! 
- ==body louse + flea + hard tick  = transmitters== 
1. ==Rickettsiae rickettsii – rocky mountain spotted fever, hard tick bite== 
	- infected (hard body) tick bite 
	- more common ==<19 yrs, in summertime, more east== 
	- ==non-specific flu-like symptoms can progress to life threatening, **one of only a few that causes a rash on palms+soles**==

	- ==latent+relapsing infection = **brill zinsser dz**==
	- ==TREAT: tetracycline== 
3. ==Rickettsiae typhi – murine endemic typhus== 
	- **endemic typhus** - rat flea, cat flea, mouse ==flea bite!!!==. ==reservoir opossums, dogs, cats + fleas== get infected when they bite those **reservoir animals**

==zoonotic viral infections transmitted by animal bites/body fluids==
1. ==Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) –== 
	- ==reservoir host - like a fruit bat== natural host pre-outbreak, then they get the ==fruits, get to the small mammal population, and then humans eat them.==
		- ==human to human spread = physical contact or droplets== 
	- much can be contained by training ppl to recognize symptoms and isolate ppl early 
	- ==enveloped, filamentous, helical -ssRNA== 
	- ==60% mortality rate from hemorrhagic fever + shock== 
	- ==TREAT: single dose ebola virus vaccine, monoclonal abx against spike protein== 
	1. ebola - 
	2. marburg - 
2. ==Hantavirus -== 
	- in the us, ==-ssRNA==
	- ==rodent reservoir + transmission thru inhaling rodent exreta== 
	- ==old world species = hemorrhagic fever== v. ==new world = hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the us = high mortality== 
		- =="sin nombre virus" in the four corners region== 
		- we got ==black creek hantavirus with the mice in SC==  
		- ==hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - **non specific flu like symptomes then 4-10 days later SOB + resp failure. only supportive care available**==
			- no human to human transmission reported. 
	- ==prevention - mask+gloves , ventilation be4 and during work, avoid aerosols, use water + disinfectants.==
