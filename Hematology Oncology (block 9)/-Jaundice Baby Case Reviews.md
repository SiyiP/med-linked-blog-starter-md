*practice more ABO and agglutination test matching and interpreting*
O- mom + dad 
results of agglutination test - 
- agglutinating to A,B, and Rh+, with it reacting with anti-D antigen = spotty appearance is agglutination 

the reverse type shows it too, except for anti d - 
- A and B = confirmation to it 
- and D and all other ones don't come with isoagglutinates. 

erview about coombs direct antiglobulin test 
- IgG + anti-IgG can agglutinate RBC... adding the coombs will bind to the Fc already attached to red cells and now you see it 
note - IgG alone can't cause agglutination - but igM alone can agglutinate - no need for coombs reagent. coombs is a helper 

IgG human myeloma protein -> immunize rabbit, then get antiserum from rabbit , and then it reacts with the IgG myelmoa protein 
- specific part of IgG myeloma protein from the antiserum reacts with - 
- it's an anti-idiotypic antibody **reacts w variable portion of gamma/delta chains**

"warm" autoimmune hemolytic anemia - IgG 
- extravascular destruction mediated by phagocytes
- bites taken outta it , schistocytes 
"cold" = think IGM 
- intravascular mediated by complement lysis 
- obliterated, ? 

Debbie the baby = jaundice worse after birth - more hemolysis
- **why did she get sicker afterwards?** - mom has lost 3 newborns be4... so we have to guess that maybe those 3 are lost due to hemolytic dz of fetus/newborn - 
	- they were anemic , edematous (extramedullary hematopoiesis), hepatomegaly, so much of liver's occupied making the red cells, **albumin levels, which are usually made by liver go DOWN**- > why babies get edematous; HYDROPIC BABIES!!
	- debbie - very edematous at birth... but get more and more jaundice 
		- be4 birth, all that bilirubin in utero was taken care of by the mom's liver!!! baby in utero not jaundiced, just severely anemic 
		- in severe cases , the baby can be given Rh- blood in utero , make sure you irradiate it bc babies are immunocompromised. GvHD kills .... maybe exchange transfusions at birth (don't memorize criteria tbh)
		- in less severe cases = place UV light bc helps breakdown unconjugated bilirubin 
		- **that's why after birth, when she couldn't conjugate and get rid of it -> worse jaundice!**
- hematocrit 28% (regular is 40 and stuff, newborns higher)
- direct bilirubin conjugated in normal ranges .1 mg/dL (happens in liver glucorondyl transferase)
- total - 10 mg/dL , huge , mostly unconjugated meaning **hb being broken down + released but no conjugation, issues with the liver!**
- a lot of nucleated RBCs - shows that baby is very anemic + bone marrow trying to compensate ): - characteristic with hemolytic dz of fetus + newborn 
- also - polychromasia - darkness due to residual RNA in RBCs - these are **reticulocytes!!!** - characteristic with hemolytic dz of fetus + newborn 
- we don't see that many schistocytes... but we see a lot of micropherocytes 
- 
ms jones = mom - has issues AFTER the first baby ; first baby was the one who sensitized her to the d antigen 
- can it be prevented? yeah if Rh- mom doesn't have anti-d yet. 
- Rh- moms, give RhO[D] immunoglobulin, Rhogam
- Rh immune globulin prevents development of anti-D in mom, if mom is Rh- .... inhibits giving her trouble for the rest of her pregnancies. 
	- both at 28th wk and immediately after delivery 
	- honestly all women, Rh+/- should get a screen!!! at 28 wks 
direct coombs causes - IDs antibodies on RBC that are alr there 
- hemolytic transfusion rxn 
- medications
- autoimmune hemolytic anemia 
- hemolytic dz of the newborn 
	- why's there not more of this from ABO incompatibility? - RECALL: that it's almost always super mild. note that ABO antigens are carbs, so IgM mostly don't cross. even if anti ABO IgG are made, those will bind in placenta before reaching baby! bc **abo ag are on all tissues**

indirect coombs - same deal but we add in the antibodies 
![[antibody blood screen.png]]
[[-MMT Transfusion Medicine Squires]] - look at slide 37 - complete antibody screening 
- all RBCs in the screening panel are Os. only looking for unexpected antibodies 
- note - we don't do reverse type (serum of newborn or patient) until after 4 months bc these anti-A/Bs are acquired!!!!
	- we did it in tis case bc mom's O.... and they have SO much IgG antibodies... **there's a change those anti-A/B can cross placenta, might give a reverse typing but it's the mom's blood not the baby's**
	- if they have other antibodies , it is IgM, not able to cross the placenta ... **anti-A and anti-B, shouldn't appear until 3-4 months of age**
	- diff in isoagglutination data at birth vs at 9 mon of age - baby will lack gut microbes at birht that mimic A + B blood antigens. 
		- **they are induced by gut microbes when gut flora are established after birth** 
note - direc tcoombs = don't rlly look into if you have no hemolytic anemia 
indirect coombs in asymptomatic parent = only when they have placenta going into the baby 

solid phase testing - not on exam, but there's other ways to do abo testing/screening
