![[5. Anticoagulants I and II_Blumer_NOTES (1).pdf]]

high yield + important drugs - 
AEs of bleeding for nearly all of them - serious considerations and monitoring 
platelet drugs, anticoagulants and then anti-fibrolitics 
- antiplatelets - COX inhibitors, P2y12 antag, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, cAMP PDE inhibitors
- anticoagulants - heparins, vita K antagonists, factor 10a inhibitors, factor 2a inhibitors
- thrombolytics 
- reversal agents - note that these can be used instead of these specific drugs = agent of circumstance. you can pick any pretty much 
- antifibolytic drugs 
abnormal coagulation - see venous thrombosis DVT - pretty common, basically venous valves are common - see turgidity/low flow , associated pathology of platelet+RBC coagulation , red thrombsis
arterial thrombosis - irregularities on endothelial lining - atherosclerotic plaques = foci for platelet aggregation = **white thrombis** = stroke + heart attack/MI = there's anti-platelets of preventive measures. extra risk in prosthetic heart valves precipitating clots. also a-fib, and knee/hip replacement surgeries. 

platelet phase - they adhere to subendothelial factors exposed by trauma .... including vWF and collagen. adhesion mediated by GPIa/IIa + GPIb
adhesion + activation => feed forward activation loop, more and more granules and ADP from platelets will cause more and more platelets to aggregate. any time you see P2y = think gpcrs that bind to ADPs, that can bind together. 
- p2y1 and p2y12 = purogenic receptors that ADP binds to => **stimulates GPIIb/IIIa receptors** = binds to fibrinogen, causes platelet adherence to each other in 2ndary plug + stimulates COX1 = releases thromboxane A2 TXA2 to aggregate platelets. 
- COX1 stimulation also happens with collagen interaction with its receptor 
- Ca2+ released from granules = cofactor for many proteases in coagulation cascade - linking platelet + coag phases to make poz feedback loop 
- PAR1/4 = protease activated receptors = GPCRs *activated by thrombin factor 2a* in cascade... like Ca2+ , provides link between platelet + coagulation phases, making a poz feedback loop! = > **permenantly activated!**
	- just focus on the drug targets
- PGI2 = prostaglandin made by endothelial cells' COX2 to inhibit platelet aggregation 

aspirin - ASA = MOA: **irreversible inhib of cox1 and cox2**
- major cox product in platelets is TXA2... inducer of platelet agg+vasoconstriction 
- by inhibiting this, we can't activate more platelets. min amount is 75 mg daily. lower dose bc irreversible covalent! common to use with **another antiplatelet therapy = dual antiplatelet therapy DAPT = like p2y12 adp receptors**
	- mainly after surgeries and stuff 
- prevention = stroke + MI in at risk pts, Acute coronary syndrome + ppl who get prosthetic heart pieces!
- AEs: GI upset bc of blocking PGI2 in gut, which usually helps balance out the histamine responses but can't anymore... might make an ulcer. also bleeding risk + REYE syndrome in 20 yrs and lower kids 

P2Y12 antag = xyz-grel 
- clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrel-or
- ADP meant to bind to p2y12.... will then couple to Gi, which lowers cAMP,
	- ==recall: cAMP **inhibits platelet activation**.... ADP binding p2y12 so lowering it could cause cAMP to go down, which activates the platelets more== 
- clopidogrel - irreversible inhibitor of p2y12 receptor - **prodrug requires activation via CYP 2c19 in the liver**
	- note prevalent polymorphisms in 2C19 gene in general population = some don't benefit from clopidogrel, resistance there, so they may be inadequately protected. 
	- to prevent rate of stroke, MI and death in pts with **a recent hx of these**
	- most often combo'd with asa after coronary stent in DAPT
	- AEs - inc bleeding risk, TTP = **thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal dysfunction which can be life-threatening but rare. helped with plasma.**
	- interactions - with PPIs, which are **CYP 2C19 inhibitors!**
- prasugrel - irreversible inhib, also a prodrug
	- **stronger more efficient + rapid action version of clopidogrel = but more bleeding risk!**
	- more for pts who are **undergoing stenting**... ACS, better drug but more bleeding. 
	- CI in ppl 75+ yo bc of that 
- ticagrelor - **reversible inhibitor of P2Y12**
	- reduction of risk in MI, stroke, ACS or hx of myocardial. 
	- more potent than clopidogrel, but this is more expensive bc it's on-patent. 
	- AEs; ***dyspnea* , CI in pts with prior intracranial bleeding**

GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors - recall that this is to **bind to fibrinogen to crosslink platelets together**
- eptifibatide - use of these inhibitors declined with more potent p2y12 inhibitors 
	- cyclic peptide inhibitor of fibrinogen binding site on GPIIb/IIIa
	- use as **iv infusion during percutaneous intervention/stenting**
	- AE bleeding and thrombocytopenia, no longer in use

cAMP PDE inhibitors
- dipyridamole, cilostazol
- recall: cAMP suppresses platelet activation, so by stopping the metabolisis of cAMP, we would inc the levels of cAMP!
- can also vasodilate via cAMP/PKA pathway , improving PAD etc 
- dipyridamole
	- inhibits cAMP PDE - only available with aspirin ; combined to **secondary prevention of ischemic stroke**
	- helps pad + claudication
	- AEs: headaches 
- cilostazol - inhibits PDE3 - a cAMP phosphodiesterase, causing **accumulation of cAMP** + vasodilation 
	- **CI in pts with heart failure!!!**
	- non-inferior to asa to 2ndary prevent ischemic stroke + pad + claudication 
	- AEs: headaches too! 

coagulation phase
- recall intrinsic system - contact exposure of vessels
- extrinsic - tissue factor pathway , more dmg to tissue -> usually DIC 

natural anticoagulation mechs -
- PGI2 = made by cox-2 in endothelial cells + inhibits platelet aggregation. in opposition to activity of cox-1 (makes TXA2), **so with some cox-2 inhibitors we might see inc risk of stroke**
- AT-III - anti-thrombin III, a protease inhibitor of many coagulation factors (thrombin + factor 10)
	- ==heparan sulfate proteoglycans presented at healthy vasc endothelial cells enhance binding of AT-III to coagulation factors = this is the MOA of heparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux== 
- protein C/S 
	- protein C converted into active protein C protease, APC by thrombin/thrombomodulin complex. 
	- this will then go with protein s as cofactor + degrade clotting factors 5a and 8a
	- protein C production inhibited by warfarin => warfarin induced skin necrosis.... 

anticoagulants - heparin 
- GAG, binds to anti-thrombin III, enhancing the afinity for clotting factors, which terminates the clotting factors. 
- use: managing presentation with DVT, angina, MI, PCI, surgery of bypass.
	- helping prevent thrombosis with coronary balloon angiopathy + bypass (bc circuits of bypass can activate factor 7)
- "unfractionated heparin = UFH" - form that is very rapid - **in the acute hospital setting to treat DVT + pulm embolism**
	- also good for pregnancy bc doesn't cross placenta like warfarin 
- immediate onset of action when IV 
- ==**must monitor this with PTT - target is 1.5-2.5x of baseline ptt**==
- AEs: major bleeding + **REVERSE WITH PROTAMINE SULFATE - binds tightly with heparin + neutralizes it**
	- serious effect - heparin-induced thrombocytopenia HIT = **antibodies against heparin in complex with PF4 = released from a-granules during platelet aggregation, then we will activate and bind more platelets -> thrombosis + splenic macrophage removal. we get clots**
		- typically 5-10s post heparin administration. venous thromboembolism most common but arterial thrombosis also happens(MIs, limb ischemia, stroke etc). life-threatening 
		- [[-SFP Bleeding Disorders I-IV Overview, 1 and 2dary hemostasis_Squires]]
		- women more likely to get it, and surgical pts more commonly 
		- **make sure you stop heparin + IV direct thrombin inhibitor like argatroban!!!**
	- also osteoporosis bc inc activity of osteoclasts
	- also type 4 RTA- **heparin inhibits aldosterone synthesis - causing hyperkalemia**- which will inhibit ammoniagenesis by kidneys 
- low molecular weight heparin - LMWH = enoxaparin - smaller ones, antigoagulant effect
	- more selective for factor Xa/10a inhibition than 2a/thrombin inhibition
	- tends to have better bioavailability + subq administration self-administer! 
	- no routine lab monitoring bc predictable and platelet factor 4 less interaction so HIT is less common 
	- longer half-life, exclusively cleared by kidneys so CI in ppl with renal insufficiency 
	- **this is a bridge to oral anticoagulant like warfarin bc it takes several days to achieve the therapeutic INR**. 
	- NOT reversible by protamine sulfate 
- fondaparinux - smaller one - only has **factor Xa activity** !!!!!
	- used for pt going thru hip + knee surg/hip fracture in pts with DVT/PEs. not for stenting or **any big cardio surgeries**

vitamin K antag = warfarins = **coags II, VII, IX, and X and proteins C+S**
- these are all made in the liver + biologically inactive unelss amino terminal glu residues are y-carboxylated!!! using reduced vitamin k 
- these all promote binding to vascular endothelium at sites of dmg 
- warfarin will target the **vitamin K oxide reductase** which usually replenishes the reduced vitamin K ... so no more. 
	- no effect on the activity of already fully y-carboxylated factors already in **circulation so these must be cleared first!** 
	- bc of long half life of factor II, thrombin, not achieved effect for 4-5 days. using heparins. 
- use: prevent DVT/PE following treatment with heparins + prevent a-fibs, heart valves, ventricular assist devices. 
- higher variability in response to interactions. 
	- food-drug - inc of vitamin k from diet decreases efficacy!! 
	- disruption of intestinal flora bc they will naturally make vitamin k as a byproduct. **basically antibiotics can reduce amt of vitamin k, resulting in inc. in warfarin efficacy!** = more risk of bleeds
	- CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms can decrease warfarin clearance, so pts with loss of function are more sensitive to it, more in risk of bleeds. opposite true of some ppl with **vitamin K oxide reductase** polymorphisms - warfarin resistance 
- we need to monitor the levels well bc of these ^^
- AEs: bleeeds we can use plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate for rapid reversal but vitamin K if non-emergent situation 
	- **warfarin induced skin necrosis** - within first few days of initial warfarin dose/dose escalations
		- protein C = highest turnover of factors, so these will be reduced very rapidly, causing more clots bc APC + protein S come together to degrade 5a and 8a.... **small vessel microhtrombosis in skin**
	- DO NOT use in pregnant pts!
- warfarin monitoring - PT is used - measure of extrinsic pathway!! clotting time we take in account the INR = (pt patient / pt reference)^ISI
- ISI - international sensitivity index = measure of activity assigned to tissue factor 
	- note = target is 2-3 INr, if more , means bleeding risk, and if too little, it's a clotting risk 

direct acting oral anticoagulants - DOACs
Factor 10a inhibitors = ApiXAban
- all have Xa in the name, as in Xa inhibitors! 
- don't req lab monitoring, but more expensive
- DVT/PE treatment + prophalaxis, stroke prophalaxis in **non-valvular afib patients**
- CI in stroke prevention for pts with mechanical heart valves/valvular afib = use warfarin instead
- avoid in pts with anti-phospholipid syndrome bc warfarins are better 
- AE: bleeding is lower , 
- reverse agent s= ANDEXANET ALFA = homogenous form of factor Xa that doesn't have proteolytic activity , a **decoy for Xa inhibitors! titrates away too much DOACs**
	- only for major life threatening hemorrhage
	- but for major bleeding think - prothrombin complex concentrate + TXA/EACA - more likely irl 

DOACs: Dabigatran - **direct thrombin inhibitors**
- not as common bc these have higher bleeding risk 
- orally avaliable , for acute VTE after heparin, secondary stroke prevention in pts with nonvalvular afib, post-op thromboprophylaxis post knee/hip surgery 
	- REVERSAL agent - idarucizumab - monoclonal antibody fragment directed against this, will bind to dabigratran for serious bleeds. 
- AEs: major bleeds + avoid in renal impairment bc cleared by kidneys 

DTIs. - 
- argatroban - **preferred for HIT with acute thrombosis - this is rapid onset action from being IV**
- MOA + uses identical to dabigatran - for acute VTE after heparin, secondary stroke prevention in pts with nonvalvular afib, post-op thromboprophylaxis 
- **very short halflife** + **safe to use in pts with renal impairment.** 

thrombolytic drugs = clotbusters - dissolution of clot reduces TISSUE injury, ischemia, etc. 
initiate/accelerate breakdown of fibrin 
fibrinolysis - tPA tissue plasminogen activator secreted by endothelial cells, which binds fibrin + cleaves plasminogen to plasmin 
	- the activity bc it binds fibrin is restricted to clot bound plasminogen!!!
	- plasmin = digest fibrin 
	- plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2 PAI-1,PAI-2 inactivates tPA 
	- a2-antiplasmin 2-AP also inactivates plasmin 
- Alteplase = recombinant human tPA!!!!
	- MOA: converts plasminogen to plasmin 
	- for coronary thrombosis, PE, **ischemic stroke!!!!**
	- only for ischemic and not hemorrhagic! they have recovery only if infused in 3-5 hrs of stroke, you're on a timer! 
- AE: bleeding - slightly lower, but angioedema 
	- antidote - antifibrolytic drugs like EACA, TXA FFP, PCC 

antifibrinolytic drugs! - these help promote clotting
- Tranexamic acid - TXA = reversibly blocks lysine binding sites on **plasminogen, preventing fibrin degradation**
	- prevent tPA from dissolving clots with binding plasminogen 
	- use - hemorrhage, with the antidote, uterine bleeding , hip or knee arthroplasty to reduce blood loss (**pre/during op, not post-op like anticoagulants**)
	- AEs: hypersensitivity, visual disturbances, seizures, risk of thrombosis 
- EACA - epsilon-aminocaproic acid - moa - binds competitively to plasminogen, blocking binding of plasminogen to fibrin + conversion to plasmin too 
	- uses - hemorrhage + antidote as well - not something separate from TXA.
