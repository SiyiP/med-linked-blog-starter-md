![[6. Anti-Malarial Drugs and Therapies for Other Blood-Borne Parasites_Blumer_NOTES.pdf]]

malaria infections - are very common worldwide - important to learn - we need to be informed. 
be aware of both disease presentation and degrees of complicated v uncomplicated malaria 

antimalarial agents
quinolines - same mechanisms, a bit different with primaquine 
artemesinins - arte- all similar with these
lumefantrine/atovaquone - all combined commonly with artemesinins
antibiotics - species that carry vestigial organelles that we can target with these
antifolate drugs - plasmodium version of the reductase 

some locally acquired malaria - most likely vivax. 
anti-malarial drugs - categorized based on activities during the plasmodium life cycle as well as their use for either prophalaxis or treatment of active disease! 
- drugs targetting asexual blood stages = to prevent/treat active dz 
- drugs targetting asexual erythrocytic forms of parasite and also liver stages  - atovaquones/proguanils 
- drugs that target primary + latent liver stages hypnozoites of vivax + ovale = primaquines 
note - primoaquine - the only drug that can rid the latent liver stages of vivax+ovale bc they can just stay and make it recur over time! 

anti-malarial drugs = learn it via moa !!!!
- blocking conversion of free heme to hemozoin - chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine, lumefantrine 
- disrupt e-transport = atovaquone + prob primaquine
- production of free radicals = artemisinin, artesunate, artemether
- inhibition of folate synthesis - proguanil 
- inhibit protein synthesis in apicoplast (vestigial plastid, like chloroplast non-photosynthetic) - doxycycline, clindamycin 

quinolines - quinine - from bark, malarial parasites
- they digest hemoglobin as a food source
- this process makes free heme = **highly reactive + toxic to the parasite, 
- malaria sequesters free heme into insoluble, chemically inert compound known as hemozoin
	- basically you have a bunch of free heme now that it's not getting converted to hemozoin which makes it burst + kill the bug of the food vacuole 
chloroquine - historically very effective - but reserved for pts who contract it in places where it's not resistant. - north of panama canal, middle east etc. 
- global use declined bc of resistance! 
- also used for prophalaxis, not first line 
- PfCRT gene that will **be basis for resistance, by pumping out the drug in p. falciparum**
- chloroquine + primaquine combo = for p vivax + ovale 
- AE - GI , **visual disturbances, deafness/ear stuff, widened QRS , QT prolonging, headaches;; seizure risk + hemolysis in pts with G6pd def**
	- good for pregnancy 
quinine - still used today - for uncomplicated p. falciparum 
- 2nd line bc of AEs. 
- short halflifes, 
- AEs: **cinchonism - n/v/dysphoria, tinnitus, HIGHtone deafness, visual disturbances**
	- **hypoglycemia, hypotension**
	- more arrhythmias, allergic rxns - TTP!!!!! blackwater fever 
mefloquine - 
- not first line 
- **primarily used for prophalaxis bc long half life of 13-24 days**
	- **AE - neuro symptoms, some vivid dreams, dizziness, psychosis/seizures!!!!!**
primaquine- moa unclear - oxidative dmg ; high activity against latent tissue forms or hypozoites of vivax/ovale 
- DOC: treating hypnozoite stages
- **note - hemolytic anemia in g6pd deficiency , rule out g6pd def bc of the dangers with ros damage.**
- **avoid in pregnancy**

ARTEMESININS - greatest efficacy + tolerability 
- potent + fast acting anti-malarials 
- MOA - metabolized in food vacuole of parasite to make toxic free radicals!!!- 
	- heme iron made cleaves peroxide bridge in artemesinin structure! 
- DOC - **severe malaria - we use these for all falciparum infections**
- active against chloroquine resistant p. vivax. 
- due to **short halflife, requires longer acting partner drug like doxy, lumefantrine , etc**
	- artemesinin based combination therapy - ACT
	- ACT partners chosen for potency + halflife that exceeds
	- **ARTEMETHER + lumefantrine = malaria therapy common**
	- **ARTEMESININ + doxy = severe malaria treatment**
- relatively safe for pregnancies but avoid 1st trimester

lumefantrine - used in combo with ACT therapy - oral 
- highly effective in treating **noncomplicated malaria**
- basically interferes with heme polymerization in acid food vacuole 
- high half life 4-5 days, administration with high fat meal 
- AEs: n/v diarrhea + rash 

proguanil - inhibitor of dihydropfolate reductase DHFR of the plasmodium ...
- activity against primary liver stages + asexual blood stages of falciparum + vivax 
- doesn't kill gametocytes but can block normal dev of oocytes in the mosquito gut 
- most commonly **combined w atovaquone!** = bc resistance can occur fast but this stops it from getting resistance 

atovaquone - lipophilic analog of coenz q/ubiquinone. so inhibition of e-transport chain, 
- active against the **erythrocytic and tissue trophozoites/shizonts of all plasmodium species**
- always given with proguanil = DOC for **malaria prophylaxis + uncomplicated malaria**
- SEs: mild, n/v etc. 

antimicrobials - target ribosomes of apicoplast of malarial parasite to stop protein translation - this is a similar to mitochrondrial inhibitor 
- vestigial organelle from endosymbiosis, essential to life for the bug. 
- doxycycline - added with artesynate = **for severe malaria**
	- SE: skin photosensitivity, n/v, CI in both **children <8 and pregnancy!!! **
- keepin mind some tings
	- first line treatments for uncomplicated malarias - p. falciparum 
	- artemether + lumefantrine = !!!! most first line 
	- atovaquone + proguanil = commonly used for both uncomplicated + some prophylaxis. 

p. vivax + ovale - chloroquine + primaquine = basically chloroquine as initial therapy, then prophylaxis of doses thruout, and then primaquine post-partum to rid those from the liver. 

p. malariae/knowlesi - sensitive to chloroquine 

severe malaria - **almost always falciparum!!!**
- hyperparasitemia, 3-5+% rbcs infected, cerebral malaria with coma, anemia, renal failure, resp failure, impaired conciousness, prostration, convulsions, acidosis, jaundice, pulm edema, shock - really sick pt
- DOC: **IV artemesinin + doxycycline** immediately 
- monitor for parasitemia 

prophylaxis - before traveller leaves home 
- typically chloroquine in places without resistant p. falciparum
- **atovaquone + proguanil in US preferred**
- mefloquine 
- doxycycline 
- primauqine - single agent for all types of malaria for in places where p. vivax/ovale are endemic

leishmaniasis - 
- sodium stibogluconate - can be cutaneous or visceral form
	- the fly can cause cutaneous leishmaniasis which is disfiguring, and then we can inject this into the lesions - first choice for cutaneous, 2nd for visceral leishmaniasis 
	- MOA: prodrug gets reduced to toxic Sb3+ species that kill amastigotes in the phagolysosomes, interfering with redox + loss of glutathione in the parasite 
	- SE: panceratitis, LFTs up, bone marrow suppressin, long qt 
- typanosoma / chagas dz of kissing bug = T. cruzi 
	- MOA - both chemically reduced, making nitroradical anions. = cellular dmg! 
	- benznidazole - first line due to inc efficaycy + safety compared to nifurtimox!!!
	- nifurtimox - SEs: n/v, myalgia, weakness , bone marrow suppression, peripheral neuropathy + gi 
	- benznidazole - better tolerated, we might see urticarial dermatitis hives in 30%, manage with antihistamines/steroids, bone marrow suppression, and peripheral neuropathy etc.

blood born helminths
albendazoles - broad spec oral anti-helminthic agent
- moa - inhibit microtubule polymerization by binding b-tubulin and blocking division! ]
- use against - nematodes - **loa loa, pinworm, whipworm, etc**
- AEs: good safety - avoid 1st trimester, LFTs+bone marrow in long term but that's rare 

ivermectin - tonic paralysis of nematode muscles - like a gaba a receptor! - hyperpolarizes nematode nerves by activating cl- channel! - 
- activity against onchoceriasis = river blindness - 
- AEs: well tolerated, most SEs are due to host immune rxns 

diethylcarbamanzine - DEC - unknown MOA
- DOC for lymphatic filariasis, brugia malayi, wuchereria bancrofti- very disfiguring dz of lymphatic systems
- DOC for loa loa too 
- very well tolerated.
