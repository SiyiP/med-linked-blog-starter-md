therapeutic ratio - how many cancer cells are you killing vs normal cells? 
gene therapies - CAR-T therapies make an impact. = using host immune system against cancers 
- gene therapy is hard: complexity depends on gene plasticity, rarely monogenic event leads to cancer! 
- very invasive, time-consuming, etc.

common terms of chemo
   Debulking: surgical removal of large tumors prior to drug treatment. 
• Neoadjuvant therapy: treatments given before surgery to shrink primary tumor. if it's infiltrating tissues or hard to do therapy we wanna shrink it. 
• Maintenance therapy: low dose therapies to prolong remission. 
• Growth fraction: proportion of cells in cell cycle (usually more susceptible). dividing cells vs latent ones 
• Log cell kill: e.g. in a leukemic patient with 109 cells, a 4 log kill leaves 105. This induces remission but will require additional therapies for cure. **number of logs killed with chemo.** 
• Treatment induced tumors: secondary latent neoplasms sometimes caused by drug-induced mutations. 
• Pharmacologic sanctuaries: tumor cells may enter the CNS where drug access is limited. - **areas where cells can hide like the CNS** 
• Treatment protocols: drug combination therapies – frequently given acronyms. 
**• Intermittent therapy: drugs administered at intervals to allow recovery of patient’s normal tissues.** 
• Multidrug resistance: patient non-response through drug resistance. big issue in cancer drugs - tumor cells will evolve darwinian, only a few can develop it and then populate the tumor 
Minimizing adverse effects: toxicities that may be ameliorated by interventions usually cotreatment with drugs 
• T cell exhaustion: arises during chronic infections and cancer, defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors. **poor t cell effector function**
• PD-1: protein on T cells that keeps immune responses in check. When PD-1 is bound to PD-L1, it keeps T cells from killing cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can block PD-1.  huge in t cell activation, if you mess around with it, **you can activate t cells to attack cancers**
	FYI: to stop the pain of the toxicities, you have to modulate the dose, unless there's something specific you can add to it

target nucleic acid pathways 
- antimetabolites - synthesis and incorporation of many drugs into dna - they mimic them and stop production 
- alkylating agents +  antibiotics = these **bind directly** to DNA instead of interfering with the precursors. 
	-**stop it from unwinding or going thru replication / division again**
cell cycle specific drugs = 
- antimetabolites
- bleomycin peptide antibiotics
- vinca alkaloids
- etoposide  
cell cycle non-specific drugs = these all impact things outside of the cell cycle, nonspecific. 
- alkylating agents
- antibiotics = which bind to the DNA.

7 classes of agents - ROYGBIV... recall **- MOA + dose limiting toxicities** 
1. antimetabolites - mimic nucleotides + bases , interfere with synthesis - vast majority can also be great viral agents bc they work well on reducing the nucleic acid supply - most normal ESSENTIAL TOX: n/v, diarrhea, myelosuppression 
	- *pyrimidine analog*
		1. **5-fluorouracil** = colon , breast, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, skin treatment topically 
			- basically, 5-FU is given then turned into 5-fDUMP, w/ phosphoriboxyl transferase, uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase.  
			- 5-fdUMP trapped with **thymidylate synthesase, reducing the amount of thymine** w/ N5,N10 methyl tetrahyrofolate + thymidylate synthase in tert complex. 
				- CELL dies from **NO THYMINE!!! = base imbalance and interference**
			- ESSENTIAL toxicities - ulcers in oral mucosa 
		2. capecitabine - *converted* into 5-FU as a prodrug orally. 
		3. floxuridine = GI tumor metastasis to liver? 
			- ESSENTIAL toxicities - enteritis/stomatitis local erythema 
	- *purine analogs*
		1. **6-mercaptopurines** = leukemias
			- purine structure except with an SH group
			- acted upon by the **hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase** -> making the 6-thioinosinic acid, which inhibits any IMP to AMP/XMP (nucleotide formation), phosphoribosylamine synthesis (purine synthesis) 
				- inhibits nucleotide formation 
				- inhibits purine synthesis 
				- 6-thioinosinic acid incorporates INTO DNA/RNA 
			- hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase can have differences between ppl and those genetic differences impact how well the drug works 
				- >[!drug interactions] 6-mercaptopurine + allopurinol: xanthine oxidase is inhibited by allopurinol but the liver's xanthine oxidase first pass converts 6-MP -> thiouric acid. 
			- TOXICITIES: liver
		2. 6-thioguanines = leukemias
			- TOXICITIES: liver
		3. cladribine = leukemias+lymphomas 
			- TOXICITIES: neuropathy 
			- inhibits adenosine deaminase 
	- *Deoxycytidine analogues*
		1. **gemcitabine** = pancreas+lung - 
			- fluorine groups in it, gets processed y deoxycytidine kinase -> mimic of **cytidine**, so dCTP down! 
			- TOXICITIES: flu symptoms 
		2. cytosine arabinoside/cytarabine. = leukemias 
			- TOX: common 
	- folic Acid analogue: 
		1. **Methotrexate** = leukemias/lymphomas
			- targets **dihydrofolate reductase**, reducing the amount of **thymidine** available, stops the production of N5N10-methylene-FH4. 
				- stuck at folate bc doesn't make FH2, and stuck at FH2 bc doesn't make FH4
			- "Rescue” compound: Leucovorin  - administration of precursor base N5-formyl-FH4, converted to **N5N10-methylene-FH4** - **rescue bc taken up preferentially by normal cells**
			- TOXICITIES: stomatitis, alopecia, rash 

2. Antitumor antibiotics  - causes DNA dmg , and cells can repair it or not, many come from natural products. **all given IV, non cross BBB**. ESSENTIAL TOX: dmg associated with free radicals
	1. bleomycin = testicular cancers, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphomas
		- makes an iron complex that causes strand breaks via free radicals
		- single strand breaks can be repaired, but this causes double strand breaks 
		- TOX: **pulm fibrosis** via iron fenton rxn; hydroxyl radicals 
	2. dactinomycin = sarcomas (kids) - binds **DNA!**

3. Alkylating agents  - bind covalently to DNA, messing up bases ; adducting to the DNA itself, adding to the helix structure, causing steric issues + issues with the 3d structure 	- always given IV, always crosses BBB
	- these all have chlorines on them, which will attach to ethyl groups, making carbonium ions -> nitrogen mustards. **these chlorines are leaving groups, which will leave a + charge (carbonium ions)**. VERY reactive to nucleophiles + bases etc. 
	- **bifunctionality** - when we have 2 chlorine groups, we can have 2nd reactive site, ***crosslinking*** 2 bases together = more toxic!
		- the toxicity is reduced by a repair factor which effeciently removes the chloroethyl monoadduct 
	- ALL TOX: myelosuppression, immune suppression, alopecia, mutagenic/carcinogenic, teratogenic, n/v + diarrhea... super toxic in general, think about how development of another cancer can occur, etc.

		- TOX: htn, stomatitis, diarrhea, perforated bowel/bleeding dz 
	2. cetuximab = EGF interferes with growth signaling, colorectal

		- TOX: immune issues 

6. Kinase inhibitors - target kinases **inside** cells which regulate pathways. ends in "-nib", all given orally. also **in terms of tox, not that srs, acne is used more as a marker to see if its working** 
	1. gefitinib = lung, non-small cell lung carcinomas
		- inhibits BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, making it more manageable!

7. Miscellaneous - like 8-9 of those. most poorly cross the BBB 
- PLATINUM DRUGS: "-platin"; given IV , kidney metabolism
	- similar to **alkylating agents** - they got **chlorine groups** that act as leaving, which then makes adducts/crosslinks.

- PROTEASOME INHIBITORS: interference with breakdown of drugs, proteins, etc 
	- when protein's not made properly, cell recognizes it based on hydrophobicity surfaces.... proteosome meant to break this down (critical bc we recycle these AAs)
	- "makes the tumor cell less efficient, bogged down by bad proteins"
	1. bortezomib = multiple myeloma 
- VARIOUS MECHANISMS
	1. asparaginase = childhood leukemia 
		- breaks down amino acid "**asparatate**", which fucks up the tumor cells 
		- normal cells have a lot of **asparagine synthetase, tumor cells dont have!!!**; thats why therapeutic index is good

	2. thalidomide = multiple myeloma 
	3. filgrastim = CSF transplant 
	4. procarbazine = hodgkins ; given orval or IV, kidney metabolism
