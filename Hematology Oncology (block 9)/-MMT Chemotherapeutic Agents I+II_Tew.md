therapeutic ratio - how many cancer cells are you killing vs normal cells? 
gene therapies - CAR-T therapies make an impact. = using host immune system against cancers 
- gene therapy is hard: complexity depends on gene plasticity, rarely monogenic event leads to cancer! 
- very invasive, time-consuming, etc.

common terms of chemo
   ==Debulking: surgical removal of large tumors prior to drug treatment.== 
• ==Neoadjuvant== therapy: treatments given ==before surgery to shrink primary tumor==. if it's infiltrating tissues or hard to do therapy we wanna shrink it. 
• Maintenance therapy: low dose therapies to prolong remission. 
• Growth fraction: proportion of cells in cell cycle (usually more susceptible). ==dividing cells vs latent ones== 
• Log cell kill: e.g. in a leukemic patient with 109 cells, a 4 log kill leaves 105. This induces remission but will require additional therapies for cure. **number of logs killed with chemo.** 
• Treatment induced tumors: secondary latent neoplasms sometimes caused by drug-induced mutations. 
• ==Pharmacologic sanctuaries: tumor cells may enter the CNS where drug access is limited. - **areas where cells can hide like the CNS**== 
• Treatment protocols: drug combination therapies – frequently given acronyms. 
==**• Intermittent therapy: drugs administered at intervals to allow *recovery* of patient’s *normal* tissues.**== 
• Multidrug resistance: patient non-response through drug resistance. big issue in cancer drugs - tumor cells will evolve darwinian, only a few can develop it and then populate the tumor 
Minimizing adverse effects: toxicities that may be ameliorated by interventions usually cotreatment with drugs 
==• T cell exhaustion: arises during chronic infections and cancer, defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors. **poor t cell effector function**==
==• PD-1: protein on T cells that keeps immune responses in check. When PD-1 is bound to PD-L1, it keeps T cells from killing cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can block PD-1.  huge in t cell activation, if you mess around with it, **you can activate t cells to attack cancers**==
	FYI: to stop the pain of the toxicities, you have to modulate the dose, unless there's something specific you can add to it

target nucleic acid pathways 
- antimetabolites - synthesis and incorporation of many drugs into dna - they mimic them and stop production 
- alkylating agents +  antibiotics = these **bind directly** to DNA instead of interfering with the precursors. ==**highest 2ndary malignancy risk**==
	-**stop it from unwinding or going thru replication / division again**
cell cycle specific drugs = 
- antimetabolites
- bleomycin peptide antibiotics
- vinca alkaloids
- etoposide  
cell cycle non-specific drugs = these all impact things outside of the cell cycle, nonspecific. 
- alkylating agents
- antibiotics = which bind to the DNA.

7 classes of agents - ROYGBIV... recall **- MOA + dose limiting toxicities** 
1. antimetabolites - mimic nucleotides + bases , interfere with synthesis - vast majority can also be great viral agents bc they work well on reducing the nucleic acid supply - most normal ESSENTIAL TOX: n/v, diarrhea, myelosuppression 
	- *pyrimidine analog*
		1. **5-fluorouracil** = colon , breast, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, skin treatment topically 
			- basically, 5-FU is given then turned into 5-fDUMP, w/ phosphoriboxyl transferase, uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase.  
			- 5-fdUMP trapped with **thymidylate synthesase, reducing the amount of thymine** w/ N5,N10 methyl tetrahyrofolate + thymidylate synthase in tert complex. 
				- CELL dies from **NO THYMINE!!! = base imbalance and interference**
				- **l==eucovorin can be paired with 5-FU to ENHANCE the inhibition of thymidylate synthase!== - it makes 5-FU bind better to thymidylate synthase much better, making a tighter complex + inhibiting the synthase better.**
					- ==leucovorin = precursor base N5-formyl-FH4 - inc the effects of 5-FU !!! **make N5,N10-CH2THF, recall it's the rescue effect**== 
					- compare this with using it as a rescue for methotrexate 
			- ESSENTIAL toxicities - ulcers in oral mucosa 
		2. capecitabine - *converted* into 5-FU as a prodrug orally. 
		3. floxuridine = GI tumor metastasis to liver? 
			- ESSENTIAL toxicities - enteritis/stomatitis local erythema 
	- *purine analogs*
		1. **6-mercaptopurines** = leukemias
			- purine structure except with an SH group
			- acted upon by the **hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase** -> making the 6-thioinosinic acid, which inhibits any IMP to AMP/XMP (nucleotide formation), phosphoribosylamine synthesis (purine synthesis) 
				- inhibits nucleotide formation 
				- inhibits purine synthesis 
				- 6-thioinosinic acid incorporates INTO DNA/RNA 
			- hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase can have differences between ppl and those genetic differences impact how well the drug works 
				- >[!drug interactions] 6-mercaptopurine + allopurinol: xanthine oxidase is inhibited by allopurinol but the liver's xanthine oxidase first pass converts 6-MP -> thiouric acid. 
			- >[!genetic testing]**thiopurine 5-methyltransferase** - know that there are many polymorphisms in this!!!! so we need to check for mutations in this 
			- TOXICITIES: liver
		2. 6-thioguanines = leukemias
			- TOXICITIES: liver
		3. cladribine = leukemias+lymphomas , specifically hairy cell leukemia 
			- TOXICITIES: neuropathy 
			- inhibits adenosine deaminase 
	- *Deoxycytidine analogues*

			- fluorine groups in it, gets processed y deoxycytidine kinase -> mimic of **cytidine**, so dCTP down! 
			- TOXICITIES: flu symptoms 
		2. cytosine arabinoside/cytarabine. = leukemias 
			- TOX: common 
	- folic Acid analogue: 
		1. **Methotrexate** = leukemias/lymphomas
			- targets **dihydrofolate reductase**, reducing the amount of **thymidine** available, stops the production of N5N10-methylene-FH4. 
				- stuck at folate bc doesn't make FH2, and stuck at FH2 bc doesn't make FH4
			- "Rescue” compound: Leucovorin  - administration of precursor base N5-formyl-FH4, converted to **N5N10-methylene-FH4** - **rescue bc taken up preferentially by normal cells**
			- TOXICITIES: stomatitis, alopecia, rash

	- these all have chlorines on them, which will attach to ethyl groups, making carbonium ions -> nitrogen mustards. **these chlorines are leaving groups, which will leave a + charge (carbonium ions)**. VERY reactive to nucleophiles + bases etc. 
	- **bifunctionality** - when we have 2 chlorine groups, we can have 2nd reactive site, ***crosslinking*** 2 bases together = more toxic!
		- the toxicity is reduced by a repair factor which effeciently removes the chloroethyl monoadduct 
	- ALL TOX: myelosuppression, immune suppression, alopecia, mutagenic/carcinogenic, teratogenic, n/v + diarrhea... super toxic in general, think about how development of another cancer can occur, etc.

		- activate T cells to activate immune response! overcoming the "tiredness" of the T cells, re-activating them again 
		- TOX: immune issues 
		- >[!microsatellite]**microsatellite instability - multiple repeats of something = basically dna replication makes a ton of mistakes = this is microsatellites. instability means some of those are repeats in coding sequences or mutations = now new proteins that are made with some in the cell surface.** 
		- >you will get more NEOANTIGENS = **most common in colorectal cancer - you get numerous neoantigens, which can be recognized by the host immune system, like CYTOTOXIC T CELLS!!! TO AVOID THIS, CANCER CELLS WILL OVEREXPRESS PD-L1!!!!! SO YOU NEED TO GIVE PEMBROLIZUMAB**
![[surface anatomy.png]]

6. Kinase inhibitors - target kinases **inside** cells which regulate pathways. ends in "-nib", all given orally. also **in terms of tox, not that srs, acne is used more as a marker to see if its working** 
	1. gefitinib = lung, non-small cell lung carcinomas

7. Miscellaneous - like 8-9 of those. most poorly cross the BBB 
- PLATINUM DRUGS: "-platin"; given IV , kidney metabolism
	- similar to **alkylating agents** - they got **chlorine groups** that act as leaving, which then makes adducts/crosslinks. 
	1. Cisplatin/carboplatin = testicular, ovarian, bladder
		- TOX: nephrotox, **ototox**, some neurotox ; some skin rash

	- "makes the tumor cell less efficient, bogged down by bad proteins"
	1. bortezomib = multiple myeloma 
- VARIOUS MECHANISMS
	1. asparaginase = childhood leukemia
