common terms of chemo
Debulking: surgical removal of large tumors prior to drug treatment. 
• Neoadjuvant therapy: treatments given before surgery to shrink primary tumor. if it's infiltrating tissues or hard to do therapy we wanna shrink it. 
• Maintenance therapy: low dose therapies to prolong remission. 
• Growth fraction: proportion of cells in cell cycle (usually more susceptible). dividing cells vs latent ones 
• Log cell kill: e.g. in a leukemic patient with 109 cells, a 4 log kill leaves 105. This induces remission but will require additional therapies for cure. **number of logs killed with chemo.** 
• Treatment induced tumors: secondary latent neoplasms sometimes caused by drug-induced mutations. 
• Pharmacologic sanctuaries: tumor cells may enter the CNS where drug access is limited. - **areas where cells can hide like the CNS** 
• Treatment protocols: drug combination therapies – frequently given acronyms. 
**• Intermittent therapy: drugs administered at intervals to allow recovery of patient’s normal tissues.** 
• Multidrug resistance: patient non-response through drug resistance. big issue in cancer drugs - tumor cells will evolve darwinian, only a few can develop it and then populate the tumor 
Minimizing adverse effects: toxicities that may be ameliorated by interventions usually cotreatment with drugs 
• T cell exhaustion: arises during chronic infections and cancer, defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors. **poor t cell effector function**
• PD-1: protein on T cells that keeps immune responses in check. When PD-1 is bound to PD-L1, it keeps T cells from killing cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can block PD-1.  huge in t cell activation, if you mess around with it, **you can activate t cells to attack cancers**

target nucleic acid pathways 
- antimetabolites - synthesis and incorperation of many drugs into dna - they mimic them and stop production 
	- anti
- alkylating agents +  antibiotics = these **bind directly** to DNA instead of interfering with the precursors. 
	-**stop it from unwinding or going thru replication / division again**

cell cycle specific drugs = 
- antimetabolites
- bleomycin peptide antibiotics
- vinca alkaloids
- etoposide  

cell cycle non-specific drugs = these all impact things outside of the cell cycle, nonspecific. 
- alkylating agents
- antibiotics = which bind to the DNA. 

7 classes of agents - ROYGBIV... recall **- MOA + dose limiting toxicities** 
1. antimetabolites - mimic nucleotides + bases , interfere with synthesis - vast majority can also be great viral agents bc they work well on reducing the nucleic acid supply - most normal ESSENTIAL TOX: n/v, diarrhea, myelosuppression 
	- *pyrimidine analog*
		- **5-fluorouracil** = colon , breast, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, skin treatment topically 
			- basically, 5-FU is given then turned into 5-fDUMP, w/ phosphoriboxyl transferase, uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase.  
			- 5-fdUMP trapped with **thymidylate synthesase, reducing the amount of thymine** w/ N5,N10 methyl tetrahyrofolate + thymidylate synthase in tert complex. 
				- CELL dies from **NO THYMINE!!! = base imbalance and interference**
			- ESSENTIAL toxicities - ulcers in oral mucosa 
		- capecitabine - *converted* into 5-FU as a prodrug orally. 
		- floxuridine = GI tumor metastasis to liver? 
			- ESSENTIAL toxicities - enteritis/stomatitis local erythema 
	- *purine analogs*
		- **6-mercaptopurines** = leukemias
			- purine structure except with an SH group
			- acted upon by the **hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase** -> making the 6-thioinosinic acid, which inhibits any IMP to AMP/XMP (nucleotide formation), phosphoribosylamine synthesis (purine synthesis) 
				- inhibits nucleotide formation 
				- inhibits purine synthesis 
				- 6-thioinosinic acid incorporates INTO DNA/RNA 
			- hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase can have differences between ppl and those genetic differences impact how well the drug works 
				- >[!drug interactions] 6-mercaptopurine + allopurinol: xanthine oxidase is inhibited by allopurinol but the liver's xanthine oxidase first pass converts 6-MP -> thiouric acid. 
			- TOXICITIES: liver
		- 6-thioguanines = leukemias
			- TOXICITIES: liver
		- cladribine = leukemias+lymphomas 
			- TOXICITIES: neuropathy 
			- inhibits adenosine deaminase 
	- *Deoxycytidine analogues*
		- **gemcitabine** = pancreas+lung - 
			- fluorine groups in it, gets processed y deoxycytidine kinase -> mimic of **cytidine**, so dCTP down! 
			- TOXICITIES: flu symptoms 
		- cytosine arabinoside/cytarabine. = leukemias 
			- TOX: common 
	- folic Acid analogue: 
		- **Methotrexate** = leukemias/lymphomas
			- targets **dihydrofolate reductase**, reducing the amount of **thymidine** available, stops the production of N5N10-methylene-FH4. 
				- stuck at folate bc doesn't make FH2, and stuck at FH2 bc doesn't make FH4
			- "Rescue” compound: Leucovorin  - administration of precursor base N5-formyl-FH4, converted to **N5N10-methylene-FH4** - **rescue bc taken up preferentially by normal cells**
			- TOXICITIES: stomatitis, alopecia, rash 
2. Antitumor antibiotics  - causes DNA dmg , and cells can repair it or not, many come from natural products. **all given IV, non cross BBB**. ESSENTIAL TOX: dmg associated with free radicals
	1. bleomycin = testicular cancers, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphomas
		- makes an iron complex that causes strand breaks via free radicals
		- single strand breaks can be repaired, but this causes double strand breaks 
		- TOX: **pulm fibrosis** via iron fenton rxn; hydroxyl radicals 
	2. dactinomycin = sarcomas (kids)
		- TOX: immunosuppression/myelosuppression/GI
	- ANTHRACYCLINES:
		1. doxorubicin = sarcomas
			- TOX: cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression/GI
		2. daunorubicin = leukemias
			- TOX: cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression/GI, alopecia
3. Alkylating agents  - bind covalently to DNA, messing up bases ; adducting to the DNA itself, adding to the helix structure, causing steric issues + issues with the 3d structure 	- always given IV, always crosses BBB
	- these all have chlorines on them, which will attach to ethyl groups, making carbonium ions -> nitrogen mustards. **these chlorines are leaving groups, which will leave a + charge (carbonium ions)**. VERY reactive to nucleophiles + bases etc. 
	- **bifunctionality** - when we have 2 chlorine groups, we can have 2nd reactive site, ***crosslinking*** 2 bases together = more toxic!
		- the toxicity is reduced by a repair factor which effeciently removes the chloroethyl monoadduct 
	- NITROGEN MUSTARDS: TOX: myelosuppression, immune suppression, alopecia, mutagenic/carcinogenic, teratogenic, n/v + diarrhea 
		1. melphalan = chronic lymphocytic leukemia
			- tox: extravasation @ site 
		2. cyclophosphamide = lymphomas; breast
			- makes acrolein, causing bladder tox. 
				- this can be detoxified by **mercaptoethanesulfonate/MENSA**
			- TOX: bladder hemorrhagic cystitis, neurotox, veno-occlusive dz, siadh 
		3. ifosfamide = lymphomas; breast 
			- makes acrolein, causing bladder tox. 
				- this can be detoxified by **mercaptoethanesulfonate/MENSA**
			- TOX: bladder hemorrhagic cystitis, neurotox, veno-occlusive dz, siadh 
		4. busulfan = chronic myelogenous leukemias, bone marrow transplants 
			- TOX: pulm fibrosis 
	- NITROSOUREAS: very lipid soluble; but brain tumors are hard to treat ): 
		1. carmustine = brain + CNS
		2. lomustine = brain + CNS
	- IMIDAZOLE:
		1. dacarbazine = lymphomas (melanoma, sarcoma, pancreas); used sparingly 
	- TRIAZENE: brain tumors are hard to treat ): 
		1. temozolomide = brain + CNS 
4. Antimitotic agents  - interfere with mitosis - the way that chromosomes  lay out and divide 
5. Monoclonal antibodies- interfere with tumor surface cell specific proteins 
6. Kinase inhibitors - target kinases **inside** cells which regulate pathways 
7. Miscellaneous - like 8-9 of those.
