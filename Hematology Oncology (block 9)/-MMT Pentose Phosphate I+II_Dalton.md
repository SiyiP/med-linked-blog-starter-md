![[3. Pentose Phosphate I and II_Dalton_NOTES (1).pdf]]
Introduction - it's also known as hexose monophosphate shunt - feeds off glycolysis and ultimately re-enters 
I. Overview of primary products and their functions
- glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD is the rate limiting enzyme. most common enzymopathy. 
pentose -> ribose 5 phosphate is the main product, made into prpp for nucleotides
phosphate - also generation of nadph to generate reducing powers. these are the key products!!! -> 
	reductive biosynthesis of FA, steroids, cholesterol, deoxynuc, neurotransmitters, and also making **reduced glutathione to defend ROS**! also makes ROS for host defense :P
- ribose 5 phosphate - synthesizing nuc acids + cofactors of ATP NAD, NADPH FAD CoA etc... also used to interconvert sugars... to convert the pentose sugars into glycolytic intermediates, generating atp
nad/nadh vs nadp/nadph
- nad+ = catabolic rxns, breakdown fuel moelcules
- nadh less abundant by far... so **nad**+ is valued as oxidizing agent particularly in glycolysis 
- NADPH = more abundant in cell than nadp+ ... so it's valued as reducing agent, more likely to donate and do anabolic buildup reactions

II. Tissue specificity  - upregulated in tissues that have steroid synthesis, (adrenal, testes, ovary), fatty synthesis (liver, adipose, mammary gland)
- phagocytes have highest nadph = host defense, making a lot f ROS
- RBCs - make a big role, no mitochondria, so they need to make sure they **rely heavily on the PPP for all their nadph** - very oxygen rich environment, a lot of ROS, so they use this to combat this with glutathione. 

Pathway 
![[pentose phosphate pathway]]
I. Oxidative phase 3 rxns altogether, 2 NADPH made 
II. Non-oxidative phase 
recall - transketolase as a first step need B1 , thiamine; TPP prosthetic 
- transketolase always uses xylulose 5P as a ketose donor. 
C5+C5 -> C3+C7 with transKETOlase- transfer **two carbons**
C3+C7 -> C6 + C4 transALDOlase - bc we transfer **three carbons**
C4+C5 -> C6+C3 with transKETOlase again, basically making  Fructose 6P + another glyceraldehyde 3P we can actually feed back into the glucose 
**NET: 3C5 <=> 2C6 + 1C3**

**thiamine deficiency**
- TPP - used in pyruvate DH, 
- alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
- branched chain a-keto acid DH complex
- Transketolase (ppP)
- beri-beri  is what it leads to in high rice diets
- and wernicke korsakoff bc alc will interfere with this absorption 
- treat with IV/IM thiamine 
diagnosing it - test for it **using transketolase activity of RBCs!!!**
- measuring NADH
- take blood draw, split in half as control and other sample put in thiamine. 
- if thiamine lvls inadequate, transketolase activity will rise in added sample. 
- basically transketolase will make G3P which will eventually make DHAP -> Glycerol 3P.... **which will use NADH to make it**
	DHAP -> glycerol 3-P using NADH and gly3PDH
	NADH measured with light loss, very easy and cheap to measure 

Cellular Scenarios; When does the cell use the pentose phosphate pathway? 
the cell can use these 2 oxidative v non-ox phases depending on biomolecular reqs at that time
- if we only need NADPH : to fight against ROS/pathogens, glutathione, only req NADPH component! 
	- oxidative phase! then carbon shuffle with non-ox back to the components. with fructose1,6 bp, gluconeogenesis RLS will be upregulated to push it back up to the glucose 6 phosphate more oxidative! 
	- basically focusing on upreg **gluconeogenesis**
- if we NEED to just replicate DNA, we need both nadph + RIBOSE-6-P
	- oxidative phase, and then just stop it at ribose 5P, no non-ox phase 
		- enzymes that needed nadph in the nucleotide metabolism pathway: ribonucleotide reductase(makes it deoxyribose), dihydorfolate reductase(regenerates the TMP, folate derivative)
		- [[-MMT Nucleotide Metabolism I+II_Dalton]]
- if we need to biosyn cholesterol or FAs... 
	- we would make oxidative phase and then non-ox, with a focus on **glycolysis, to push to pyruvate and then ATP**
- RNA synthesis - we would only need ribose-5P, so no need for nadph
	- basically we would simply use more of the non-ox phase, and then take **frutose 6P and glyceraldehyde 3P to make more ribose 5P!!!**
		- note - we are focusing more on **glycolysis** here by pushing the actions of phosphofructokinase to make more fructose 6P and glyceraldehyde 3P 

what if we can't make NADPH? imbalanced NADPH
- inability to fight infection
- hemolytic anemia
- acetaminophen drug tol / overdose 

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
I. Mechanism 
entry of G6P into the PPP is **regulated by NADP+ levels, will be activated by more**
glucose 6 P -> 6-phosphoglucono-lactone
- this will be active in many alll forms, but more active at dimer or most on tetramer
- NADP+ will bind to 2 sites and stabilize it, as a coenzyme AND structural site stabilizer!!!
	- **basically the more NADP+ the more higher order G6PDH you will have**
II. Deficiency - mutation tend to cluster around the structural site, not able to make the higher order more stable active structures
- most severe - Mediterranean region
- X linked disorder, most common enzymopathy
- most in africa, mediterranean and south asia
- major 1/3 case of neonatal jaundice
- mostly asymptomatic, but more risk of hemolytic anemia 
extreme selection of G6PD deficiencies
- protective against malaria!!!! bc one of the parasites who cause it need **very reduced conditions to thrive, so NADPH is used for the parasites survival**
G6PDH - actually a target for chemo as well due to FA synthesis role - bc the cancer cells will rapidly make lipids for the membranes. 

Functions of NADPH 
Generation of reduced glutathione - if our RBCs don't have mt, they need to get NADPH from the PPP; and if they don't have good PPP, **they get damaged by ROS/pathogens and lyse = hemolytic anemia**
A. Reaction 
reduced glutathione = 3 groups together; same concentration as the amount of ATP , 500:1 reduced:oxidized, used as measure of cell tox
- glutamate
- cysteine = business end, reduced form is free sulfhydryl SH, used to reduce species to neutralize free radicals - major antioxidant 
- glycine
reduced glutathione synthesis by **glutathione reductase**
GSSG (oxidized) -> 2 GSH , 
- **One NADPH is used, making FADH2 -> then will affect the active site cysteines to make SH, SH**
glutathione reductase - has active sites and has all the cysteines come on in. many electron shuffling. 

B. Functions of reduced glutathione - generally asymptomatic until triggered - infections, anti-malarial/sulfa drugs, fava beans  
	i. Protection against ROS - peroxides form regularly in oxygen rich RBCs... bc phagocytes are there and make ROS, and leak out 
		glutathione peroxidases will require GSH to remake **selenolate, which is needed to reduce inside it!!!!**
		**2GSH** + ROOH -> GSSG + H2O + ROH, selenolate at the active site, reducing lipid hydroperoxides to alcohol, and then hydrogen peroxide to water. 
		- reduced glutathione molecule needed to regenerate selenolate . 
	ii. Maintain general reducing conditions - **outside our cells we have an oxidized environment but inside is reduced.** 
		a. Iron redox state (Methemoglobin) - ferrous generation of heme is needed, the 2+ form is important and if we make the 3+ form ferric form, we make Hemin instead of heme, which is inactive [[-MMT Porphyrin Metabolism I+II_Dalton]] - making nonfunctional hemoglobin ;; 
			also there's a very low affinity for oxygen in Fe3+, so we make met hemoglobin. 
			- but typically we can convert it back using met hemoglobin reductase. 
			- **congenital methemoglobinemia - AR disease, deficiency of NADH methemoglobin reductase!!!** = this is stuck here ): cyanotic and hypoxic. 
		b. Proper folding of proteins (Heinz bodies) - proteins to be excreted - will fold within itself. but inside the cell, we keep it reduced, to make sure we don't misfold the proteins 
			free sulfhydrl SH groups are "correctly folded" inside the cell. 
			but if you have oxidizing conditions, you'll oxidize all these groups and start misfolding and aggregating proteins, making disulfide bonds everywhere. 
			seen in **denatured hemoglobin aggregates = HEINZ bodies**!!! can see them as dark dots on the RBCs, increased susceptibility to the lysis, then 
				macrophages will "take bites out of them", will see bite cells as a result of clearing up heinz cells. 
		c. Hemolytic anemia and G6PD deficiency - characterized by RBC destruction
			defects in RBC membrane = hereditary spherocytosis - hard time entering vessels
			abnormal hb - thalassaemia [[-SFP Red Blood Cells I Laboratory Investigation & Classification of Anemias, RBC Production_Rinker]]
			abnormal glycolytic enzymes - **non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia**
				- hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose6p isomerase + phosphoglycerate kinase, glucose 6pdh of the PP as well! 

bad rxns to drugs
 antimalarial drugs - hydroxyquinolones, are working to **oxidize the cell!!!** - can't tolerate that oxidization in g6pdh deficiency, causing methb, etc. 
	- sulfa drug - **bringing it into oxidized state, inhibiting dihydropteroate synthase** sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim targets dhfr. 
	- fava drugs - vicine - hemolytic rxn to consumption of broad beans/chickpeas. - **vicine = ill cause anemia by direct action or by making h2o2** - basically will make more ROS!!! cannot be neutralized. 
how to screen - 
- beutler fluorescent spot test - detects this 
- measures production of NADPH with UV light!!! compare this to the split test for thiamine deficiency 
- basically **normal samples glow, but deficient ones don't**
- **false neg = in pts that are actively hemolysing** (lysed cells dump NADPH)
- less senstivie for heterozygous ffemales, order higher cost test 

	iii. Detoxification of drugs - severe hemolysis 
	- toxicity of acetaminophen - see irritability, tummy pain, gi, coma, convulsions
	- hepatotoxicity is most common due to this 
	- we have this bc we are reducing that reduced glutathione source!! 
	- basically we have like 40% acetaminophen going thru glucuronidation, 20-40 sulfation, but the issue is that 15% go thru **N-hydroxylation/rearrangement, leading to toxic rxns with NAPQI**
		- FYI = NADPH is used by CYP450 system 
	- **excess causes making of NAPQI, causing free radical dmg to liver cells** - 
		- we use reduced glutathione, but if you take in too much, you will **exhaust our stores,** and then be overwhelmed with ROS dmg
- TREAT WITH: **N-acetylcysteine, NAC which restores reduced glutathione as a precursor** - hx of hypersensitivity 

treatments to other bad rxns - remove the trigger, self-limiting cases, vaccination to reduce infection of HepB etc. 
- blood transfusions/splenectomy + bone marrow if super severe

III. Production of ROS as protection against pathogens
- highest cooncentrations of g6pd - in phagocytic cells 
- nadph oxidase uses nadph to make superoxide from molecular oxygen. 
- superoxide then generates h2o2 and other ros to kill 
- NADPH + 2O2 -> nadph oxidase to make 2O2- + H+ + NADP+ 
	- 2O (ros) can be fed into superoxide dimutase to make H2O2 (can go thru similar fenton + haber-weiss rxn)
		- can go thru myeloperoxidase to make HOCl- (ros)
	- fenton + haber-weiss to make 2 O (ROS) -> 2OH (ros)+ OH(ros) 

**chronic granulomatous dz**
- defect in nadph oxidase 
- inability to fight, 
- typically suspected with recurrent infections, use antibx prophylaxis/interferon
