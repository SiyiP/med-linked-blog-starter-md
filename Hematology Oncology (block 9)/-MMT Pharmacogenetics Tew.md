can also be called precision medicine too 
use genetics of pts to guide the drug therapies. - huge for statins, antidepressants, cancer treatment 

pharmacogenomics/pharmacogenetics - small diff in gene products determine response - for more accurate dosing + new more targeted drugs + improved healthcare 
- instead of basing starting dose on weight/age we can look @ genetic profile 

normal distribution - the bell curve, mean provides outliers that would be unusual patients. = the way we would metabolize drugs, we use this normal to choose which drugs we can do
- monogenic. - due to allelic variation at one gene
- polygenic - due to 2+ genes
- polymorphic - frequently occuring monogenic variants at 1%+ 
	- SNPs - the monogenic variants. = change in one base that can change the protein. 2 mil snps are in the human genome 

low/high responders = the tails of the bell curve. ppl you gotta work on and worry about 

polymorphic distribution - if the SNPs vary for drug metabolism/efficacy, freq distributions should be bimodal or multi modal, which reprsents separate sensitivities of pt populations + influencing treatment 
- pharmacokinetic changes
	- transporters
	- plasma protein binding 
	- metabolism
- pharmacodynamic
	- receptors
	- ion channels
	- enzymes
	- immune molecules 
**arrays of phase I + II metabolism genes** regulate pharm, like ADMET = absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity

"common examples of variation"
- codeine - a pro-drug that needs metabolism to morphine via CYP2D6... patients fall into 4 genetic subgroups and might have low levels o that, which doesn't work 
- 6-mercaptopurine - azathioprine - toxic in small part of population bc monogenic inheritance of **thiopurine methyltransferase TMPT activity** [[-MMT Chemotherapeutic Agents I+II_Tew]]
	- low tmpt activity - will mean death
	- decreased activity of this - cause severe toxicity ... with tpmt , we essentially break down the drug into an inactive thing, which will be excreted. 
	- changes in the enzyme that makes it less stable in bloodstream = basically it's more broken down so you have loss in the blood 
	at least 5% have that scary effect with this dog/medicine.  - you will get severe toxicity or severe ineffectiveness . 
genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes - both of these are there to detoxify things. changing the parent to make it different and ultimately easily excretable 
- phase 1 enzymes = altering **structure by small amount** - small but very significant like oxidization, adding hydrogen etc. 
- phase 2 enzymes = adding more bulky things - changing the drug to make it more diff from parent. 

biochem pathways are key to get pharmacogenetic findings
- ==irinotecan - toxic effects in some patients = **UDP-glucuronosyltarnsferase 1A1 gene = the variant causes toxicity**== ; basically this will add that glucuronyl group to the drug, making it more excretable
	- some ppl don't have that capacity, so they don't end up excreting the product
	- once you have that drug glucuronidated, those bacteria in your intestines can take off that glucuronyl group and reabsorb it 
- pharmacogenic advances come from phase I/II clinical trials - 
	in these trials, you look at SNPs of patients with efficacy, without, and also bias the results with targeting 

how can we use this to treat the patients?
- for ppl who are rapid metabolisms, we can do typical dose. 
- right drug for cancers are identified with this genetics things. 
- HER2+ poz gene breat cancer = trastuzumab specifically. with high levels of tyrosine kinase receptor ERBB2 
	- 2 types of her2 status
	- her2 normal number of ones even tho it's still cancer
	- her2 overexpression in ones that can respond to that med 


why are some gliomas resistant to nitrosurea alkylating agents
- anyting that alters promoter seq of NGMT methylguanine DNA methyl transferase 
- basically methylation of promoter region of ngmt might silence the genes. 
if you methylated NGMT, will reproduce, chemosensitive expression good gene ... 

for diseases like depression - this is important to treat - with antidepressants - they have serotonin receptors targetted by SSRIS with competitive re-uptake. 
- huge is p450s = phase 1 enzymes
- p4502D6 - will demethylate prozac. if you don't have this, **prozac is very active. but if you have a lot of this, we have very inactive drug**

statins - for cv disease. hmg coa redutase inhibitors. 
- genetic testing to see right dose and reduce patient risk of heart attack + stroke 
- generally - **cholesterol metabolism is influenced by many genes and factors**

blood thinners-  warfarin - to prevent blood clotting, but finding the right dose for each person is hard - **diffferences in VKORC1**
- VKORC1 - vitamin k epoxide reductase complex 1 and cytochrome CYP2C9 , a major p450 which will break it down into inactive metabolites
- different cytochrome p50s will reduce and or process it in diff places - 
- most often we are given warfarin as an isomer mix = either excessive sensitivity or resistance
	- **homozygosity of cyp2c9 = sensitivity so that not much is needed**
	- **coding mutations in VKORC1 gene can cause warfarin resistance so that we need more per day**
- different amino acid changes can result in different things of a range - common is to test their genetics more

red + blonde headed people - associated with need for more anesthesia
- commonly held belief that they would respond to meds diff from those with dark hair. 
- 20% more anesthetic required for the non-brunette. 
- red hair = associated with mutations on the **melanocortin-1 receptor gene MC1R** , used to be involved in melanogenesis
	- loss of function -> inc expression of red pigment + decreased production of eumelanin 
	- MC1R gene = involved w complex neuromodulatory regulation in the CNS 
	- they need more anesthesia!! MCR1 has 2 roles, one as a receiver for pigment hormones and one for pain relieving hormone endorphins . need more otc like advils and stuff

labels of 20+ meds now mention availability of tests for genetic variations, but it's optional still 
- physicians can order test from med lab, and some major huge institutions have a cheek swab. tests = a few hundred, covered by insurance. 
- cancer biopsy samples = also given to genetic tests, which help guide therapy + predict likelihood of recurrence. 

human polymorphisms of GSTP 
glutathione s-transferase - some polymorphic variants - where the cystine residue is . we have it all compared to the wildtype 
- to detoxify ROS... some like the D genotype = less able to get rid of them. only 1% of europeans. 

are results of pharmacogenetic tests confidential - protected by state laws... but issue about knowing susceptibility of disease is a huge impact. - you might wanna test ur kids if you have it etc. ethics

design of trials for pharm companies = now based on whether you have that special gene that can be impacted by the drug 

cancer example - **KRAS** G12C inhibitors in non small cell lung cancer. 
 - thought to have been undruggable target, that gly -> cystine means that now it can be targetted - it's 13% of NSCLC
 - driver mutation = **kras is a GTPase, so constitutive activation of that leads to tumor proliferation**
 - we can use mechanism of adagrasib - to bind that KRAS G12C mutant protein which traps it in inactive state = only effective w this one mutation! 
toxicities - fairly manageable diarrhea, nausea, qt prolonging  + avoid cyp3A4 inducers/inhibitors + adjust dose in hepatic impairment 
now NGS testing is non-negotiable before prescribing
