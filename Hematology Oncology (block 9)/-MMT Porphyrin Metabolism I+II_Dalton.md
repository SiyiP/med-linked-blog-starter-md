Overview of porphyrin metabolism 
A. Pyrrole structure - porphyrin is a part of that, pyrrole ring is 4 in each heme molecule corner
![[porphyrin structure]]major porphyrin in animas = heme. major in plants, there's chloropyll, they have mg coordination
we have iron coordination



B. Porphyrin input-output - 
![[Porphyrin input-output overview.png|506x245]]
under urine+feces = stercobulin (gives brown color)
succinyl coA + glycine -> delta aminolevulinic acid -> heme synthesis pathway 
- most cells can make heme bc they need it 
- when it's in ring form, it's a chromophore + has red associated to it 
release of iron + opening -> biliverdin -> reduction to bilirubin (hydrophobic needs to be converted for excretion)
- this breakdown process = in reticuloendothelial cells (resident macrophages in spleen, liver, marrow)

C. Hemoproteins - heme = prosthetic group - non peptide, covalently linked to proteins
for some myoglobin + hemoglobin = o2 transport
cytochromes - CYP450 etc -and in the ER/mitochondria - all to coordinate it and have heme
cytochrome of ER = to add double bonds, drug synthesis
Cytochromes of mt = P3450, a, a3, b3, c1, c = all nodes in ETC
catalases - to neutralize h2o2 to water etc. 
heme + apaoprotein -> holoproteins like hemoglobin/myoglobin/cytochromes etc. 

D. Heme synthesis overview
![[heme synthesis overview.png|505x396]]
know all the blue enzymes. 
**ALA synthase = rate limiting enzyme!** 
porphobilinogen = a pyrrole ring structure. then joining these together to make linear *tetrapyrrole* molecule 
protoporphyrin IX = basically heme molecule but without the Fe2 + in the middle (needs to add ferrous form with ferrochelatase)

methylene bridges in tetrapyrrole ring will connect them 
- also it's a conjugated structure! bc of the double bonds! 
	- **when it is conjugated, it is a chromophore, meaning it has a color to it**

Heme synthesis 
A. Steps involved in heme synthesis 
	i. ALA synthesis: the rate-limiting step - **joining succinyl coA TCA + glycine**
		- any usage of ALA synthase uses PLP , giving off CO2 + CoASH, and ultimately delta-ALA
		- **HEME + HEMIN** = **repress + allosterically inhibit ALA synthase** (Hemin = coordinated with fe3-, an inactive hemin molecule in ferric iron form) - oxidized form of heme. 
		- also hemin = doesn't carry o2, but still regulates ALA synthase. 
	ii. Anaplerotic reactions provide precursors for heme synthesis - we start with succinyl coA of TCA. 
		- if some of the TCA intermediates are depleted, we render this energy deficient
		- anaplerotic rxn - pyruvate to oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase , or pyruvate to acetyle coA to citrate= to help out with making stuff 
			- oxaloacetates -> aspartate, glucose, other AAs
			- citrate -> FA sterols
			- alpha ketoglutarate ->glutamate, AAs. 
		- **to make pyruvate = lactate, glucose, alanine**
		- ILE, met, thr, valine -> succinyl coA 
		- glutamate -> alpha ketoglutarate 
		- citrate food sources -> citrate
	iii. Porphobilinogen synthesis
		- ALA dehyrase - joins 2 ALA to make porphyobilinogen , has an A and P sidechain 
		- A = acetate, and P = propionate = both acidic
		- the acetate with the ammonia group - going to get removed. 
			- directly impacted upon lead toxicity - **lead = inhibitor of enzyme, it REPLACES ZINC which is the cofactor linked to the sulfhydryl group of ALA dehydrase**
		- dietary zinc deficiency will impair this enzyme too -> anemia. ![[porphobilinogen sidechains.png|274x235]]
	iv. Hydroxymethylbilane synthesis 
		- we use 4 porphobilinogens to make this linear tetrapyrrole (joined by **methylene groups. hydrosymethylbilane**)
		- enzyme = porphobilinogen deaminase
		- sidechains all in AP designation
	v. Uroporphyrinogen III synthesis
		- uroporphyrinogen III synthase - will make the tetrapyrrole ring - **note - we FLIP the last 2 sidechains of the last ring** - APAPA**PP**A = _there's an asymmetry to this!!!_
			- this is not conjugated yet, colorless but also abundant in nature 
	vi. Coproporphyrinogen III synthesis 
		- uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase will decarboxylate, remove that carboxyl group from **acetyl A sidechain, giving off O2 and leaving methyl sidechain**
		- A -> M for all sidechains 
	vii. Protoporphyrin IX synthesis 
		- not worry about the enzyme
		- decarboxylation of side chains , with propionyl P sidechain, we will -O2, **top 2 sidechains of only 2 rings** -> vinyl groups. 
			- bottom P sidechains need to remain!!! only alter the P-> V for 2 
			- oxidize ring structure = **protoporphyrin IX, now conjugated and red**
		- no iron yet, fewer charges 
	viii. Formation of heme 
		- add iron into center, ferrous 2+ ferrochelatase given.

Undertaken // uroporphyrinogen III 
Careful  // coproporphyrinogen III 
Preparations // protoporphyrin I

B. Compartmentation of heme synthesis - some in mt , some in cyt
- within the matrix, first rxn with ALA synthase uses succinyl coA + glycine 
- everything else is in the cyt, and then it **begins to be in the mt again**
- starting with the creation of protoporphyrin IX!!! when it gets colorful 2nd to last

C. Regulations of heme synthesis
- heme + hemin repress ALA synthase
- hemin will also allosterically bind to ALA synthase
- both also regulate transport of ALA synthase TRANSPORTER into the mt

Heme synthesis related diseases 
A. Lead poisoning -> **hypochromic (pale in color, chromophores not made), microcytic (smaller, hemoglobin not made, so it ends up small) anemia,** basophilic stippling (not unique to lead toxicity, also with some heavy metal toxins)
- lack of clear symptoms , think of things that come from this pathway 
	- primary direct reason for lead impairment = inactivation of **ALA dehydrase**
	- Inactivates ferrochelatase INDIRECTLY, results in formation of **zinc protoporphyrin**
		- bc irons not there, so zn can end up spontaneously in that site. 
		- zn protoporphyrin = direct MARKER for lead poisoning
- hard to environmentally change
- huge impact in kids - anemia + **profound encephalopathic crisis bc they're still developing myelin**
- adults - fatigue, abdominal pain, arthralgia 
- can lead to death 

B. Porphyrias - buildup of porphyrins due to partial deficiency off heme synthesizing enzymes except for ALA synthase - many symptoms mimic diseases, hard to diagnose. 
all of these = **light sensitive, blistering of skin, light reactive forms of these buildups, usually cyclic structures...//**
	i. Acute intermittent porphyria -> porphobilinogen deaminase partial deficiency, Autosomal Dominant!!, often recurrences happen. 
		accumulation of ALA + porphobilinogen; not caused by lack of heme, but by accumulation, seen in blood, urine, CSF 
		attacks are mysterious and incapacitating, chronic over time. attacks come and go without warning... 
			note - 90% of ppl with the genetic trait never have symptoms 
		5 Ps of AIP: - **only porphyria not associated with light sensitivity**
		- **Painful abdomen**, intractable;; many ppl end up with exploratory surgery ): 
		**- Port wine-colored urine  **
		- **Polyneuropathy** - nervous trembling
		- **Psychological disturbances** - altered consciousness, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
		- **Precipitated by drugs;** **fatal** with *barbiturates*, phenytoin, tranquilizers, *antipsychotics*, hypnotics
			- you upregulate cyt P450 in order to proess MORE drugs, requiring MORE heme, like with cyt384, needing this so most heme depletion = 
				- derepression of ALA synthase reactivates this pathway, making even more ALA + porphobilinogen PBG. 
		- also terrible insomnia ):
		- treatment - ==withdraw offending drugs. + administer hematin, which inhibits ALA synthase... and carb-rich diet which represses the same enzyme== - like with glucose repressing ALA synthase. 
			- Hematin is a therapeutic form of hemin that can be administered to individuals with Acute Intermittent Porphyria.  Hemin represses transcription of the ALA synthase precursor protein and allosterically inhibits activity of ALA synthase. Therefore, hemin reduces further formation of ALA and porphobilinogen, two neurotoxic substances that build up in AIP and cause significant symptoms.
	ii. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria -> uroporphyrinogen III synthase - basically this is supposed to make the linear go to the tetrad cycle!!!
		- what happens instead is spontaneously we make **uroporphyrinogen I, where the sidechains are NOT asymmetrical!!! APAPAPAP**
			- this is LIGHT REACTIVE, but Hydroxymethylbilane, which accumulates at first before becoming light reactive uroporphyrinogen is NOT. 
			- we get blisters bc uroporphyrinogen I is made, ulcers and skin blisters, 
				- ulcerating vesicles of the hans + face, disfiguring and can get infected
		- lysis of RBCs  due to **free radical dmg associated with light** = enlargement of spleen, hemolytic anemia
		- RED wine colored urine. 
	iii. Porphyria cutanea tarda -> uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase which make A->M is deficient, accumulation of the uroporphyrinogen III
		sensitive with sunlight, react with the photons in the skin and its metabolites accumulate
		hypersensitivity to sunlight
		20% familial, 80% sporadic (due to other conditions inhibiting the enzyme, like hepC and alc use disorder) form. **most common subtype of porphyrias**
		- frequent - alc use disorder + hep c = sporadic 
		- many ppl don't experience symptoms. but if they do, primarily seen with blistering exposed to sunlight. 

Heme catabolism 
A. Heme catabolism overview 
![[heme breakdown and bilirubin.png|591x390]]
heme processed in spleen's macrophages specifically there, breaking down heme 
- heme oxygenase -> biliverdin 
- then biliverdin reductase makes it into bilirubin
- bilirubin excreted into plasma, associated with albumin bc it's totally hydrophobic 
- travels to hepatocytes, where liver takes up the bilirubin into the ER, solutizing it with UDP-glcUA, then makes it **conjugated via glucuronyl transferase**
- conjugated bilirubin thru canaliculus then biliary system

B. Formation of biliverdin and bilirubin 
heme oxygenase - making of biliverdin , green 
	Heme oxygenase is one of the cytochrome P450 enzymes. It liberates iron and carbon monoxide from heme. The result is the green-colored bile pigment biliverdin.
biliverdin will be acted on by biliverdin reductase -> bilirubin, important antioxidant

C. Conjugation of bilirubin
bilirubin = indirect/unconjugated -> bilirubin diglucuronide conjugated/direct
- UDP-glucuronosyl transferase adds 2 UDP-glucUA, making it direct. 
- when we add on it, we use UDP to activate it, and give it the energy to actually make that bond 
- **when this UDP-glucuronosyl transferase is mutated, leads to crigler najjar** [[Crigler-Najjar syndrome]]

D. Final fates of bilirubin
- **bilirubin can be used to scavenge the free radicals, will help out by doing this and donating e- to become biliverdin again!!1**
- bruising will give out bilirubin- just FYI in bruise healing 
	- red/purple = heme
	- green - biliverdin with the scavenging of rbcs
	- orange - bilirubin
conjugated bilirubin with MRP2 across bile canaliculi, thru gallbladder -> small intestine when needed -> large intestine , removal of glucuronic acid molecule, -> bilirubin -> urobilinogen UBG, colorless
- 20% of this UBG goes thru the portal circulation and is reused. 
- some of this UBG goes past the liver, going into **systemic circulation** -> oxidized into urobilins, and absorbed by kidneys -> goes into urine to make it yellow 
- 80% UBG stays in large intestine, making oxidization to make stercobilin of feces brown! 
	- if color of feces off, might have to do with this 

Heme catabolism related disease 
A. Bilirubin accumulation and jaundice - due to bilirubin hyperbilirubinemia or by abundance of carotenoid pigments 
- sclera of eye - huge difference and indicator of hyperbilirubinemia

B. Types of jaundice
- prehepatic - excessive hemolysis usually , like if RBCs can't deal with ROS. 
- hepatic - defect in transport(no MRP2 taking it across into bile canaliculi), lack of UDP-glucuronyl transferase(can't solubilize bilirubin, crigler-najjar, premature infant with immature liver), liver dysfunction in general 
	- treat infants with blue light therapy, modding the bilirubin molecule and a more soluble form of it 
- posthepatic - biliary obstruction - like if there's a tumor in pancreas/gallbladder or stone. prevent bile flow into intestine via gallbladder. 
	- **pale feces with this obstruction of jaundice**
