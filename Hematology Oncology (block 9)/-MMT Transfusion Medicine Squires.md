![[4. Transfusion Medicine I-The Basics_Squires_NOTES1.pdf]]- note this also has a notes section that is cumulative of all of his presentations. 
but we only are tested on whatever comes from the lectures and slides. 

what's transfused? 
- ==components - whole blood, rbcs, plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, granulocytes==
- ==derivatives - factor 8,9, etc etc... all come out of pharmacy== 
collection of whole blood - what comes out of the vein - mainly centrifuged, getting rbcs on bottom, plasma on top, and separate the two. 
- ==all the antibodies are in the plasma. so in the rbcs there's antigens==, and in the plasma has all antibodies 
- ==solution with citrate used to anticoagulate collected blood== 
- aphaeresis - uses centrifugation into components. - will centrifuge into components 

all donors - risk factors - syphilis, hep, hiv/chagas, zika, etc. - all testing for these 

Don't worry about blood component vol/storage, just have an idea - that rbcs have so much volume. might help you in knowing that you might wanna transfuse that much into a patient. 
==things we can do to make blood safer:== 
- ==Leukoreduction LR - remove wbcs from red cell/platelet products - **makes you safe from CMV!!!**==
- ==irradiation - using rays or gamma - **makes lymphocytes unable to proliferate, preventing GvHD in immunocomp patients!**==
- Washing - removes plasma on red cell and plasma units with some saline... 

immunohematology - biggest thing 
rbc - has surface of carbohydrates, glycoproteins, etc. antigens. 
- if person's exposed to rbcs other than their own thru preg/transfusion, small genetic variations in these can be immunologically recognizable, resulting in antibody prod 
agglutination or hemolysis can happen if the patient's antibodies react with the transfused antigens. 
we're concerned with IgG/IgM
- agglutination - is what we test at the blood bank , this clumping 
- ==igM - cold reacting - strongly reactive below 25 c, and not clinically significant== 
	- ==mainly causing intravascular hemolysis, complete obliteration bc strong complement== 
	- ==think of like schistocytes, which is microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and common with intravascular causes==
	- but a few anti-A and anti-B to be wide thermal amplitude, most strongly at 37 C, which makes them clinical. 
	- ==real danger of the acute hemolytic transfusion rxn = **kidney dmg or DIC**==
		- ==associated with factor 12, basically activated by hemolysis, activation of bradykinin + coagulation cascade==
	- most igM are naturally occurring and happens due to environmental stimuli; we normally have anti-A and anti-B 
	- ==a great complement activator==, just one single pentameric igM can bind C1q but C1q needs 2 igG adjacent. 
- ==igG - best react at 37 degrees making them clinically significant + **exposure to foreign rbcs make it arise - unexpected antibodies**==
	- ==extravascular hemolysis = think of *spherocytes*, which is like autoimmune hemolytic anemia; milder symptoms== 
	- ==also there is removal via reticuloendothelial cells of spleen + liver - **phagocytic cells take bites** - bite cells== 
	- worse complement activator
O/A/B/AB
- all antigens on surface of red cell
- ==Rh antigen - if you have it you're Rh poz and if you don't it's neg.== 
ABO
- all based on a common precursor carbohydrate - **called a precursor substance**
	1. add a fucose to the precursor chain which -> **h substance = which is interpreted as type O**
	2. add N-acetylgalactosamine to H substance -> **A blood type**. if instead d-galactose is added, **b blood type**

- AB has both the chains!
- we inherit the specific blood group but we also acquire the naturally occurring antibodies (early in life, call them isoagglutinins.) naturally occurring ones are predominantly IgM with minor IgG component - most likely environmentally stimulated
	- type A ppl have anti-B
	- type  B have anti-A
	- type O has both 
	- type AB has neither
think of: 
- antigens in RBC - corresponds to blood type - 
	- ==**forward typing** - to denote test down to determine this abo antigen on the surface== 
- antibodies in plasma 
	- ==**reverse typing- confirmatry, looking for anti-A/B/whatever in their *plasma* - what antibodies do you have**==
- if forward and reverse type doesn't match - ABO typing discrepancy 
	- must be resolved before emergent situations ... such as weakly expressed A/B antigens or absent blood group antibodies in the immunocompromised. 
inheritance - 
- O = think of as recessive 
- codominant: A and B
- each person has 2 gene for the blood type, so blood type A can have AA or AO and so on 

==weak subgroups - there's multiple variants of A; there's A1 (strong, 80% of the population), and A2==
- A1 - strong, 80% of the population 
- A2 - more weakly , might even make an antiA1 antibody 
	- some people with this can occasionally be kidney donors. 

==bombay phenotype== 
- ==recall - first step of blood is to add fucose... to terminal galactose of precursor... **this requires functional H gene... but if this is non functional, you have bombay's phenotype.**==
	- ==bombay's is h/h instead of H/H , no H substance is made.== 
	- we cannot add anything that'll make you A or B ... happens in very rare type - Oh deonated. 
	- ==clinically significant anti-A, anti-B and anti-H is made, causing hemolysis = **can't get O blood!**==
	- bombay can only be transfused with another bombay person 

Rh - rhesus - protein is a big thing, along it it projects to the external surface of the red cell 
- over 50 specific ones, some are like : always worry abou tthese. 
- D - d antigen no allele - 
	- if we have the D = Rh positive = **highly immunogenic.** we will get an antibody basically 
	- if we don't have it = Rh negative. 
- C/c - allelic antigens
- E/e - allelic antigens 

==**Rh null blood - no Rh antigens at all! no D antigen or anything else**==
- ==mild compensated hemolytic anemia, retiulocytosis, elevated bilirubin, stomatocytosis== 
- can only be transfused with another rh null 

so many diff blood groups and rbc antigens
- most of these will make antibodies in the 2-3% range

pre-transfusion - 
- testing them - with ABO + Rh testing
- antibody screen is done to make sure if they have developed an antibody to any other blood group antigen like anti-K, etc etc. 
- the antibody screens done by combing serum + screening rbcs
	- agglutination = antibody to an antigen is present , more extensive testing 
Coombs reagent - antihuman globulin/AHG
- ==coombs reagent = solution of IgG antibodies, tiny little jobs. directed to FC of igG. can be clinically significant but can't agglutinate; allows crosslink from igG molecule on one RBC to IgG on another RBC==
- IgG too small to agglutinate bc they are NOT IgM 
- allows crosslinking from an IgG molecule on one RBC to IgG on another RBC and makes an agglutinate -
- with the help of Coombs, we can see that there's an antibody in the pt attached to an rbc -> **indirect antiglobulin test**

select type compatible blood - separate blood cells + plasma is important 
- if we have A pt, give A blood etc etc... screen for whatever antigens there are
- if pt is a b, and you go to inventory and there's no b blood... we can give him O. **but only if it's red cells and not whole blood - no a or b antigen on it.**
look at what antibodies the recipient has (the recipient antibodies are **in plasma!!**), and basically the donors, the only thing going in is the red blood cells - dw about the antibodies in them. 
- compatibility testing - we would cross match pt serum with rbcs from donors as final check. 

==platelet - **all abo groups are acceptable for any pt. but women of childbearing age and younger wh are Rh neg receive Rh neg platelets**==
- plasma - compatible with red cells
- cryoprecipitate - all ABO groups acceptable 
- granulocytes - compatible with recipients plasma, and women of childbearing age and younger who are Rh neg receive Rh neg granulocytes

==![[blood type transfusions.png]]==

ideally - platelets should be type compatible but any type can be transfused bc platelets have a few RBC in them so rh group applies. 

transfusions - 2 identifiers + ppl comparing the information just in case. 

Direct antiglobulin test - DAT - is it a transfusion rxn? 
- not routine part of pre transfusion test
- to determine if here's a igG antibody or complement attached to rbc surface. ==if the direct antiglobulin test is poz:== 
	- ==hemolytic transfusion rxn==
	- ==hemolytic dz of fetus an newborn== 
	- ==autoimmune hemolysis== 
	- ==drug induced autoantibodies== 

![[4a. Transfusion Medicine II-Blood Use_Squires_NOTES.pdf]]
blood components
- rbcs - commonly transfused, to restore or maintain **oxygen carrying capacity - nothing else!**
	- anemia, active blooding, chronic transfusions like thalassemias/anemias
	- ==anemia - in transfusion it's when they're anemic but key is not compensated well like with symptoms of weakness/fatigue/dyspnea, tachy, etc. hb is a bad guideline for transfusion - never transfuse asymptomatic anemia.== 
	- guidelines - if 10+ hb, don't transfuse unless symptoms indicated. ==<6 hemoglobin = transfusion indicated.== 
	- ==active bleeding - might need transfusion - but the hb doesn't mean much, rely on clinical symptoms==, estimated blood loss and symptoms. not too good at testing how much would help 
- when to transfusion - surgery - need for this is set up by surgeons in different hospitals
- reducing need for rbc transfusion 
	- ==reducing rbc transfusion need: anemia should be corrected pre surg== 
	- ==normovolemic hemodilution - whole blood collected from pt at start of surgery and replaced with saline==, then blood have re-infused at the end of surgery 
	- ==intraoperative blood salvage - blood lost can be collected, filtered and returned at the end==
- when to transfuse in trauma - ==trauma resuscitation - stop the lethal triad: hemodilution, acidosis, hypothermia== , mainly based on their symptoms - major complications is the coagulopathy f trauma can be exacerbated 
- active bleeding protocols of massive transfusion 
	- ==**specifically for trauma - RBC:Plasma:platelets in 1:1:1 ratio - all group O until known.**==
	- use type O whole blood only more frequently in trauma resuscitation ... basically replace everything all at once time  
- ==thalassemia - transfuse every 2-4 weeks, require chronic ones to prevent anemia and helping you replace the hb== 
- ==sickle cell dz - SCD - point mutation on b globulin chain, distorting rbc, vaso occlusive; to relieve symptoms, inc o2 carrying, decrease blood viscosity== 
	- happens to relieve symptoms associated with crises... and reduce strokes. goals to improve o2 carrying, decrease blood viscocity , suppress endogenous erythropoiesis (we give them new hb)
	- ==complication with chronic transfusions - iron overload with tooo much== 

platelet transfusions
- either derived from whole blood products (50 mL and 4-6 products are pooled together) 
- or collected by ==apheresis (300 mL platelets and each is a full adult dose)==
- given to pts who are thrombocytopenic (dysfunction of platelets to prevent/stop bleeding)
- ==<10k transfuse... <50k transfuse for invasive procedure==
- post transfusion platlet increment... - ==transfusion of 1 apheresis platelet to non-bleeding normal patient with norm spleen should increase platelet count from 30k to 40k== 
	- ==**we should make it go up by 1 gram!!!**==
	- ==or by **10k**==
- refractory pts to platelets
	- ==refractory patients to platelets basically might not get any boosts at all.== causes:
		- spleen issues, sepsis, fever, meds
		- ==immune: HLA or platelet specific antibodies==
			- this is alloimmunization due to blood exposure...  
			- ==we can give **HLA-matched products, hla-a or hla-b that allows us to give**==
			- or ==**cross matched platelet products, to determine any that might be compatible**==
			- ^^^basically huge issue! we need to know

plasma 
- apheresis - they have all the coagulation factors in it!!! 
- ==plasma is used for active bleeding due to **multiple coagulation factor deficiencies like liver dz**==
- pt with a single coagulation factor deficiency for which no manufactured coagulation factor is available - 8,9,7 are commercially produed..
- ==**rapid reversal of warfarin** - but nowadays prothrombin complex concentrate is now recommended for this... **or reverse with IV vitamin K**== 
==cryoprecipitate - made from plasma frozen within 8 hrs of collection== - they are cold-insoluble proteins
	==has factor 8(not used to treat hemophilia A bc we already got factor 8 concentrate), 13, vWF, fibrinogen== 
	==- to treat decreased or abnormal fibrinogen pts <100== 
	==- some pts with vWD type 3 or type 2 who aren't responsive to DDAVP== 
	==- rare pts with factor 13 def==

==granulocyte transfusions - only for severely granulocytic pts who are septic+with no improvement== and are currently treated with no improvement with antibiotics 

special transfusion situations 
autoantibodies
- autoimmune hemolytic anemias are either caused by 
	- igG - warm AIHA - incompatible cross match. **incompatible with own blood**
	- igM - cold agglutinin dz 
- some are life threatening others are indolent. 
- issue with some transfusions - crossmatches incompatible... **we need to transfuse "incompatible blood!"** transfusing these pts would not necessarily worsen hemolysis, but we need to see if they have other blood group antibodies such as anti-e, anti-kell etc that can cause hemolytic transfusion rxns. 
	- danger that that auto antibody would be hiding an alloantibody - have they been transfused in the past? blood bank needs some special techniques to eliminate the autoantibodies in the crossmatch and see if alloantibodies are present \
==bone marrow transplants- depend on ABO compatibility between pt and donor==
- but for ==stem cells - ABO compatibility is not a barrier!!!== requires in unique issues;
	- blood product compatibility - specific compatibility guides for each blood type 
	- immunocompromised - all bone marrow transplant pts are immunocompromised so they need irradiated cellular products (not solid organs; bc cellular products have lymphocytes we should irradiate them)

==hemolytic dz of fetus + newborn HDFN==
- ==anemia / hyperbilirubinemia== of fetus/newborn due to incompatibility 
- ==caused by IgG maternal==.... but not good if that's a blood group antibody, basically making baby's rbcs destroyed
2 categories
- ==ABO HDFN - most of these cases== 
	- ==most common mom group O (a ton of IgG anti A and B) and baby group A/B, where typeA/B have small amount of IgG antiA/b== and type A/B have very small amount of IgG antiA/anti-B
	- ==mild, bilirubin postnatally, affecting first and subsequent pregnancies==
- ==immune antibody HDFN Rh or other antibody== 
	- ==caused by stimulated/immune antibodies, 40%==
	- ==most commonly anti-D crosses over==
	- symptoms are ==severe , later pregnancies== 
	- happens when rh- mom exposed to rh poz blood (which has a D antigen) via transfusion or fetal maternal hemorrhage from previous pregnancy (increases each trimester w greatest risk at delivery) 
	- ==prenatal - anemic, high output heart failure, edema, polyhydramnios - **hydrops fetalis** - babies can survive this with prenatal care. 98% survive==
	- ==postnatally - anemia still, hyperbilirubinemia due to hemolysis -> kernicterus== basically , **liver immature** and can't conjugate all the bilirubin buildup -> demise due to neurological complications 
	- at first prenatal visit - we do ABO/Rh antibody screen.... if Rh-neg mom and screen neg - go to prevention (she has no antibody - we need to make sure she doesnt develop any)
		- ==we give Rh-immune globulin RhIg - solution of antibodies to D antigen that *prevents* development of an anti-d antibody in Rh negative individuals==
		- this is ==something we do regardless to make sure she doesn't have this issue with future pregnancies on the case of a bleed.==
		- ==after delivery, figure out if baby is Rh poz or neg. if Rh poz neonate, assess fetal maternal hemorrhage, and give RhIg basically== - how much of the bleed did the mom get ? ): 
			- be4 28 wks, Fetal Maternal Hemorrhage is rare, volume small so 1 dose RhIg sufficient
			- at delivery check approx volume of fetal maternal hemorrhage in case:
				- ==rosette test of maternal hemorrhage - **big or small? if small, one dose is ok, but if large, more needed**==
				- ==kleihauer-betke test - how many doses of RhIG are necessary? the quantitative test that we look to the volume of fetal rbcs==
	- if ==rh poz mom, screen poz or rh neg and screen poz, we would eval -> they already got an antibody==. what antibody is positive? some antibodies can cause HDFN and some don't 
		- ==if IgG v IgM... then do a maternal titer if IgG antibody. higher titer, esp past 8 = more severe HDFN. more likely to cause fetal risk.== 
		- if titer <8 repeat titer. 8+ , fetus affected 
		- we can do ==fetal middle cerebal artery systolic blood flow velocity doppler==. - basically to check how the baby is affected. 
		- if the baby's MCA is affected, aka the middle cerebral artery - we can do an intrauterine transfusion for the greatest risk ones to increase hb. 
			- should be antigen negative for offending antibody , O-negative, irradiated to prevent GVHD, CMV safe, and blood lacking hb S, fresh blood, etc
		- manage at birth - phototherapy, IVIg, or exchange transfusion (only when you have to)


![[4b. Transfusion Medicine III-Transfusion Complications_Squires_NOTES.pdf]]

 ==Non‐Infectious Transfusion Complications== • Classified by predominant symptom 
 ==Allergic - most common adverse rxns - see hives/urticaria, weezing, angioedema, flushing.== 
 ==most commonly type 1== hypersensitivie, the allergen ==some transfused plasma protein combines with pre-formed IgE antibody on surface of mast cells + basophils of recipient== -< activates them to release many anaphylatoxins ; degranulations 
 - ==emergently - suspend transfusion, treat with antihistamine; prednisone alone, then restart transfusion if hives **resolve**==
 - prevent; repeated allergnic rxns only happen in minority of ppl, most get a antihistamine prior to transfusions but we don't know if it works. generally helpful when it occurs. 
 ==Anaphylactic txf. rx. •==
- ==more srs with all the allergy symptoms plus severe hypotension/shock==
- basically result from IgE hypersensitivity 1 
- main thing that ==might cause this is **deficiency in IgA** - basically eventually if you give more and more IgA, they might make IgA antibodies...== 
	- ==we need to wash the platelets and the transfusion to remove all the IgA==. as for plasma, there's IgA deficient donors who donate and they use that. 
	- ==treat - stop transfusion and **do not restart** , supportive oxygenation, stabilize hypotension - **crystalloids, epinephrine, dopamine if unresponsive**==

Hemolytic - typically happen when antigen poz rbcs transfused into pt with allo-antibody 
-  ==Acute hemolytic transfusion. reaction. - within 24 hrs of transfusion, where antibody is present== 
	- start with ==fevers + chills - pain , dyspnea, hypothension, hemoglobinemia,==
	- ==haptoglobin down bc that binds to free hb, ldh up== 
	- usually the ==pre-existing anti-a or anti-b of patient attached to the incompatibly transfused red cells... (anti A/B usually IgM, giving rise to complement mediated intravascular hemolysis -> **"completely obliterated" bc complement is strong, we see schistocytes**==)
		- ==causing hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria on top of bilirubin going up== 
		- some igG can also do this but mainly causes extravascular hemolysis  -> 
	- ==stop transfusion, maintain venous access, infuse saline, maintain urine, bp, watch the pt. almost all of these are due to error.== 

- ==Delayed hemolytic txf. rx. - after 24 hrs alloantibody is not detectable at time of transfusion but develops later==
	- ==hardly any symptoms, unexpected anemia + jaundice.; inevitable and self-limited== 
	- why is that? bc we don't make that antibody until days after, tend to rise but then disappear over time unless we stimulate them. unlikely to build up to hemolysis 
	- TREAT: unnecessary - transfusion might be required ; unavoidable bc it's undetectable 
- think of the site of hemolysis: 
	- intravascular hemolysis - requires fixation of complement to red cell, by IgG and IgM ; 
		- requires classical activation of complement with IgM antibodies potent activators bc a single one can bind C1q activating it. IgG less likely, leads to membrane attack complex and lysis eventually 
		- IgM antiA and IgM antib most commonly causes issues 
		- real danger - **kidney dmg or DIC**, can happen due to an acute hemolytic transfusion rxn. 
			- might be associated w factor 12, basically activated by hemolysis , which would **produce more and more bradykinin** (less important- causing hypotension thru production, and can also have 12 activate coagulation cascade, tNf-a and IL-1 which can cause DIC 
	- extravascular hemolysis - IgG mostly causes this, more mild symptoms   -
		- when complement cascade not activated the binding of Igg to rbcs opsonizes RBCs, resulting in removal via reticuloendothelial cells of spleen + liver - **phagocytic cells take bites** - bite cells 
- lab checks - clerical check - make sure there's no wrong matchups 
	- recipient blood sample - hemolysis visual, confirm pt abo, direct antigobulin test/Coombs. 
	- blood product check -retype blood product 

==Respiratory Rxns== - sorta similar - both in dyspneic patients, after transfusion they get bilateral pulmonary infiltrates!!!!
- ==Transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI) -==
	- ==fever/chills + hypotension, central venous pressure, CVP normal to low== 
	- ==antibody problem - this time, **it's in the blood product, from the donor that are directed against recipient**==
		- happens to look like the same HLA type. veryy common, donor antibodies are directed against recipient. - for sure. donor has antibody that goes to pts. 
	==TREAT: stop transfusion, prompt resp support, vasopressors for hypotension, ususlly helps in 5 days.== 
	prevent by ==minimizing use of donors with anti-leukocyte/HLA antibodies, like multiparous females==
	- produce transfusable plasma platelets from predominantly male donors 
- ==Transfusion‐associated circulatory overload (TACO) •== 
	- ==orthopnea, htn, CVP elevated - we overloaded this guy !== 
	- simple volume overload!! 
	- BNP up , not reliable but useful when elevated 
	- ==TREAT: stop transfusion, diuretics help, manage symptoms with support,==
	- prevent - carefully manage ppl with CVD, elderly, congestive heart failure, infants. slow infusion rate. 

==Miscellaneous== 
- ==Febrile nonhemolytic txf. rx. - relatively common - no long term impact on pts== 
	- ==1-2 degree rise in temp during or in 4 hrs of transfusion, +- the chill/rigors.== 
	- pathophys of ==wbcs and cytokines elaborated in donor blood.== 
	- ==TREAT: antipyretics not aspirin/leukoreduction of blood product reduces risk of febrile rxns , basically reduce the platelets and red cells, cuts risk in half.== 
- ==Graft versus host disease -== 
	- ==very rare, only severely immunocomp patients like ppl with hodgkins, congenital immunodef, neonates, bone marrow transplant pts, etc.== 
	- rash, liver function test abnormalities, diarrhea, n/v, pancytopenia(decrease in all three blood cell types), ==symptoms begin 7-10 days post transfusion; all die ): only thing we do is prevent it by irradiation if the patient needs it.== 
	- ==in an average pt with normal immune system - viable lymphocytes in any cellular product will be destroyed==
		- ==but in immunocompromised pts, recognition of donor lymphocytes don't happen, so donor colonizes pts and proliferate.== 
		- graft v host dz = the tissue death reaction. 
- ==Platelet‐associated reactions - both associated with thrombocytopenia, severe bleed risk, low platelet count, alloantibody dev to platelet specific antigens like HPA-1a aka GPIIIa==
	- ==post transfusion purpura PTP - adults , sudden onset 5-10 days post transfusion, <10k, previous hx transfusion/pregnancy== 
		- in ==pts who are HPA-1a antigen negative.... any transfusion can lead to this development==. uniquely in ptp ==not only are these platelets destroyed but ALSO the patient's own; a bystander effect== 
		  HPA-1a negative platelets are also destroyed -> severe thrombocytopenia 
		- ==TREAT: IVIg - HPA-1a neg platelets can be helpful in acute phase , but future ones should use rbcs and platelets known to be hpa-1a negative.== 
	- ==neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia - fetal/neonatal, platelets <20k== 
		- ==women neg for this antigen can develop this when fetus is hpa-1a poz and most are== 
		- ==antibody crosses placenta and sensitizes fetal platelets, resulting in severe thrombocytopenia in fetus in first pregnancy.== 
		- if one is affected many will be too 
		- ==TREAT: antenatal IVIg with or without steroids or intrauterine platelet transfusion with HPA-1a negative platelets== 
- ==Iron Overload - issue in pts who are chronically transfused.== 
	- each unit can have iron deposits in liver, heart, pancrease etc
	- ==symptoms - lethargy, fatigue, liver dmg, increased risk of diabetes, heart dz, arthritis==
	- ==TREAT: chelation== 
	- dw abt pts in trauma getting this, they bleed it all out. 

==Infectious Complications== - Classified by infectious agent 
==pathogen reduction = in platelet - new tech become available and further reduces this risk - basically we take the== 
- ==take the blood, add **psoralen** reagant and then it gets into the DNA, then expose it to UV radiation, sticking it to all the dna and making it unable to replicate== making it not replicate
- risk of all these dz are gone - done for platelets having no risk of diseases
REAL risk of blood transfusion - mainly error 
Virus - "risk is small, all donor questions are answered"-
- Hepatitis B 
- Hepatitis C 
- HIV 
- HTLV 
Bacteria - can grow, still a risk 
- Bacterial contamination 
- Syphilis (T. pallidum) - 
Protozoa 
- Malaria (Plasmodium sp.) 
- Chagas (T. cruzi) 
Other 
- Prions (variant Creutzfeld‐Jacob Disease)
