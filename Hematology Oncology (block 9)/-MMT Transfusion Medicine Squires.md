![[4. Transfusion Medicine I-The Basics_Squires_NOTES1.pdf]]- note this also has a notes section that is cumulative of all of his presentations. 
but we only are tested on whatever comes from the lectures and slides. 

what's transfused? 
- components - whole blood, rbcs, plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, granulocytes
- derivatives - factor 8,9, etc etc... all come out of pharmacy 
collection of whole blood - what comes out of the vein - mainly centrifused, getting rbcs on bottom, plasma on top, and separate the two. 
- all the antibodies are in the plasma. so in the rbcs there's antigens, and in the plasma has all antibodies 
- solution with citrate used to anticoagulate collected blood 
- apheresis - uses centrifugation into components. - will centrifuge into components 

all donors - risk factors - syphilis, hep, hiv/chagas, zika, etc. - all testing for these 

don't worry about blood component vol/storage, just have an idea - that rbcs have so much volume. might help you in knowing that you might wanna transfuse that much into a patient. 
- Leukoreduction LR - remove wbcs from red cell/platelet products - **makes you safe from CMV!!!**
- irradiation - using rays or gamma - **makes lymphocytes unable to proliferate, preventing GvHD in immunocomp patients!**
- Washing - removes plasma on red cell and plasma units with some saline... 

immunohematology - biggest thing 
rbc - has surface of carbohydrates, glycoproteins, etc. antigens. 
- if person's exposed to rbcs other than their own thru preg/transfusion, small genetic variations in these can be immunologically recognizable, resulting in antibody prod 
agglutination or hemolysis can happen if the patient's antibodies react with the transfused antigens. 
we're concerend with IgG/IgM
- agglutination - is what we test at the blood bank , this clumping 
- igM - cold reacting - strongly reactive below 25 c, and not clinically significant 
	- but a few like anti-A and anti-B to be wide thermal amplitude, most strongly at 37 C, which makes them clinical. 
	- most igM are naturally occuring and happens due to environmental stimuli; we normally have anti-A and anti-B 
	- a great complement activator, just one single pentameric igM can bind C1q but C1q needs 2 igG adjacent. 
- igG - best react at 37 degrees making them clinically significant + **exposure to foreign rbcs make it arise - unexpected antibodies**
	- worse complement activator
O/A/B/AB
- all antigens on surface of red cell
- Rh antigen - if you have it you're poz and if you don't it's neg. 
ABO
- all based on a common precursor carbohydrate - **called a precursor substance**
	1. add a fucose to the precursor chain which -> **h substance = which is interpreted as type O**
	2. add N-acetylgalactosamine to H substance -> **A blood type**. if instead d-galactose is added, **b blood type**
- AB has both the chains!
- we inherit the specific blood group but we also acquire the naturally occurring antibodies (early in life, call them isoagglutinins.) naturally occurring ones are predominantly IgM with minor IgG component - most likely environmentally stimulated
	- type A ppl have anti-B
	- type  B have anti-A
	- type O has both 
	- type AB has neither
think of: 
- antigens in RBC - corresponds to blood type - 
	- **forward typing** - to denote test down to determine this abo antigen on the surface 
- antibodies in plasma 
	- **reverse typing- confirmatry, looking for anti-A/B/whatever in their plasma - what antibodies do you have**
- if forward and reverse type doesn't match - ABO typing discrepancy 
	- must be resolved before emergent situations ... such as weakly expressed A/B antigens or absent blood group antibodies in the immunocompromised. 
inheritance - 
- O = think of as recessive 
- codominant: A and B
- each person has 2 gene for the blood type, so blood type A can have AA or AO and so on 

weak subgroups - there's multiple variants of A
- A1 - strong, 80% of the population 
- A2 - more weakly , might even make an antiA1 antibody 
	- some people with this can occasionally be kidney donors. 

bombay phenotype 
- recall - first step is to add fucose... to terminal galactose of precursor... **this requires functional H gene... but if this is non functional**
	- h/h instead of H/H , no H substance is made. 
	- we cannot add anything that'll make you A or B ... happens in very rare type - Oh deonated. 
	- clinically significant anti-A, anti-B and anti-H is made, causing hemolysis = **can't get O blood!**
	- bombay can only be transfused with another bombay person 

Rh - rhesus - protein is a big thing, along it it projects ot the external surface of the red cell 
- over 50 specific ones, some are like : always worry abou tthese. 
- D - d antigen no allele - 
	- if we have the D = Rh positive = **highly immunogenic.** we will get an antibody basically 
	- if we don't have it = Rh negative. 
- C/c - allelic antigens
- E/e - allelic antigens 

**Rh null blood - no Rh antigens at all! no D antigen or anything else**
- mild compensated hemolytic anemia, retiulocytosis, elevated bilirubin, stomatocytosis 
- can only be transfused with another rh null 

so many diff blood groups and rbc antigens
- most of these will make antibodies in the 2-3% range

pre-transfusion - 
- testing them - with ABO + Rh testing
- antibody screen is done to make sure if they have developed an antibody to any other blood group antigen like anti-K, etc etc. 
- the antibody screens done by combing serum + screening rbcs
	- agglutination = antibody to an antigen is present , more extensive testing 
Coombs reagent - antihuman globulin/AHG
- solution of IgG antibodies, tiny little jobs. directed to FC of igG. can be clinically significant but can't agglutinate
- IgG too small to agglutinate bc they are NOT IgM 
- allows crosslinking from an IgG molecule on one RBC to IgG on anothre RBC and makes an agglutinate -
- with the help of coombs, we can see that there's an antibody in the pt attached to an rbc -> **indirect antiglobulin test**

select type compatible blood - separate blood cells + plasma is important 
- if we have A pt, give A blood etc etc... screen for whatever antigens there are
- if pt is a b, and you go to inventory and there's no b blood... we can give him O. **but only if it's red cells and not whole blood - no a or b antigen on it.**
look at what antibodies the recipient has (the recipient antibodies are **in plasma!!**), and basically the donors, the only thing going in is the red blood cells - dw about the antibodies in them. 
- compatibility testing - we would cross match pt serum with rbcs from donors as final check. 

platelet - **all abo groups are acceptable for any pt. but women of childbearing age and younger wh are Rh neg receive Rh neg platelets**
- plasma - compatible with red cells
- cryoprecipitate - all ABO groups acceptable 
- granulocytes - compatible with recipients plasma, and women of childbearing age and younger who are Rh neg receive Rh neg granulocytes

ideally - platelets should be type compatible but any type can be transfused bc platelets have a few RBC in them so rh group applies. 

transfusions - 2 identifiers + ppl comparing the information just in case. 

Direct antiglobulin test - DAT - is it a transfusion rxn? 
- not routine part of pre transfusion test
- to determine if here's a igG antibody or complement attached to rbc surface. if poz: 
	- hemolytic transfusion rxn
	- hemolytic dz of fetus an newborn 
	- autoimmune hemolysis 
	- drug induced autoantibodies
