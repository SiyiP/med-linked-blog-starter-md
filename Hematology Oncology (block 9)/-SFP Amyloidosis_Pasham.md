protein misfolding 

think congo red and fibrosis - what can we do for this person? hard to treat, how do we get rid of all that deposition? we ==have good preventative measures but hard to remove== ): 

amyloidosis - looks like amyloid .... just description of ==extracellular depo of abnormal proteins, can be localized or systemic. classified based on protein identity.== 
- AL = amyloid lightchain. 
- ==amylase is due to excess production or mutant protein or defective proteolytic mechanisms !==  

associated with many disorders - whole meaning is that ==abnormal fibrils are resistant to macrophage destruction==
- ==**abnormally folded into beta pleated sheets->fibrils fold together-> which are very stable and which macrophages won't eat**==
deposits wherever it wants, but there can be specific places. due to the systemic nature of this, this can have a wide clinical presentation. so in our differentials, we should include this 
- this is ==biochemically very heterogenous! but morphologically homogenous== 

AL type is most common, then the AA type 
==systemic amyloidosis== 
1. ==plasma cell proliferations with amyloidosis - primary amyloidosis = AL fibrils with the immunoglobulin light chain; usually systemic leading== 
	- the most common one, ==monoclonal processes; typically multiple myeloma associations==
	- AL fibril protein, immunoglobulin light chain 
2.  reactive systemic amyloidosis - secondary amyloidosis; where chronic inflammatory cells -> AA amyloidosis, upreg IL-1 upregulation more protein production, etc. 
	- in the rest of the world, we have a lot of chronic infections like tb, which can lead to a deposition. 
3. ==hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis - beta2-microglobulin== - the ==dialysis membrane in the past, not now. the membrane wouldn't be calibrated so the beta 2 would accumulate from being retained in the blood, causing polyneuropathy== etc.... 
	- doesn't rlly happen anymore bc we changed out dialysis membranes! 
	- ==put into the joints and synovial spaces.== 
==hereditary amyloidosis== 
4. ==familial mediterranean fever - AA derived, mutant IL-1 causes all inflammation in the linings of your tissues== like perimetrium etc. 
5. ==familial amyloidotic neuropathies (several) - **transthyretin - huge hereditary cause!!! has ATTR as the fibril protein**==
6. ==systemic senile amyloidosis - **transthyretin (transporter or hormone thyroxine T4) - huge hereditary cause!!! has ATTR as the fibril protein**==
localized amyloidosis might be too niche 

associations with 
- plasma cell dyscrasias like Ig light chains
- chronic inflammation 
- alzheimers (amyloid b protein)
- familial conditions too with TRR or transthyretin - **transporter of hromone thyroxine**
- dialysis associated b-2 microglobulin 

==AL = primary amyloidosis - usually systemic==
- something making excess light chains, mainly AL light chains of IgG
- ==most are AL bc they are amylogenic and misfolds , so most freq lambda== 
- usually some monoclonal thing behind it like ==MGUS or plasma cell neoplasm==, not always multiple myeloma [[-SFP White Blood Cells I-IV_Rinker]]
- ==treat with SPEP or bone marrow biopsy most likely== 
	- kidney biopsy too in this case
- ==**bone marrow biopsy to look for any neoplasm, then do mass spec**==

==AA = reactive systemic amyloidosis==
- ==chronic inflammation -> macrophage activation -> IL1 and IL6 -> liver cells make more SAA, serum amyloid associated protein (this is an acute phase response in inflammatory states)==
- ==limited proteolysis of SAA will cause AA protein== 
- ==RA, CT disorders, IBS, chronic infections like TB== 
- **shows that the chronic dz is not under control, and ==we can fix just by giving more immunosuppression**==

Transthyretin TTR 
- familial amyloid polyneuropathies
- age associated = sytsemic senile amyloid

b2-macroglobulin
- 10 years of long term dialysis , joints + tendons affected
- patients present with carpal tunnel 

b-amyloid Ab protein 
- derived from **amyloid precursor protein**
- core of cerebral plaques in alzheimers + in vessel walls
soooo many other amyloid proteins including hromone + keratin (very niche)

==nonspecific systemic symptoms==
- ==weakness, fatigue, weight loss==
- cutaneous ecchymoses around eyes = raccoon eyes
	- ==periorbital purpura due to depo in small capillaries, causing bleeding around eyes== 
- macroglossia - massively enlarged, accumulations 
- ==**proteinuria -> nephrotic syndrome**==
- ==GI bleeds==
- ==neuropathy== 
- ==hepatosplenomegaly== 
- ==insidious CHF, arrhythmias, **restrictive** cardiomyopathy== 
suspect amyloidosis if you see these systemic things with MGUS
- ==**AL amyloidosis = specific for it:  raccoon eyes ecchymoses x macroglossia x shoulder pad sign!!!!**==

dx 
- ==DX: biopsy + then congo red staining==
- you need to ==id the precursor protein - we need to type what we can do and suppress precursor protein== 
- ==**you must immunostain + tandem mass spectrometry**== 
- waxy appearance to the cortex
	- ==**abnormal glomerulus = we see amorphous pink hyaline material instead of a good amount of cellularity**==
	- ==podocytes - can't do their jobs anymore, which is what causes the proteinuria== 
- **apple green birefringence.** = when we put it under polarized light under congo red 
- ==congo red stain =apple green birefringence== 
- ==randomly arranged fibrils== under electron microscope 

heart shows - ==<3 shows waxy surface + **expansion of interstitium, exactly like from the kidney into the heart. small bites== = take some biopsies...**
- but just bc it's not in that small biopsy sample doesn't mean we don't have it = a l**ot of false negatives**

prognosis
- depends on type
- but systemic one is poor ): 
- goal of mangement is to suppress precursor protein by treating underlying dz.... so if it's ig light chain, treatment of plasma cell dyscrasia can halt progression 
- supportive care for associated complications like CHF + CKD
