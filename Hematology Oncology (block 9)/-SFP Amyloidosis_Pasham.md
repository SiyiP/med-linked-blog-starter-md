protein misfolding 

think congo red and fibrosis - what can we do for this person? hard to treat, how do we get rid of all that deposition? we have good preventative measures but hard to remove ): 

amyloidosis - looks like amyloid .... just description of extracellular depo of abnormal proteins, can be localized or systemic. classified based on protein identity. 
- AL = amyloid lightchain - most common thing AS. 
- due to excess production or mutant protein or defective proteolytic mechanisms !  

associated with many disorders - whole meaning is that abnormal fibrils are resistant to macrophage destruction
- **abnormally folded into beta pleated sheets->fibrils fold together-> which are very stable and which macrophages won't eat**
deposits wherever it wants, but there can be specific places. due to the systemic nature of this, this can have a wide clinical presentation. so in our differentials, we should include this 
- this is biochemically very heterogenous! but morphologically homogenous 

AL type is most common, then the AA type 
systemic amyloidosis 
1. plasma cell proliferations with amyloidosis - primary amyloidosis 
	- the most common one, monoclonal processes but typically multiple myeloma associations
	- AL fibril protein, immunoglobulin light chain 
2.  reactive systemic amyloidosis - secondary amyloidosis; where chronic inflammatory cells -> AA amyloidosis, upreg IL-1 upregulation more protein production, etc. 
	- in the rest of the world, we have a lot of chronic infections like tb, which can lead to a deposition. 
3. hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis - beta2-microglobulin - the dialysis membrane in the past wouldn't be calibrated so the beta 2 would accumulate from being retained in the blood, causing polyneuropathy etc.... 
	- doesn't rlly happen anymore bc we changed out dialysis membranes! 
	- put into the joints and synovial spaces. 
hereditary amyloidosis 
4. familial mediterranean fever - AA derived, mutant IL-1 causes all inflammation in the linings of your tissues like perimetrium etc. 
5. familial amyloidotic neuropathies (several) - **transthyretin - huge hereditary cause!!! has ATTR as the fibril protein**
6. systemic senile amyloidosis - **transthyretin - huge hereditary cause!!! has ATTR as the fibril protein**
localized amyloidosis might be too niche 

associations with 
- plasma cell dyscrasias like Ig light chains
- chronic inflammation 
- alzheimers (amyloid b protein)
- familial conditions too with TRR or transthyretin - **transporter of hromone thyroxine**
- dialysis associated b-2 microglobulin 

AL = primary amyloidosis - usually systemic
- something making excess light chains, mainly AL light chains of IgG
- most are AL bc they are amylogenic and misfolds , so most freq lambda 
- usually some monoclonal thing behind it like MGUS or plasma cell neoplasm, not always multiple myeloma [[-SFP White Blood Cells I-IV_Rinker]]
- treat with SPEP or bone marrow biopsy most likely 
	- kidney biopsy too in this case
- **bone marrow biopsy to look for any neoplasm, then do mass spec**

AA = reactive systemic amyloidosis
- chronic inflammation -> macrophage activation -> IL1 and IL6 -> liver cells make more SAA, serum amyloid associated protein (this is an acute phase response in inflammatory states)
- limited proteolysis of SAA will cause AA protein 
- RA, CT disorders, IBS, chronic infection are some of the causes 
- **shows that the chronic dz is not under control, and we can fix just by giving more immunosuppression**

Transthyretin TTR 
- familial amyloid polyneuropathies
- age associated = sytsemic senile amyloid

b2-macroglobulin
- 10 years of long term dialysis , joints + tendons affected
- patients present with carpal tunnel 

b-amyloid Ab protein 
- derived from **amyloid precursor protein**
- core of cerebral plaques in alzheimers + in vessel walls
soooo many other amyloid proteins including hromone + keratin (very niche)

nonspecific systemic symptoms
- weakness, fatigue, weight loss
- cutaneous ecchymoses around eyes = raccoon eyes
	- periorbital purpura due to depo in small capillaries, causing bleeding around eyes 
- macroglossia - massively enlarged, accumulations 
- **proteinuria -> nephrotic syndrome**
- GI bleeds
- neuropathy 
- hepatosplenomegaly 
- insidious CHF, arrhythmias, **restrictive** cardiomyopathy 
suspect amyloidosis if you see these systemic things with MGUS
- **AL amyloidosis = specific for it:  raccoon eyes x macroglossia x shoulder pad sign!!!!**

dx 
- biopsy + then congo red staining
- you need to id the precursor protein - we need to type what we can do 
- **you must immunostain + tandem mass spectrometry** 
- waxy appearance to the cortex
	- **abnormal glomerulus = we see amorhpous pink hyaline material instead of a good amount of cellularity**
	- podocytes - can't do their jobs anymore, which is what causes the proteinuria 
- **apple green birefringence.** = when we put it under polarized light under congo red 
- congo red stain = red in bright field 
- randomly arranged fibrils under electron microscope 

heart shows - waxy surface + **expansion of interstitium, exactly like from the kidney into the heart. small bites = take some biopsies...**
- but just bc it's not in that small biopsy sample doesn't mean we don't have it = a l**ot of false negatives**

prognosis
- depends on type
- but systemic one is poor ): 
- goal of mangement is to suppress precursor protein by treating underlying dz.... so if it's ig light chain, treatment of plasma cell dyscrasia can halt progression 
- supportive care for associated complications like CHF + CKD
