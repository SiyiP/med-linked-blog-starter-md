autoimmune dz = 5-8% of us population, mainly females 
- organ-specific or systemic. either or! 
- single organ - hashimotos, pernicious anemia, good pasture's 

tolerance = unresponsiveness to antigen induced by previous exposure to that antigen. 
- self antigen - if you have too strong or too weak binding you can delete 
- self tolerance = just right = lack of responsiveness to self-antigens = development of Tregs can further suppress + b cells can also go thru deletion or receptor editing!! [[-HRR Immunological Tolerance and Autoimmunity_Baker Frost]]
- immune periphery - tolerance can occur there
- tolerance also occurs thru b7 and ctla 4 binding 
- or fast pass ligand => cell death + deletion of any self lymphocytes to be present. 
mechanisms of tolerance
- elimination of self reactive lymphocytes during development
- suppression by Treg
- inib by lymphocyte activation by inhib receptors
- deaht of self-reactive lymphocytes 

recall your tolerance breaking mutations(very rare): 
- AIRE mutation => autoimmune polyglandular syndrome when your self antigen's dont' appear and get presented in the thymus , manifestations of several autoimmune dz
- FOXP3 = improper dev + activity of Tregs if mutated. -> IPEX - immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, Xlinked 
- FAs/Fas L mutations -> no proper apoptosis + you get a lot of representation of self lymphocytes => autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome 

no simple answers to why MOST ppl have autoimmune dz tho - combo of genetic and epigenetic factors possibly 
or some type of environmental exposure like smoking/diet changes... **basically genetic susceptibility might be there, but then environmental trigger would act on it, leading to tissue destrubtion of that person, activation of self-reactive lymphocytes**

genetic factors
- **familial clustering, greater incidence in monozygotic twins than dizygoutic**
- HLA linkage usually class II and recall penetrance is not 100%
- induction of autoimmune dz in HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis 
- some association with viral or bacterial infections
		- EBV + SLE development eventually 
	- microbe induces APC + is presented. if yu have the self- t cell can exhibit response to both the self antigen + virus => causing autoimmunity 
	- molecular mimicry - microbe taken up and then the microbe antigen will look similar to the t cell!!! they still get activated and still cause destruction 
	- b cell and microbe binds to its receptor. then the b cell -> plasma cell, producing a cross reacting antibody => autoimmunity 

ANAs - antinuclear antibodies 
when your body makes autoantibodies, they're made up of nucleus 
4 categories:
- ab to DNA
- ab to histones
- ab to non-histone proteins bound to RNA
- antibodies to nucleolar antigens 

ANA patterns!!! - anti-nuclear antibody = **we don't know which component of the nucleus it is yet (:**
- homogenous = dsDNA with nucleosomes + histones = common with SLE 
- speckled => least specific, nuclear antigens to smith antigen (anti-smith antibody), ribonucleoproteins - RNPs = also seen with SLE
- centormeres inside the nucleus - think systemic sclerosis 
- nucleolar pattern = systemic sclerosis

sometimes there's more than one pattern but note we always use the disease presentation to truly dx the disease. no lab tests are 100% sensitive/specific + treatment modalities are controversial and not always effective

For the following diseases know the pathogenesis (as far as it is known), the clinical presentation(s) and diagnostic criteria, and the end organ complications: 
1. Systemic lupus erythematosus (Introduction - dedicated lecture tomorrow)  
	- ANA , Anti-dsDNA, anti-SMith
	- drug induced = anti-histone antibody 
	- autoimmune + multi system, vast array of autoantibodies, typical manifestations but very unpredictable and variable in behavior. acute or insidious as well, virutally involves every organ in body 
	- note - we have clinical criteria and immunolgic criteria ... we need both for the full picture
		- prototypical: young woman with butterfly rash - reddish area on cheeks + nose. fever , pain **in joints *without* deformity.** - difference from RA... and pleuritic chest pain   + photosensitivity with the rash. also **positive aNA test but just bc it's poz doesn't mean its necessarily lupus**
		- we can follow the complement cascade too = C3 + 4 is low bc it's activated and being deposited in the organs 
2. Rheumatoid arthritis and seronegative spondyloarthropathies 
	- RA = anti-CCP, rheumatoid factor 
	- joint fixed deformities 
3. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
4. Sjogren syndrome 
	- anti-ro, anti-la 
5. Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)  
6. Inflammatory myopathies 
7. Mixed Connective Tissue Disease 
8. IgG4 related disease
