TBL:
risk factors, hx, phys ex, lab eval : 
develop illness scripts for: 
- SLE, RA, seronegative spondyloarthropathies
- sjogren syndrome
- scleroderma - SS
- inflammatory myopathies
	- dermatomysitis + inflam. myositis
- mixed CT disease 
- IgG4 related disease 

==autoimmune differentials for raynauds:== 
- ==limited scleroderma + mixed CT disease!== 

==differentials for joint pain== 
- ==SLE without deformation== 
- ==RA with deformation== 
- ==if larger bones = think arthritis== 
- ==men affected with seronegative + joint fusion== 
- ==juvenile idiopathic arthritis fewer and larger bones affected==
- ==scleroderma too but it's more interested in calcium depots== 

==autoimmune dz = 5-8% of us population, mainly females== 
- organ-specific or systemic. either or! 
- ==single organ - hashimotos, pernicious anemia, good pasture's== 

==tolerance = unresponsiveness to antigen induced by previous exposure to that antigen.== 
- self antigen - if you have too strong or too weak binding you can delete 
- ==self tolerance = just right, not too strong, not too weak binding = lack of responsiveness to self-antigens...== and development of Tregs can further suppress + b cells can also go thru deletion or receptor editing!! [[-HRR Immunological Tolerance and Autoimmunity_Baker Frost]]
	- immune periphery - tolerance can occur there
- tolerance also occurs thru b7 and ctla 4 binding in t cells 
- or fast pass ligand => cell death + deletion of any self lymphocytes to be present. 
==mechanisms of immune tolerance==
- ==elimination of self reactive lymphocytes during development==
- ==suppression by Treg or editing B cell receptors==
- ==inibition by lymphocyte activation by inhibitory receptors like b7/==
- ==death of self-reactive lymphocytes== 

==recall: tolerance breaking mutations:== 
- ==AIRE mutation => autoimmune polyglandular syndrome when your self antigen's dont' appear and get presented in the thymus , manifestations of several autoimmune dz==
- ==FOXP3 = improper dev + activity of Tregs if mutated. -> IPEX - immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, Xlinked XLAS==
- ==FAs/Fas L mutations -> no proper apoptosis + you get a lot of representation of self lymphocytes => autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome== 

==no simple answers to why MOST ppl have autoimmune dz== tho - combo of genetic and epigenetic factors possibly 
or some type of environmental exposure like smoking/diet changes... **basically ==genetic susceptibility might be there, but then environmental trigger would act on it, leading to tissue destruction of that person, activation of self-reactive lymphocytes==**

==genetic factors==
- ==**familial clustering==, greater incidence in monozygotic twins than dizygoutic**
- ==HLA linkage usually class II and recall penetrance is not 100%==
- ==induction of autoimmune dz in HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis== 
- some association with ==viral or bacterial infections==
		==- EBV + SLE development leads to autoimmune tolerance== 
	- ==microbe induces APC and is presented. if you have the self-t cell can exhibit response to both the self antigen + virus => causing autoimmunity== 
	- ==molecular mimicry - microbe taken up and then the microbe antigen will look similar to the t cell!!!== they still get activated and still cause destruction 
	- ==b cell and microbe binds to its receptor. then the b cell -> plasma cell, producing a cross reacting antibody => autoimmunity== 

==ANAs - antinuclear antibodies, like autoantibodies made up of nucleus!== 
when your body makes autoantibodies, they're made up of nucleus 
4 categories:
- ab to DNA
- ab to histones
- ab to non-histone proteins bound to RNA
- antibodies to nucleolar antigens 

ANA patterns!!! - anti-nuclear antibody = **we don't know which component of the nucleus it is yet (:**
- ==homogenous = dsDNA with nucleosomes + histones = common with SLE== 
- ==speckled => least specific, nuclear antigens to smith antigen (anti-smith antibody), ribonucleoproteins - RNPs = also seen with SLE; just "nonspecific" and possibly normal in older patients== 
- ==centromeres inside the nucleus - think systemic sclerosis, mostly the limited version==
- ==nucleolar pattern = systemic sclerosis, the nonlimited version== 
==![[anca patterns.png]]==
another pov: [[-HRR Introduction to Clinical Immunological Tests_Litwin]]
sometimes there's more than one pattern but note we always use the disease presentation to truly dx the disease. no lab tests are 100% sensitive/specific + treatment modalities are controversial and not always effective

For the following diseases know the pathogenesis (as far as it is known), the clinical presentation(s) and diagnostic criteria, and the end organ complications: 
1. ==Systemic lupus erythematosus== (Introduction - dedicated lecture tomorrow)  
	- ==ANA , Anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith==
	- ==drug induced = **anti-histone antibody** => translates to homogenous pattern==  
	- autoimmune + multi system, vast array of autoantibodies, typical manifestations but very unpredictable and variable in behavior. ==acute or insidious as well, virtually involves every organ in body== 
	- note - we have clinical criteria and immunologic criteria ... we need both for the full picture
		- prototypical: ==young woman with butterfly rash - reddish area on cheeks + nose. fever , pain **in joints *without* deformity.**== - difference from RA... and ==pleuritic chest pain   + photosensitivity== with the rash. also **positive ANA test but just bc it's poz doesn't mean its necessarily lupus**
		- MARKER: ==we can follow the complement cascade too to check for FLAREUPs = C3 + 4 is low bc it's activated and being deposited in the organs if we have an active flare-up== 
	- ==**seizures = the most frequent neurologic abnormalities in SLE, might have a cns vasculitis, microthrombi, small vessel vasculopathy, metabolic encephalopathy etc.**==
	- skin abnormalities of rashes - **common manifestations of immune complex dz, ==uv light inducing widespread breaks in DNA, so release of this is a starting point of making immune complexes form, but they're dysfunctional or not able to act up right, staying deposited in the joints==.**
	- ==lupus nephritis = one of the highest concerns about this with protein creatinine + proteinuria== 
2. ==Rheumatoid arthritis==   
	- RA = ==anti-CCP(more specific)+ RF==
	- ==joint fixed deformities; also can develop **subcutaneous nodules on the forearm, which might improve**== ; nonsuppurative proliferative synovitis / pannus leading to articular cartilage . ==bilateral + polyarticular+ small joints== too ): 
	- **we get ==inflammation in the synovium**==
	- systemic - other organs are involved, very common women > men. at any age
	- joint pain ==**worse in the morning**,== MORNING STIFFNESS IS HUGE!!! typically smaller joints are involved, not typically hip/knee/shoulder (usually other arthritis)
	- ==inflammatory markers CRP + ESR are elevated== 
3. ==seronegative spondyloarthropathies== [[-SFP History and Clinical Manifestations of Rheumatological Disorders_Baker Frost]]
	- kinda grouped in with RA but not rlly? 
	- happens to mostly MEN!! ==younger male== too 
	- ==umbrella term like juvenile idiopathic arthritis = **several chronic inflammatory arthritis dz affecting the vertebral column**==
		- ==we get changes in ligamentous attachment to BONE rather than synovium (enthesitis) unlike RA== 
		- no RF, ==antiCCP==
		- ==**hallmark achilles tendon happens inflammation**== 
	- strong association with ==HLA-B27== 
	- ==**bony proliferation can lead to ankyloses== - which is fusion of joints in the end ):** -> ==inc risk of osteoporosis==;; **you get ==loss of lumbar lordosis, fusion of vertebral bodies and hunching== over with time** 
	- pain worse in the morning + might wake them up from their sleep. 
	- ==eye inflammation too like anterior uvelitits.== 
	1. ==Reactive arthritis - **within seronegative group**==
		- classic triad = ==conjunctivitis, urethritis, asymmetric arthritis== - ==can't see, can't pee, can't climb a tree==
		- history is fundamental: if someone gets dx w ==viral infection like chlamydia/GI bug== they might get this!!! within wks of ==urethritis/diarrhea pts get **low back pain** -> pain in ankles, knees, feet==
		- ==HLA-B27== 
		- ==self-limiting but some might need longterm immunosuppressive help==  
4. ==Juvenile idiopathic arthritis== 
	- very ==umbrella== term; might have ==ESR up, poz ANA common, neg RF.== 
	- needs to have ==symptoms for 6+ wks==!!! ==onset before 16 yo==
	- compared to RA: ==fewer + larger joints , systemic dz more frequent, RF + rheumatoid nodules absent.== 
	- 6 types based on joint involvement pattern, eye-manifestations, labs, prognosis 
		- ==oligoarticular JIA = most common! asymmetric(one joint involved) involvement of **up to 4 joints** like knee==
			- associated with ==anterior uvelitis = **eye inflammation!!!**==
		- do we have to know the rest.... 
5. ==Sjogren syndrome== 
	- ==**anti-ro, anti-la**== 
	- ==50-60 older females==, dry mouth(xerostomia), dry eyes(keratoconjunctivitis sicca), ==rhuematoid arthritis==, but ==dryness== can happen to any and all mucous membranes though. 
	- can ==cause MALT lymphomas, paraneoplastic== with time [[-SFP White Blood Cells I-IV_Rinker]] - if their lymph nodes are enlarged, send for biopsy immediately 
	- note - ==internal organs can be impacted too, vasculitis as well== ... tease out what they mean by mouth dryness - does the dentist comment on that? there's test
		- ==cavities/carries/tongue fissures== = bc the mouth is super dry, caries might occur too with decay/crumbling of a tooth/bone... also tongue fissures and a lack of salivary pooling when they press their tongue to the top of their mouths 
		- in women - ==transplacental transmission -> **passed onto the fetus, causing fetal *heartblock*!!! to ensure safe delivery + development**==
	- this can occur in other diseases too, primary and secondary exist!! 
		- ==primary SS = sicca syndrome = isolated disorder==
		- ==secondary SS = associated w/ another autoimmune dz like RA most commonly== 
	- we can see ==**inc lymphocytes in the salivary tissue in biopsies**==(lots of blue cells, a huge amount, focus score >1) + swelling of parotid glands ! 
6. ==Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)==  
	- typical ==autoantibodies RNA POL III, centromere, Scl-70== 
	- typically ==30-50 yr female... this WILL lead to fibrosis==! due to uncontrolled inflammation... ==proliferative obliterative vasculopathy = **basically BVs are gone. making more ischemia, fibrosis, inflammatory stuff that contributes to autoantibodies etc**== 
	- ==raynaud=='s phenomenon = ==vasospasm== of aa in hands/feet etc... furthest from internal organs, color changes from ==white -> blue -> red.== 
		- this can happen in many different reasons like ==adhd meds, vibrating tools etc, but we should look at nail folds caplliroscopy== to determine if it's truly an autoimmune pathology 
		- ==cold agglutinations might be indicated== 
	- ==tightness== of skin, specifically of the fingers, so tight can't open/close hands + ==telangiectasias== = widened blood vessels near surface of skin, visible, blanchable. and can also be an indicator of pulm htn  
		- basically ==endothelial cell dysfunction, so you have **shunting of blood into small blood vessels, and eventually get telangiectasias to occur**==
		- ==calcium deposits== can develop due to uncontrolled inflammation in the fingers + literally every part of body 
	- difficulty, ==dysphagia/GERD(most ppl with the entire GI tract involved) + dyspnea, chronic cough, -> pulm fibrosis + pulm htn... also renal vascular dz== . sometimes microstomia - skin so tight around the mouth we can't open it 
		- ==scleroderma renal crisis== - an emergency, concentric intimal proliferation in small arteries, htn, anemia, thrombocytopenia at home for a few days !! ==**onion skinning of artery, no immune deposition bc not immune mediated!**== 
	- limited form vs diffuse form 
		- l==limited form scleroderma used to be called CREST syndrome== - good acronym for remembering scleroderma syndromes but can be generalized to any scleroderma; ==**anticentromere antibodies**==
			- ==C = calcionosis cutis; calcium buildup in the joints or any soft tissue of the body== 
			- ==raynaud phenomenon==
			- ==esophageal hypo motility== 
			- ==sclerodactyly==
			- ==telangiectasis== 
		- ==diffuse scleroderma = trunk and abdomen are affected **Scl-70 antibodies**==
7. ==Inflammatory myopathies group term, there are different types==
	- polymyositis - dx of exclusion, getting away from this term? 
	- ==dermatomyositis - most common in children isolated, inflammation of both skin + muscle.== 
		- ==**paraneoplastic disorder in adults**, see inc risk of visceral cancer - lung/ovary/stomach==... or malignancies would drive the development of these myopathies 
		- ==skin manifestations associated with interstitial lung dz==; ==heliotrope eyelids = **purpleish color**==
		- ==ESR+, **creatine kinase up AKA muscle breakdown!!!!**, ANA+==  -> and we can test myositis antibody specifically. but ==muscle biopsy gold standard==  
	- ==inclusion body myositis - MC inflammatory myopathy in pts 60+ yrs , older population== 
		- can have ==vacuoles/holes in the muscle fibers, "**rimmed vacuoles**"== 
	- all get muscle weakness - ==**large proximal muscles of shoulders/hips, like difficulty in rising from chair or climbing stairs**== any muscle can be involved. 
	- *==*insidious onset== = slowly over time until they can't compensate anymore**
	- infiltration of lymphocytes into muscles + degen/regen myocytes. 
8. ==Mixed Connective Tissue Disease== 
	- ==overlapping== clinical feat of SLE, sclerosis, polymyositis 
	- ==synovitis of fingers, raynaud phenomenon, mild myositis==
	- ==**autoantibodies to RNP , anti-u1 RNP**!!!!!!!!==
	- little renal dz, but ==excellent response to steroids!==
9. ==IgG4 related disease==
	- basically ==IgG4 producing plasma cells in tissue can be overrepresented==
	- involved the pancreas (autoimmune pancretitis), biliary tree, salivary glands, periorbital tissue, etc etc 
	- ==histologically - **MIXED infiltrate of t/b and plasma cells**==
		- ==**storiform fibrosis - swirling around!!!** + obliterative phlebitis/destruction== 
		- spiral form 
	- pathogen not well understood ): but ==**respond well to immunosuppression + B-cell depletion!**==
