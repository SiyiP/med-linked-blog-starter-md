![[1. Bleeding Disorders I-Overview_Squires_NOTES (1).pdf]] #hemonc 
*make a flowchart?*
causes = defect in primary hemostasis platelet plug, in secondary hemostasis fibrin plug, and fibrinolysis - 3 categories 

primary hemostasis - bv, platelets, von willebrane dz
secondary - clotting factors
fibrinolysis - tPA, PAI-1, and alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor 
misc coagulopathies - DIC, TTP 

what matters for this lecture - evaluation of abnormal bleeding? 
- happens after many situations
- med hx, phys exam, lab testing ofc 
med hx 
- bleeding hx - extent of bleeding? location, appearance, age of onset
- medical hx - meds? dental/surgical procedures, liver/kidney dz 
- fm hx - females males or both, any hx of consanguinity? 
**physical exam - VERYYY important to know**
- defect primary hemostasis - platelet count or functionality issue
	- bleeding gums mucocutaneous
	- superficial bruising/petechiae 
	- low platelets 
- defect in 2ndary hemostasis - inhibiting or deficiencies in coag factors
	- soft tissue hematomas, 
	- **extensive bruising**
	- hemarthroses - **bleeding into a joint space**
	- more PT or PTT - meaning **prolnged prothrombin time or partial prolonged prothrombin time**
evaluation - we should know that a bleeding abnormality actually exists
routine panel - **CBC, PT, PTT, platelet count, sometimes fibrinogen/thrombin time**
- primary hemostasis - platelets
	- platelet count/morpho = normal is 150k to 400k uL. 
		- below 150k uL is adequate for hemostasis. 
		- morhpology - not too much, new platelets are fatter... so higher mean platelet volume MPV suggest increased peripheral destruction of platelets bc the newly released type are larger. - decreased MPV = failure in bone marrow
		- **bernard-soulier syndrome = fat platelets**
	- bleeding time - poorly reproducible - time to stop bleeding , normal is 9-11 min, but is not reproducible so they stopped. 
	- light transmission aggregometry- do these platelets work well @ all?? 
		- agonists of collagen, epinephrine, ADP all cause platelets to aggregate.
		- can make a platelet rich plasma PRP , **a ton of platelets**, then we pass light thru it for baseline. 
		- then we ad an agonist = which causes them to stick together. - 
			- **platelet aggregates and solution lets more light transmission than the original suspension**
			- aggregation pattern depending on the agonist can separate two diseases 
			- graph shows time vs optical density to look at the turbidity (goes down on normal aggregation.)
	- verify now 
	- tests for vWillebrand dz - several variants are seen 
		- will measure von willebrand factor antigen to assay it 
		- ristocetin cofactor - measures amount of FUNCTIONAL von willebrane factor 
		- multimer analysis - since von willebrand factor is large and multimeric, but in certain diseases some subunits are missing. gel electrophoresis to check size ultimately 
- 2ndary - make sure to focus on pt/ptt 
recall intrinsic pathway 12,11,9.8,10 tenant // tweleve eleven nine ate ten 
common pathway - 10, 5, 2, 1; 
extrinsic pathway = 7 
if there's prolonged PT/PTT, it means there's either deficiency or inhibitor (IgG antibody present that's blocking this action)
	- PT - star - **meaning that even tho aPTT and PT assess common path, PT is MORE SENSITIVE to common path deficiencies. so deficiencies in 10,5,2,1 can be prolonged PT but normal in PTT**
		- this is extrinsic and common - 7.10,5.2,1
		- to monitor oral anticoagulant/warfarin therapy 
	- PTT- aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time = **measure of intrinsic AND common pathways**
		- normal = 23-26 s= youo'll be given this 
		- to detect a def of 12,11,9,8,10 , prekallikrein, HMWK, fibrinogen , 5,2,1 
			- HMWK = high molecular weight kininogen = can screw up the ptt reading. just be aware of this even when it's not in your pathway 
		- note - **prekalikrein, HMWK, factor 12 are all measured by the ptt - but non can result in bleeding risk**
		- monitors heparin therapy and testing for lupus 
	- mixing studies - combining pt + ptt = if ptt prolonged = 
		- difficiency in factors of 12,11,9,8,10,5,2,1
	- but if normal pt says 10,5,2, 1 are normal.... 
		- **only 12,11,9,8 are gonna be prolonging the ptt**
also if the prolonged pt but normal ptt - 
- prolonged pt = think that 7,10,2,1,5 are deficient 
- but normal ptt says 10,5,2,1 are normal. 
- only factor is 7 = the cause 
only exception - **mild deficiency of 10,5,2,1 might be detected by pt but missed by ptt**
- so a mild def of 10,5,2,1 might yield a prolong pt but normal ptt 
if they're BOTH messed up = think multiple factor deficiencies, think vitamin K def or severe liver dz. 
	-INR - international normalized ratio normalizes pt testing from one institution to another. 
	- mixing study - **if you have a pt and aPTT, due to deficiency or inhibitor.... we should see what alternative is causing this abnormally**
		- example = used to evaluate and distinguish factor def vs inhibitor. 
		- normal plasma x deficient plasma = **normal coagulation result** = factor deficiency ... the deficiency CORRECTS. 
		- abnormal result meaning it will still be prolonged is if there is an inhibitor. does NOT correct! 
	- thrombin time - TT, time for the fibrin clot to form after thrombin addition. measures from the common pathway with the addition of thrombin aka factor II 
		- prolonged with some inbhititors or with some fibrin degradation products etc. 
	- factor assays - if it's a factor deficiency - which factor is involved?? 
		- but if it's an inhibitor present = they measure them out with **bethesda unit!!!! = this is the quantity of inhibitors**
	- fibrinogen - we don't need to know how to measure it ... 100 mg/dL + is usually adequate for coagulation
		- useful in times of **emergency - DIC and liver failure or primary fibrinolysis , which guides a transfusion study**
- clot stability / fibrinolysis
	- **D-dimer = most important assay - one of the fragments released when plasmin breaks down fibrin. really huge in DIC dx. pretty common** 
		- you must make fibrin polymer, and then factor 13 will **crosslink it to make it more stable.**
		- d dimer - the crosslinked thing from the fibrin polymer. 
	- tissue plasminogen activator
	- plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1 
	- factor XIII fibrin stabilizing factor 
- whole blood clotting tests - looks at all the things together. 
	- **viscoelastometry** = used frequently in transplant, studies, etc
	- thromboelastography - TEG - measure clot formation as a whole.... fast ish output in time. 
		- don't learn these just know the tracings exist. 
		- know the thromboelastograph results to get an idea of what we might need in clotting etc.

REVIEW AND FOCUS
Vascular Disorders: 
- The most important issue in this section is simply to know that there are a number of intrinsic vascular abnormalities that can present with symptoms suggestive of primary hemostatic disorders
- Be familiar with the symptoms of HHT and Ehlers‐Danlos that are suggestive of abnormal hemostasis 

Platelet Disorders 
- There are a large number of quantitative and qualitative platelet defects presenting as defects of primary hemostasis
- While you should be familiar with each of the conditions discussed, **FOCUS on ITP, bone marrow damage, HIT, Glanzmannís and Bernard‐Spulier** 

Von Willebrand Disease 
- vWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder that you will encounter and, therefore, you should be very familiar with the information presented in the lecture including the types of vWD highlighted in the slide on vWD types

notes for the 2nd one
primary hemostasis - largely due to platelets, but also bv + von willebrand dz (aggregation/adhesion inborn condition)
vascular dz/blood vessels 
- petechiae, bruising, mucocutaneous bleeding 
- BUT **normal platelet count + functions**
be aware that vascular abnormalities can present as primary issues- just know these- **some examples ONLY don't study too hard**- 
- ehlers danlos - inherited AR/D, stretchy skin, easy bruising, collagen abnormal. = all you need to know 
- **hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia - HTT - aka osler-weber-rendu dz**
	- **red dots + lesions "blood blisters" on mucocutaneous membranes + skin** 
	- **epistaxis + GI hemorrhage**
- vasculitis
	- septic vasculitis - meningococcemia, inflammation of blood vessel wall, hemorrhagic RAISED lesions in skin 
	- henoch-schonlein purpura - aseptic, purpura, in kids + YA. after VIRAL illness, IgA **hypersensitivity rxn**, resolves in 1-2 mon 

platelets - 'intrinsic disorders = inc risk of bleeding can be placed into 6 categories'
Quantitative defects (Inherited and Acquired) 
inherited:
- thrombocytopenia w/ absent radii(TAR syndrome) - AR, no radii (**no forearm bones**)! - other skeletal and cardiac abnormalities, normal lifespan survivors of 1-2 years. 

acquired:
- **Immune thrombocytopenic purpura ITP** - common!!!! - petechiae bruising in skin, epitaxis, gingival, GI/GU bleeding. rare intracranial hemorrhage! 
	-  ==Gingival bleeding is usually seen in patients with **a platelet abnormality**==
	- chronic ITP - in adults, mostly female. 
		- not usually viral infection before; insidious, less likely to see bleeding early on 
		- months to years duraction ... uncommon remission 
	- acute ITP - in kids 1-6 yrs, equal genders. 
		- abrupt bleeding, common after viral infections
		- duration is 2-6 wks 
		- remission in 80% kids 
	- why is it so different? - pathophys - 
		- spontaneous development of autoantibody to platelet glycoproteins like - **GPIIb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor complex** and **GPIb/IX vWF receptor**
			- know these receptors
			- binding site for fibrinogen + vWF on the surface of platelets, involved in platelet aggregation + endothelial adherence.
			- this means **IgG against these receptors, whereas Glanzmann thrombasthenia is instead a deficiency in platelet gpIIb/IIIa**
		- macrophages will take up these antibodies attached and then take them outta circulation. but not all pts with itp actually demonstrate these 
	- dx - elimination - isolated thrombocytopenia and elimination of other decreased counts
		- **it presents with ppl with dx of CLL** = chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
		- Evans syndrome - coincident association of ITP as well as severe anemia
	- treat - 
		- oral prednisone - standard initial therapy but hard to control - more for adults bc it's a steroid
		- IV anti-D- Rh immune globulin - effective only in Rh poz pts and ppl who have a functioning spleen - if you give them to this, this coats all Rh poz cells, and then these macrophages would bind to all these numerous RBCs instead of the platelets. 
			- **kinda like making the RBCs = competitive inhibitors, sparing the platelets.** 
		- IV immune globulin - IVIG - tried in pts who fail prednisone
		- splenectomy - failure to respond to anything above for 3-6 mon. 
- bone marrow dmg - common!!! - can occur in 
	- aplastic anemia - toxic chem, viral infections like parvo b19 and cmv, autoimmune, and idiopathic 
	- chemo/radiation/malignancy 
	- aplastic marrow would have much less red/purple cells, more white spaces
- medications (including HIT) - heparin induced thrombocytopenia 
	- Heparin induced thrombocytopenia - they don't have really low, more of 50% lower than their baseline...  profound is rare! 4-5 days post therapy 
		- **but they don't bleed; they get thrombosis!!!!**
		- why is that - basically PF-4, platelet factor 4 is affinity to heparin, which sticks together
		- immune system sees heparin-PF4 as a "new epitope," they would make an IgG antibody which binds platelets
		- **igG antibody binds the platelet, removing platelets** = thrombocytopenia
		- **RECALL *- immune complex ACTIVATES platelets*** = causing more aggregation!!! thrombosis! 
	- other than that there's a ton of meds that will bring down platelet count, most common quinine 
	- testing for HIT - there's platelet activation assays , looking for heparin-pf-4 antibody
	- therapy - elmination all heparin exposure + move to warfarin or some other anticoagulant. after cessation, still ongoing risk for 30 days. 

Qualitative defects (Inherited and Acquired)
inherited:
- glanzmann's thrombasthenia - aggregation function - when platelets connect with fibrin ; AR
	- ==deficiency of GIIb/IIIa= **fibrinogen receptor**== on the platelet membrane
	- symptoms consistent with a defect in primary hemostasis - **epistaxis**
	- therefore it's a ==disorder of platelet aggregation,== 
	- ==sees neonatal period, bleeding can be SEVERE!!! everywhere.== 
	- TREAT: normal platelet transfusion
	- Lab testing - **BLEEDING TIME prolonged**, everything else normal. (PT/PTT) ; no aggregation to anything but **ristocetin**
- storage pool deficiencies - secretion issues, platelets adhering will release factors to call other platelets- recall platelets have 4 types of granules
		- alpha granules - 50 per platelet, pf-4, vWF, coag factor V etc. 
		- dense / delta granules - 6 per platelet, ADP/ATP/Ca/serotonin
		- lysosomes 
		- microperoxisomes 
	- gray platelet syndrome - lack of **alpha granules** - huge gray platelets - slightly dec platelet counts - autosomal fashion - ***just know its called alpha granule def - gray platelet syndrome*** bleeding mild-mod, transfusion rarely needed,  qualitative defect even tho there's mild thrombocytopenia 
	- chediak-higashi syndrome -  partial albinism, giant lysosomes, susceptible to pyogenic infections  = **just know this!**
[[-HRR Congenital and Acquired Immunodeficiencies I_Williams]] - %% chediak higashi syndrome - LYST gnee, lysosomal trafficking regulatory - defective lysosomal granule exocytosis, defective vesicle fusion + lysosomal function in neutrophils, macrophages, dendritics, NK , cytotoxic t cells, many other types too. albino, neuropathies, giant lysosomes in PMNs/neutrophils %%
	- hemansky-pudlak syndrome - dense granule deficiency - rare except in northwest puerto rico, albinism, poor vision, nystagmus(rapid eye movements), pulm fibrosis  - seen in kids 

acquired
- meds - aspirin - ASA - inhibits COX1 = **in normal individuals it's slight, but surg bleeding more**
- thienopyridines like clopidogrel - inhibit ADP-related platelet responses, persists 4-10 post giving
	- **bind irreversibly to ADP receptor P2y**

Combined defects (Inherited and Acquired)
inherited:
- MYH 9 mutations - uncommon, 4 related named sydndromes, so might be a spectrum 
	- thrombocytopenia
	- giant platelets
	- neutrophil inclusions "DOHLE-LIKE" bodies - remnants of RER, like 2 little spots
	- bleeding risk mild, platelet transfusion not required. 
- Bernard Soulier syndrome - "fat platelets" - adhesion issue - when platelets stick to wall - **vWF platelet receptor, GP/Ib/IX/X complex!!! deficiency**
	- giant fat platelets
	- AR, mucocutaneous bleeding in infancy and neonatal, severe enough, but most don't need routine therapy 
	- BT prolonged, PT/PTT normal 
	- AGGREGATION STUDIES: oppostie pattern of glanzmanns only able to adhere with ristocetin. 
	- TREAT: platelet transfusion 
- Wiskott-Aldrich syndome "only mention it" - x linked, microthrombocytopenia, eczema, inc susceptibility to recurrent infections etc. 
[[-HRR Congenital and Acquired Immunodeficiencies I_Williams]]
%% wiskott-aldrich - x linked recessive in WAS gene, igM low, igA + IgE high; eczema , thrombocytopenia, bleeding easily, sinopulm infections, lymphomas rise. nosebleed/bruising + sinopulm infections + eczema = triad. %%

acquired
- cirrhosis - thrombocytopenia - very common finding 
	- lower platlets less than 150k 
	- multifactorial - low platelet survival, production, splenic sequestration (30% is in spleen usually but on this type of spleen, they have huge one with many plateletS!!!)

**most common inherited coagulopathy**
Von Willebrand dz - vWD - special bc it's NOT intrinsic, but for the factor.  - **pretty much same aggregation pattern as Bernard-soulier**
- vWF protein is a binding molecule between **GP Ib receptor and collagen in subendothelial tissues at site of injury**
	- so we see derease in platelet adhesion = prolonged bleeds 
- it ALSO is a carrier protein for factor 8 - which is antihemophilic factor to increase halflife... 
	- if it doesn't bind to this, we have a smaller halflife of this, so factor 8 is deficient in vWD, causing **PTT to increase bc intrinsic pathway is depleted.**

3 categories of VWD, mostly AD except type 3 
- recall - ristocetin cofactor tests for functional VWF, and antigen tests for all **ONLY know - learning lab tests for type 1 and 3!!!** and know - multimer analysis - separation of various multimers of VWF = to get the various subtype of VWD - each has specific one
- quantitative - type 1,3
	- type 1 - most common 75%; a "partial quantitative defect" - **multimers expressed, but lighter**
		- PT, PTT(might be high), Platelet count normal 
		- factor 8, VWF antigen, ristocetin cofactor low
		- ristocetin induced aggregation low to normal 
		- TREAT: with DDAVP - desmopressin - elevates plasma lvls factor 8 and vWF by 80%, increase lasts 6-12 hrs , **basically push out some of the vWF since you have some that were nonfunctional replace with functional**
	- type 3 - 5% , most severe ; AR - "almost looks like hemophilia A" - **nearly no multimers expressed**
		- PT and platelet count normal 
		- PTT super high 
		- factor 8 less than 10%
		- VWF antigen and ristocetin cofactor is undetectable
		- ristocetin induced platelet aggregation = very low
		- TREAT: there's no VWF to begin with so you need **cryoprecipitate and some Factor 8 concentrates**
- qualitative defects 
	- 20% VWD, type 2 - **half and half of the multimer ladder**
	- TREAT with - cryoprecipitate - which contains VWF, source of fibrinogen usually  
all types of VWD - presenting w ez bruising, epistaxis, excessive bleeding after trauma/surg, know
- **hemarthroses are RARE**

acquired
- splenomegaly - sequestering all these platelets, more than 30-40%, might lower platelet counts by a lot 
- thrombocytopenia due to large spleens usually mild to moderate. rarely <20k 
	- HIV + SLE 


![[1b. Bleeding Disorders III-Disorders of Secondary Homeostasis_Squires_NOTES (1).pdf]]

Summary slide: 
 It is important to be able to determine the possible coagulation factor deficiency based on the PT and PTT results 
 Further, based on the interpretation of the PT and PTT, be able to construct a differential diagnosis 
 Some of the most important coagulopathies include:
 - Hemophilia A, B, C 
	 -  Hemophilia A and Type 3 vWD would generally show severe bleeding and both would demonstrate a _prolonged aPTT._
	 - 
 - While less common, the various inhibitors (autoantibody and alloantibody to factor VIII and Lupus inhibitor, are also important)
 Fibrinolysis is an important condition that may result in severe bleeding abnormalities - what causes that? dic/fibrinolytic bleeding and all that surgery that causes it 

Secondary hemostasis -  mainly clotting factors - the platelet plug formation, this time with the fibrin plug lol 
PT and PTTs are both huge for secondary hemostasis 
- ↑PT; Normal PTT - means that the intrinsic and common are okay, so the factor 7 might have an abnormality ... note - the PT more sensitive than PTT - note that factors 10,5,2,1 might be mild. 
- differential - 7 or mildly abnormal common coagulation pathway -> look into a mixing study!
	- if it corrects:
		- inherited factor 7 def - AR, very rare
		- inherited mild def of II, V, X, I. very rare too
		- liver dz - liver mild to moderate causes prolonged PT bc of decreased syntheiss
		- vita K def - **remember this is a cofactor in synthesizing 2,7,9,10** (malnourishment)
		- ==warfarin - a vita K antagonist. usually causes prolonged PT==, but in more severe cases of OD, both 
	- if it doesn't correct - inhibitor
		- inhibitor of factor 7, or 2,5,10. very rare.

- Normal PT; ↑PTT - 12,11,9,8 - before the mixing study - always ask: **are they on heparin?**
	- ==**huge note - only heparin measured by PTT**==
- does correct? - think factor def, HMWK/prekallekrein, or vWD (bc it's a factor 8 thing, causing a factor 8 diminishment)
	- note - 12, prekallekrein and HMWK - **don't cause bleeding**
	- in males - 8 and 9 are common def! 
	- 11 deficiencies = are very rare. except in Ashkenazi Jews! 
	- deficiencies: hemophilia A,B,C,, vWB dz, heparin 
- not correct - think inhibitor most commonly lupus inhib, autoantibody to 7, or autoantibody to 8/9. ; autoantibodies in pts *treated* for hemophilia A or B 

	- Hemophilia A, B, C 
		- Hemophilia A - factor 8 deficiency - inherited, x linked
			- easy bruisability
			- hemarthroses, soft tissue hematomas, GI/GU bleeds 
			- **PETECHIAE are ABSENT!**
			- can be in various levels of severity depending on how much the factor 8 is. female carriers are normal, about 50% of normal 
			- spontaneous mutations are up to 30% of cases, happens in males sometimes. 
			- mild-moderate - use DDAVP (stimulates factor 8 + vWF release), factor 8 concentrates 
		- hemophilia B - factor 9 deficiency - "christmas dz" = x linked, symptoms are same as hemophilia A
			- **only diff is that we have a PROLONGED PTT**
			- we have specific factor 9 concentrates
		- hemophilia C - factor 11 deficiency  - rare , AR except only in ashkenazi jewish population 
			- treatment: no concentrate. only frozen plasma 

	- Inhibitors 
		- inhibitors to SINGLE coag factors- typically IgG antibodies, 
			- some autoantibodies for factor 8 and vWF most common -> **acquired hemophilia A and vWD**
				- they just chill and *spontaneously* develop autoantibodies to specific coagulation factors , **50% have no recognizable illness** and reminder associated with autoimmune dz or pregnancy
				- rare - **acquired hemophilia** - perhaps more common in elderly... risk of hemorrhage is **SEVERE**!
					- TREAT: with factor 8 concentrates, but might respond to immunosuppression, and 3/4 pregnant pts might regress and then just respond to corticosteroids
			- alloantibodies (antibodies developped to antigens you DON't have) - to factor 7 or 9 can happen in patients WITH hemophilia A/b, who are treated with commercial concentrates of 8 and 9
				- basically they get these factors infused and might develop antibodies
				- TREAT: maybe get a concentrate from another manufactor. or give factor 7a etc. 
		- antiphospholipid antibodies - inlude anti-cardiolipin antibodies + lupus anticoagulant cause prolonged PTT, but only rarely associated with bleeding, **associated with thromboembolic events/miscarriage**
			- lupus anticoagulants - what we need to know
				- IgG or IgM
				- increase PTT but **no increase of bleeding ; but thrombosis instead + increased risk of miscarriage be4 10 weeks**
				- **most ppl who get it don't have autoimmune diseases!**

- ↑PT; ↑PTT - can be
	- factor deficiencies - common pathway - 1,2,5,10
	- multiple def - liber dz, vita K def
	- dilutional coagulopathy with a huge transfusion without plasma 
	- inhibitors - 2,5,10 all very rare... or direct thrombin inhibitors 
	- DIC - disseminated intravascular coagulation - in pts with prolonged TT or decreased fibrinogen. poz D-dimer 
what if they have a strong clinical hx of bleeding but them everything's normal PT/PTT???
- specific platelet studies and tests for vWD
- factor 13 needs to be assessed; separate from PT/PTT crosslinks fibrin molecules for more clot stability- rare but severe is associated with : umbilical bleeding , delayed bleeding from trauma, intracranial bleeds, pregnancy loss. 

low fibrinogen - hypofibrinogenemia - severe liver dz
DIC - consumption of fibrinogen via thrombin/plasmin
high vol fluid replacement with no plasma/cryprecipitate supps
testing - most sensitive/specific test is Thrombin time 
- 

dysfibrinogenemia - 
- very rare - structurally abnormal fibrinogen usually inherited -,  acquired form associated with biliary tract or severe liver dz
	- mainly asymptomatic , but some major bleeding thrombosis 
	- note - TT primary screening test

Fibrinolysis - basically that plug gets ripped up 
activators + inhibitors - don't have to know what these are just know it's critical to regulation 
- bleeding due to abnormalities in fibrinolytic system - manifest as mild - severe **delayed** bleeding post trauma!!!
- excessive wound hematomas + bruising etc. 
- can be inherited or aquired. 
more important - kinds of syndromes that might cause Fibrinolytic bleeding - cardiopulm bypass, surgeries etc. 
testing - not too important, just test when u see that delayed onset bleeding , testing for both activator and inhibitors. 

bleeding disorders 4 
![[1c. Bleeding Disorders IV-Special Cases and Summary_Squires_NOTES.pdf]]

focus on several common but complex disorders 
then have a framework at the end. focus on stuff in the table
DIC - disseminated intravascular coagulation 
- at site of vascular injury, a clot is made - in general this is meant to be confined bc everywhere downstream they inhibit coag factors
- antithrombin bound to endothelial surface always to do that -> inhibit thrombin, 10, 9, 11
- protein C inhibits 5 and 8 
	- major increase in release of activating factors -> thruout the system - DIC start!
it's always secondary to an underlying condition that activates coagulation
- severe infection - 35% cases of severe spesis
- malignancy - procoagulant factors of tumor cells
- trauma - release of tissue factor
- obstetrical complications like placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism that causes leakage of TF
- less frequently - vascular malformation, immune rxns, heat stroke/hepatic necrosis 
basically - you get so many little clots vascular occlusion leading to ischemic tissue dmg, and bc of the consumption of clotting stuff you bleed like crazy ; shistocytes = RBCs dmg'd from fitting thru occluded vessels 
thrombosis activates plasmin and then fibrinolysis happens -> fibrin split products => bleeding + ischemic dmg !!!
- acute renal failure is super common + major organ dysfunction all due to ischemia 
TESTING:: schistocytes, PT, PTT , TT up, platelet count+fibrinogen down, sky high D-dimer. 
TREAT: - the underlying dz, hard to stop DIC except supportive therapies like mechanical ventilation and blood, also some questionable therapies like heparin/Protein C 

TTP - thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - 
- this is abnormality in vWF!!! cleaved by ADAMTS-13 proteinase into smaller pieces, but this does not happen here!!
- fundamentally - **hyaline thrombi in capillaries and small arterioles** - leading to thrombocytopenia from consumption and RBC destruction microangiopathic hemolysis 
- massive vWF - **high affinity to platelets - we get so much aggregation**
	- thrombocytopenia - seen in most, due to ppl consuming all the platelets to make thrombi
	- anemia + schistocytes; hgb 8-9 due to the damage. 
	- fever 
	- neurological symptoms 
	- renal dz 
happens in 3 categories
- congenital - ADAMTS13 hereditary deficiency, many mutations, AR, most are heterozygous but still severely deficient
- idiopathic TTP - acquired due to autoantibodies to ADAMTS-13 , female mostly 
- non-idiopathic TTP - due to meds, malignancies, pregnancy 
TREAT: **fresh frozen plasma exchange** - aphaeresis - replaces the ADAMTS-13 is ... over 80% survive when treated with plasma exchange. 

Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS!!!
- microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 
- bloody diarrhea
- acute renal failure
seen in kids follows **e. coli O157:H7 which makes shiga like toxin** 
- shiga like toxin absorbed into plasma, binds to glomerular endothelial cells -> platelet activation + aggregation similar to TTP!!


bleeding in pregnancy - only ITP has real risk for baby 
- gestational thrombocytopenia - like 7% are <150k platelets in otherwise healthy women
	- don't freak out its normal and usually due to dilution plasma increases [[-HRR Maternal CV TBL]]
- ITP - they need therapy, lower than the gestational thrombocytopenia 
	- 32% of moms need corticosteroids of ivig 
	- major concern = fetal platelet count, of <20k ... fetal loss seen 
- preeclampsia - proteinuria + htn , plateletcounts can be reduced but rarely below 50k
	- babies born not at risk
	- [[-SFP Pregnancy and Plancenta_Butler]]
- hellp - can occur independently of preeclampsia but can happen as it evolves
	- nausea, malaise, abd pain and platelets <100k and elevated liver enzymes
	- babies born not at risk 
	- [[-HRR Maternal CV TBL]]
25% nicu babies = episode of bleeding and 11% are major. 
preterm have higher incidence

need to know just for rotations - 
- pT/pTT/fibrinogen etc = all have different range from adults 
- prolonged ptt/pt = **due to decreased coag factors in neonate...**
	- basically even with normal platelet counts, the platelets are hypofunctional
- in spite of that - **compensated by more vWF, hematocrit, lower protein C/S and lower antithrombin**

bleeding disorders in neonates
- NAIT - neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia - in the transfusion lectures, due to IgG maternal antibody to platelet specific antigen on fetus platelets 
- vitamin K def = coag 2, 7, 9,10 = in liver needs y-carboxylation of these... and vitamin K induces this
	- prolonged pt/ptt!!! 
	- early = onset 24 hrs of birth due to maternal meds
	- classically 1-7 days after birth due to poor feeding
	- late 1-8 wks = due to fat malabsorption 
	- they're given it after birth 
- trauma = major causes of bleeding - post traumatic hemorrhage
	- direct injury to BV 
	- trauma-induced coagulopathy = development TIC of this is bleeding NOT associated with the site of direct injury, seen in 40% of deaths 
		- cause of it - a lethal triad: hemodilution, acidosis, hypothermia 
		- hemodilution - use of only rbcs in resuscitation diluting platelets and coagulation factors + large volume of crystalloids 
		- acidosis - certain med, sedation, lactate due to tissue injury 
		- hypothermia - infusion of cold fluids like blood, shock (traumatic brain injury = loss of function to regulate temp)
