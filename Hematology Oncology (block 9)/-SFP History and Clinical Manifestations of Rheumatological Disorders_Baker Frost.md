ARTHRITIS differences 
associated with inflammatory dz
- prolonged stiffness after rest (30+ minutes)
- stiffness imrpoved w/ use
- warmth, erythema, loss of function + swelling 
- symtpoms of systemic dz, something more widespread

non-inflammatory 
- brief stiffness after rest (gel phenomenon)
- pain worsened w use 
- early - joint effusion
- later - bony enlargement , replacement of joint with this bones
- loss of function 

temporal pattern
- migratory - gonococcal arthritis, rheumatic fever
- additive , joints added in the process with no resolution - RA, psoriatic arthritis, SLE
- episodic - gout, pseudogout, palendromic rheumatism 
quantitiative
- polyarticular - 4+ joints, RA, SLE, RA variant of psoriatic arthritis
- oligoarticular <4 joints, **seronegative spondyloarthropathies** [[-SFP Autoimmune Diseases I+II_Baker Frost]]- 
- monoarticular - septic arthritis or gout 
distribution
- symmetric - RA , SLE
- asymmetric - osteoarthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathies 

rheumatic ROS - weight loss, fever, rash, hair loss, eye inflammation, dry mucosa, SOB, acid reflux(esp in scleroderma), oral/nasal ulceration, proximal muscle weakness, pleuritic chest pain, hematuria/dysuria, joint pain/swelling, raynaud phenomenon

osteoarthritis - "wear and tear" still there's a bit of inflammatory responses
- degenerative joint disease - DJD  , **NONSYMMETRIC** destruction + regen of joints and bones ; we see **cartilage fragmenting and narrowing w/ bony overgrowth afterwards** + outer areas of it we see inflammatory mediators
- most common cause of disability 
- age and trauma related; <30 min of morning stiffness with gel phenomenon, typically worse with use, like at night 
- joint swelling (**cool** feeling in spite of effusion), limited movement/range, tenderness, **crepitus/crunchy sensation with movement** + osteophytes 
- several forms
	- nodal = hands
		- DIPs = heberden nodes- tip of finger be4 nail, hard and this is bony overgrowth.  
		- PIPs = bouchard's nodes - one middle joint below the dip, hard and this is bony overgrowth.  
		- first CMC joint = base of thumb, can see squaring of the thumb base,  hard and this is bony overgrowth.  
	- isolated = weight bearing joint like knees 
	- also in the spine, hips (has a way of grading it 1-3) , midfoot/ankle
	- also obesity is a risk factor for development nad progression ; weight loss dec pain + work load on joints ... but if this narrowing already takes place, **weight loss only helps with pain management** 
	- in the xtray below: JSN = joint space narrowing, seen in bright white! JSN worsens and gets more narrow with time in asymmetric wear!![[nodal arthritis.png]]
- **we SEE JOINT SPACE LOSS, asymmetric wear in the xray with bony overgrowth!**

rheumatoid arthritis - chronic inflammatory 
- synovium has a lot of hypertrophy, inflammatory cells will be going into the cartilage and erode the bones
- multifocal, **symmetrical**, **MULTIPLE small joints and swelling** - both wrists and ankles etc; additive, polyarticular 
	- joints excluded from this definition: CMC joint (more in osteo) , and MTP joint- gout + osteo
- morning stiffness, hours to loosen up 
- fever + fatigue sometimes. 
- early DX: handshake/squeeze test at MCP (leads up to fingers) and then MTP joints (toes with foot bones) with squeeze  
- subq nodules + **non-reducible deformiteis in later stages** bc erosions in synovial spaces took place 
	- hyperflexion of the PIP joints , where erosions happen, and then pulling of the lateral bands , which leads to deformities, even after it. "boutonniere deformity"
	- swan neck deformity - DIP flexion, PIP extension 
- swelling of PIPs = **looks like bouchard's nodes,** but NOT bony overgrowth, they are squishy!!!
- eye inflammation + interstitial lung dz ; we see holes poking thru the sclera 
---
gout - exquisitely tender nad painful 
- very abrupt + acute, often at night, which is typically due to monosodium urate crystals precipitating from colder temps in synovial fluid -> **a lot leads to tophi, similar to calcionosis but different**
- **3-10 days episodic flare time**
- 75% first attacks in the first MTP joint ; red and swollen + sooo much pain ): 
- initial attacks = **monoarticular but can become poly and more frequent**; 
- tophi = **whiteish in color similar to calcionosis like in scleroderma** ; also similar to bouchards nodes and heberden nodes, but not as hard. depositions seen in the joints! **linear crystal structures!**
	- these crystals will activate the TLRs, innate immune system, making **IL-1 beta**, which leads to inflammatory response in gout!!!
- gout on XRAY: soft tissue swelling on edges + destruction on joint, **"RAT BITE erosion, like a bite mark with an overhang"**, different from RA erosion 
- DX: fewer amt of joints involved, urate in blood, typhis ; can either img urate depo or tap it to look at the crystals

spondyloarthropathies - [[-SFP Autoimmune Diseases I+II_Baker Frost]] = **enthesis - where the tendon attaches to the heel - achilles** , think of seronegative, also sacroillitis  
- ankylosing spondylitis
	- enthesis
	- morning BACK stiffness that loosens with activity 45+ min; this is diff from mechanical back pain that worsens with actiivty 
	- eye pain anterior uveitis + photophobia
	- famhx HLA B27
	- TESTS to DX: 
		- diminished ability to reverse lumbar lordosis = SCHOBER test 
			- measure at top of sacroiliac crest and then fULL flex forward. normal inc is 3.5-5 cm with flexion but someone with this can't , **lower inc**
		- inability to touch occiput to wall bc of sacroiliac joint + lumbar spines fusion - we get more and more hunched over, can't stand straight up ): 
		- tenderness of sacroiliac joints - we do a **FABER** test, flexion, abduction, external hip rotation all cause pain. basically iliac compression causes this pain too  
	- can see joint space, but not as discrete, more **fluffy overall** - 
	- **bamboo spine - very hollow, straight, loss of curve**
- enteropathic arthritis
- psoriatic arthritis - might overlap with some others, hard to DX 
	- arthritis can precede rash in 20%  cases 
	- DIP joints, dactylitis (sausage digits uniform swelling + inflammation)/**enthesitis, where tendons and ligaments attach to bones,** 
	- spondylitis 
	- oligoarthritis, but might present with rheumatoid presentation 
	- different swelling than nodes
	- common t see = nails look weird ,theres NAIL PITTING = greater of pits you have, **more risk of developing it** 
- reactive arthritis 
	- triad: asymmetric oligoarthritis, conjunctivitis, urethritis, but not common for these to all happen at same time 
	- urogenital or intestinal infection causes it 
	- rash sometimes ; **keratoderma blenorrhagicum, dry, scaly itchy rash on soles of feet!**
	- enthesitis can also happen anyways
