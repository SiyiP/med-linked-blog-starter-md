![[Immune Vasculitis I and II_Pasham_PPT (1).pdf]]

notes about this  - probably don't have to know 2nd line therapies 
==immune mediated vasculitis== 
==for the most part - first line is TREATMENT: corticosteroids== 

==vasculitis - heterogenous grp of disorders based on blood vessel inflammation with necrosis== and clinically a diverse set of signs and symptoms 

mechanisms - all tissues have vessels, can target anything 
- ==immune mediated like lupus== 
- ==fungal infections/other infectious orgs from direct vascular invasion, aspergillious and stuff === 
	- they can also precipitate immune mediated vasculitis like thru cross rxns or immune complex formation. 
	- always rule this out before giving immunosuppression for immune mediated stuff 
- ==other: rad, trauma, toxins== 

classification 
- large vessels = A 
- Medium vessels = B
- small Vessels 

==![[vasculitis size groups.png]]==
- large vessel vasculitities = takayasu + giant cell arteritis
- medium vessels affect vessels at organs 
- anca-associated small vessel vasculitis - 
- immune complex stuff etc 

different skin layers = more used to choose what biopsy to choose? 
![[skin biopsy levels.png]]


==large vessel vasculitis - think aorta== 
---
- ==chronic granulomatous arteritis, we'll see giant cells in all of these== in ppl!!!!
1. ==young , <50 = takayasu== 
	- more ==female, younger asian female>male== 
	- 10-30 yrs , classically **aorta + the branching arteries**
	- ==pulseless dz = upper exremity claudication, you feel no pulse! + htn, carotidynia, dizziness, visual abnormalities==
	- ==DX: **angiography is good = conventional + MRI**== high index of suspicion - bowel pain with claudication, CVA, MI, renovasc htn, absent/dec pulses in extremities, systemic symptoms + ESR up, **low albumin, high globulin** , 
		- ==we see characteristic narrowing of white on xray.== 
	- histo looks different, with the same types of giant cells 
	- TREAT: 1 mg/kg/day prednisone with gradual taper
		- ESR is not always suppressed, so not a good guide 
	- ==they have some continuation with vessel stenosis in spite of therapy ): might need some surgery ... otherwise good prognosis== 
2. ==50+ in ppl with giant cell arteritis== 
	- aka temporal arteritis / cranial arteritis, women > men 
	- ==we see large thickening of **temporal arteries classically, also in vertebral arteries, opthalamic and posterior ciliary arteries**==
		- we see a ==thick cord temporal artery cord== in the patient, on the side of their head. that's where you should biopsy 
		- ==thickened intima on histo, and then we see **giant cell = with elastin cords, eating up the elastica of the vessel!**==
	- less common = internal/ext carotids, central retinal, subclavian etc. 
	- ==insidious onset: insidious, perm **blindness**, fatigue, anorexia, fever, **polymyalgia rheumatica** - many areas of joint pain== 
		- ==ESR + CRP elevated== 
		- ==anemia of chronic dz== 
	- ==abrupt onset: headaches, unilateral, scalp tenderness,== 
		- ==visually: diplopia, ptosis, transient or perm blindness, ischemic optic neuritis with pallor / edema of optic disk== 
		- ==tongue hang or jaw claudition/hang== 
	- DX: temporal artery biopsy and vascular ultrasound to help guide that!! 
		- aside, ==don't wait for the biopsy results just start steroids and don't delay treatment.== 
		- might be poz for up to 2 weeks of steroid therapy 
	- TREAT: 40-60mg prednisone, inc IV dose if visual loss, reduce dose by 10% every 2 wks... 
		- follow symptoms + ESR/CRP too 
		- might slow down, stop or reverse taper if ESR rises / symptoms return 
		- ==do well but treated cases remit in 1-2 years.== 
	- steroid sparing agents = methotrexate, tocilizumab (anti-il6R monoclonal antibody )

==medium vessel vasculitis==
---
1. ==polyarteritis nodosa - necrotizing arteritis without Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome== 
	- any age affected, ==mainly male>female, peak age 50-60 yrs==
	- ==hep b association!==!! questions might give you q stem with other hep b-associated diseases! 
	- ==insidious onset==
		- ==nonspecific - weight loss, fever, arthralgias==
		- ==peripheral sensory neuropathy== bc these nerves are also destroyed 
	- ==abrupt onset -== 
		- ==palpable purpura, new onset htn with renal artery involvement - red patches with slight bump== 
		- ==intestinal ischemia, abd pain + bloody in stool== 
		- ==**mononeuritis mutliplex** - nerves not working,== loss of them!!! ==this is classically a wrist drop! many nerves affected bc of vasculature, **so the distribution of nerves aren't rlly making sense in terms of grouping**==
		- ==livedo reticularis - beaming patterns, white and red microhemorrhage patterns, circles everywhere==
		- ==splinter hemorrhages + digital gangrene==(looks red + some stuff)
		- testicular pain
		- ==**lungs are fine suprisingly; they're spared**== 
	- pathologically - ==**necrotizing inflammation will extend thru the vessel wall -> HEAL INTO FIBROSIS -> into the perivascular tissue, inflammatory aneurysms develop**==
		- if you heal into fibrosis, it canot handle the pulsatile nature of blood = ==we get blood pouching out with the "healed part of the wall" = **pseudo aneurysm** bc fibrotic tissue can't handle the pulsatile nature of blood==
		- seen dramatically, with ==white circular thickening and strong random white dots of blood on the angiogram, beads.== 
		- there's a danger there. - healed process can't contain the blood flow, might rupture and cause hemorrhage everywhere
	- ==DX: biopsy if skin involved, but target the organ while avoiding kidney biopsy== 
		- ESR
		- hep b sero
		- angiography 
	- ==TREAT: death in 1-2 yrs, but prednisone 1 mg, and give pulse dose of iv pred if fulminant.== 2nd line ? - 
2. ==kawasaki dz - necrotizing arteritis with MCLN syndrome== 
	- aka ==mucocutaneous lymph node dz = meaning conjunctiva involved==, soetimes you have ==lymphadenopathy - we see some red inflammation around mouth mucous membrane== 
		- ==also desquamation in it, came up in **desquamated rASH/peeling skin**==
	- acute fetal illness of infancy + early childhood 
	- ==antiendothelial antibodies==
	- ==self limited, but **can cause vasculitis of coronary a and lead to MI in a kid!**==
	- ==**TREAT: iv immunoglobulins + aspirin to reduce CV** sequelae bc of risk of CAD and MI== 
	- coronary artery aneurysms -> MI and death 

==small vessel vasculitis==
---
- ==all have the petechial hemorrhage dots picture, happening everywhere== 
- ==palpable purpura/petechia = more associated in small vessel vasculitis! similar to polyarteritis nodosa== 
- ==anca associated==
	- ==antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies== = bc of some trigger, ur body made these , and these would ==hyperactivate neutrophils, which then cause them to mediate a vasculitic attack to small capillarities==
	- ==glomerulonephritis== picture ==bc of that attack on small capillaries!!== 
	- ==P-anca = **perinuclear = MPO association**==
	- ==C-ANCA = cytoplasmic, 90% is due to proteinase 3... PR3== 
	- must confirm these with antigen specific pr3 and mpo tests
==![[p anca vs c anca.png]]==
c-anca on the left, and then the perinuclear ones on the right "hug" the neutrophil lobes 
	==1. granulomatosis with polyangitis==
		==- 30-50 yr old, male female 1:1== 
		**- more in caucasian groups, ==c-ANCA and PR3 poz in 85% of these cases!**== 
		==- upper resp tract, "**saddle nose" deformity!!!**== 
		- ==tracheal stenosis, mass lesions that are invasive, so **many ENT symptoms**== like otitis media, proptosis, sinusitis, and some Lower resp nodular lesions + ==**cavitary lesions (mimic TB)**==
		==- insidious until suddenly you get **pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis**==  
		- some skin + ocular manifestations, ==**unilateral one eye popping out** possibly==
		==- elastin highlights black part of vessel - shows **discontinuity in elastin of the vessels**==
		==- granulomas + giant cells can form in GPA, diff from large cell vasculitises bc ANCA poz, renal involvement, and lower resp tract== 
		==- TREAT: high mortality ): initial immunosuppressive of prednisone, then cyclophosphamide or rituximab IV ;;; **maintenance immunosuppression after achieving remission** ;== 
		==**- pneumocystis carinii / jiroveci pneumonia prophalyxis** bc of care to lungs!== 
	==2. MPA - microscopic polyangiitis== 
		==- renal + lung heavy involvement!!!!==
		- similar to GPA, but ==does NOT have upper resp tract involvement== 
		==**- P-ANCA is poz most of the time**==
		==- necrotizing vasculitis in small vessels with little to no immune depos== 
		==- necrotizing glomerulonephritis + pulm capillaritis== 
		==- hyperacute = rapidly prog glomerulonephritis, pulm hemorrhage==
		- ==insidious = intermittent constitutional symptms, purpura, mild renal + hemoptysis sometimes== 
		==- **SEGMENTAL necrosis = same crecsent as GPA**==
		- ==more **HEMORRHAGIC PICTURE**== - ==no cavitary lesions nor are there a lot of giant cells ....== hemorrahgic in CXRAY is more fuzzy or fluffy 
		- TREAT: steroids + cyclophosphamide  if need
	==3. eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EGPA== 
		==- insidious prodrome:== 
			==- **allergic prodrome , with ASTHMA adult onset!!!**==
			==- eosinophilic pneumonia + gasteroenteritis==
		- prodrome may abate with vasculitis onset 
		==**- ANCA+ MPO P anca mainly**== 
		==there can be a neuro involvement with peripheral neuropathy== 
		- but in ==vasculitis phase there's mainly a pulm dz, fleeting but lobar, interstitial, and nodular patterns on xray== 
		- sometimes we see ==pulm hemorrhage **without renal dz**== 
		==- poor outcome with azotemia, **CNS involvement,** cardio , proteinuria + GI involvement unless treated== 

---
- ==non-anca-associated==
	1. ==IGA vasculitis== 
		- HSP , ==palpable purpura in **children**, 50% less than 5 yrs ; slight bumpiness to it== 
		- ==igA depo on histopath== 
		- ==leukocytoclastic vasculitis + arthritis + abd pain+ skin lesions== 
		- ==**igA nephropathy and igA vasculitis look exactly the same. it's just that IgA vasculitis doesnt *HAVE* to involve the kidney**==
		- where does igA deposit? just realize that IgA vasculitis can be renal, but igA nephropathy is renal-limited 
		- ==better prognosis in kids, spontaneously resolves.== but in ==adults and older kids, 10-30% go to chronic renal dz and end stage renal failure== 
		- TREAT: no controlled studies, but success with early corticosteroids if renal involved. 
	2. ==hypersensitivity vasculitis - small vessel cutaneous vasculitis==
		- similar pic to above , just has more association with ==serum sickness and drug rxns : fever, arthralgia, malaise==
		- ==distinguished by **IgG deposition**==
		- ==can also be in older ppl== 
		- often: ==abrupt onset of rash, **arthus rxn or type 3 hypersensitivity, = immune complex mediated** papular eruption more in dependent areas, discrete or coalescent lesions== 
		- TREAT: remove offender + give steroids 

3. ==Behcet disease = outside the box, ulcerations + HLA-B51== 
	- ==systemic vasculitis = involving vessels of all sizes on both arteries + venous sides; pulm + neuro has large morbidity== 
	- has ==pathergy - smallest trauma can result in abnormal ulcerations , similar to pyoderma gangrenosum== 
	- more ==freq seen in jp, ME, and mediterranean region== 
	- ==usually young adults 20-40, men== 
	- ==**oral + genital ulcers for years!!!!**==
		- recurrent oral thing , painful- many lesions 
		- buccal mucosa on gingiva, lips tongue
	- ==followed by ocular + neuro manifestations== 
		- ==blindness, anterior uveitis, some conjunctivitis too== 
		- ==hypopyon iritis = eye fill with pus== 
	- other cutaneous lesions 
		- erythema nodosum , pyoderma gangrenosum
		- acneiform lesions, and 
		- pustular lesions = including pathergy lesion - **if you puncture their skin sterily they still get a pustular lesion = this is called a pathergy phenomenon**
	- ==involving all diff areas of body including arthritis, seizures, HA, GI== 
	- ==relapsing + remitting course with more aggressive in men== 
	- HLA-B51 association 
	- DIFFERENTIALS: IBD, SLE, Reactive arthritis, herpetic infections = **all ulcer causing things**
	- TREAT: steroids 
	- systemic = more steroids 

4. ==Thromboangiitis obliterans -= buerger's disease==
	- ==male smokers = age 25-50== 
	- ==HLA association==
	- ==vasculitis + thromobosis== of ==MEDIUM vessels==
	- ==israel, jp, india== 
	- ==raynaud's phenomenon, vascular insufficiency, pain , chronic ulcerations== 
	- see ==very intense vascular occlusions== 
	- pathology - we see ==complete fibrinoid completely sealing off the vessel - autoamputation of finger tips!== 
	- ==TREAT: stop smoking==
