![[Immune Vasculitis I and II_Pasham_PPT (1).pdf]]
notes about this  - probably don't have to know 2nd line therapies 
immune mediated vasculitis 
for the most part - first line is TREATMENT: corticosteroids 

vasculitis - heterogenous grp of disorders based on blood vessel inflammation with necrosis and clinically a diverse set of signs and symptoms 

mechanisms - all tissues have vessels, can target anything 
- immune mediated like lupus 
- fungal infections/other infectious orgs from direct vascular invasion, aspergillious and stuff = 
	- they can also precipitate immune mediated vasculitis like thru cross rxns or immune complex formation. 
	- always rule this out before giving immunosuppression for immune mediated stuff 
- other: rad, trauma, toxins 

classification 
- large vessels = A 
- Medium vessels = B
- small Vessels 

![[Screenshot 2025-07-29 at 5.24.52 PM.png]]
- large vessel vasculitities = takayasu + giant cell arteritis
- medium vessels affect vessels at organs 
- anca-associated small vessel vasculitis - 
- immune complex stuff etc 

different skin layers = more used to choose what biopsy to choose?

large vessel vasculitis - think aorta 
---
- chronic granulomatous arteritis in ppl!!!!
- young , <50 = takayasu 
	- more female, younger asian female>male 
	- 10-30 yrs , classically **aorta + the branching arteries**
	- pulseless dz = upper exremity claudication, you feel no pulse! + htn, carotidynia, dizziness, visual abnormalities 
	- DX: **angiography is good = conventional + MRI** high index of suspicion - bowel pain with claudication, CVA, MI, renovasc htn, absent/dec pulses in extremities, systemic symptoms + ESR up, **low albumin, high globulin** , 
		- we see characteristic narrowing of white. 
	- histo looks different, with the same types of giant cells 
	- TREAT: 1 mg/kg/day prednisone with gradual taper
		- ESR is not always suppressed, so not a good guide 
	- they have some continuation with vessel stenosis in spite of therapy ): might need some surgery ... otherwise good prognosis 
- 50+ in ppl with giant cell arteritis 
	- aka temporal arteritis / cranial arteritis, women > men 
	- we see large thickening of **temporal arteries classically, also in vertebral arteries, opthalamic and posterior ciliary arteries**
		- we see a thick cord temporal artery cord in the patient, on the side of their head. that's where you should biopsy 
		- thickened intima on histo, and then we see **giant cell = with elastin cords, eating up the elastica of the vessel!**
	- less common = internal/ext carotids, central retinal, subclavian etc. 
	- insidious onset: insidious, perm blindness, fatigue, anorexia, fever, **polymyalgia rheumatica** - many areas of joint pain 
		- ESR + CRP elevated 
		- anemia of chronic dz 
	- abrupt onset: headaches, unilateral, scalp tenderness, 
		- visually: diplopia, ptosis, transient or perm blindness, ischemic optic neuritis with pallor / edema of optic disk 
		- tongue hang or jaw claudition/hang 
	- DX: temporal artery biopsy and vascular ultrasound to help guide that!! 
		- aside, don't wait for the biopsy results just start steroids and don't delay treatment. 
		- might be poz for up to 2 weeks of steroid therapy 
	- TREAT: 40-60mg prednisone, inc IV dose if visual loss, reduce dose by 10% every 2 wks... 
		- follow symptoms + ESR/CRP too 
		- might slow down, stop or reverse taper if ESR rises / symptoms return 
		- do well but treated cases remit in 1-2 years. 
	- steroid sparing agents = methotrexate, tocilizumab (anti-il6R monoclonal antibody )

medium vessel vasculitis
---
- polyarteritis nodosa - necrotizing arteritis without Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome 
	- any age affected, mainly male>female, peak age 50-60 yrs
	- hep b association!!! questions might give you q stem with other hep b-associated diseases! 
	- insidious onset
		- nonspecific - weight loss, fever, arthralgias
		- peripheral sensory neuropathy bc these nerves are also destroyed 
	- abrupt onset - 
		- palpable purpura, new onset htn with renal artery involvement - red patches with slight bump 
		- intestinal ischemia, abd pain + bloody in stool 
		- **mononeuritis mutliplex** - nerves not working, loss of them!!! this is classically a wrist drop! many nerves affected bc of vasculature, **so the distribution of nerves aren't rlly making sense in terms of grouping**
		- livedo reticularis - beaming patterns, white and red microhemorrhage patterns, circles everywhere
		- splinter hemorrhages + digital gangrene(looks red + some stuff)
		- testicular pain
		- **lungs are fine suprisingly** 
	- pathologically - **necrotizing inflammation will extend thru the vessel wall -> HEAL INTO FIBROSIS -> into the perivascular tissue, inflammatory aneurysms develop**
		- if you heal into fibrosis, it canot handle the pulsatile nature of blood = we get blood pouching out with the "healed part of the wall" = **pseudo aneurysm**
		- seen dramatically, with white circular thickening and strong random white dots of blood on the angiogram. 
		- there's a danger there. - healed process can't contain the blood flow, might rupture and cause hemorrhage everywhere
	- DX: biopsy if skin involved, but target the organ while avoiding kidney biopsy 
		- ESR
		- hep b sero
		- angiography 
	- TREAT: death in 1-2 yrs, but prednisone 1 mg, and give pulse dose of iv pred if fulminant. 2nd line ? - 
- kawasaki dz - necrotizing arteritis with MCLN syndrome 
	- aka mucocutaneous lymph node dz = meaning conjunctiva involved, soetimes you have lymphadenopathy 
	- acute fetal illness of infancy + early childhood 
	- antiendothelial antibodies
	- self limitied, but **can cause vasculitis of coronary a and lead to MI in a kid! **
