![[Immune Vasculitis I and II_Pasham_PPT (1).pdf]]

notes about this  - probably don't have to know 2nd line therapies 
immune mediated vasculitis 
for the most part - first line is TREATMENT: corticosteroids 

vasculitis - heterogenous grp of disorders based on blood vessel inflammation with necrosis and clinically a diverse set of signs and symptoms 

mechanisms - all tissues have vessels, can target anything 
- immune mediated like lupus 
- fungal infections/other infectious orgs from direct vascular invasion, aspergillious and stuff = 
	- they can also precipitate immune mediated vasculitis like thru cross rxns or immune complex formation. 
	- always rule this out before giving immunosuppression for immune mediated stuff 
- other: rad, trauma, toxins 

classification 
- large vessels = A 
- Medium vessels = B
- small Vessels 

![[vasculitis size groups.png]]
- large vessel vasculitities = takayasu + giant cell arteritis
- medium vessels affect vessels at organs 
- anca-associated small vessel vasculitis - 
- immune complex stuff etc 

different skin layers = more used to choose what biopsy to choose? 
![[skin biopsy levels.png]]


large vessel vasculitis - think aorta 
---
- chronic granulomatous arteritis in ppl!!!!
1. young , <50 = takayasu 
	- more female, younger asian female>male 
	- 10-30 yrs , classically **aorta + the branching arteries**
	- pulseless dz = upper exremity claudication, you feel no pulse! + htn, carotidynia, dizziness, visual abnormalities 
	- DX: **angiography is good = conventional + MRI** high index of suspicion - bowel pain with claudication, CVA, MI, renovasc htn, absent/dec pulses in extremities, systemic symptoms + ESR up, **low albumin, high globulin** , 
		- we see characteristic narrowing of white. 
	- histo looks different, with the same types of giant cells 
	- TREAT: 1 mg/kg/day prednisone with gradual taper
		- ESR is not always suppressed, so not a good guide 
	- they have some continuation with vessel stenosis in spite of therapy ): might need some surgery ... otherwise good prognosis 
2. 50+ in ppl with giant cell arteritis 
	- aka temporal arteritis / cranial arteritis, women > men 
	- we see large thickening of **temporal arteries classically, also in vertebral arteries, opthalamic and posterior ciliary arteries**
		- we see a thick cord temporal artery cord in the patient, on the side of their head. that's where you should biopsy 
		- thickened intima on histo, and then we see **giant cell = with elastin cords, eating up the elastica of the vessel!**
	- less common = internal/ext carotids, central retinal, subclavian etc. 
	- insidious onset: insidious, perm **blindness**, fatigue, anorexia, fever, **polymyalgia rheumatica** - many areas of joint pain 
		- ESR + CRP elevated 
		- anemia of chronic dz 
	- abrupt onset: headaches, unilateral, scalp tenderness, 
		- visually: diplopia, ptosis, transient or perm blindness, ischemic optic neuritis with pallor / edema of optic disk 
		- tongue hang or jaw claudition/hang 
	- DX: temporal artery biopsy and vascular ultrasound to help guide that!! 
		- aside, don't wait for the biopsy results just start steroids and don't delay treatment. 
		- might be poz for up to 2 weeks of steroid therapy 
	- TREAT: 40-60mg prednisone, inc IV dose if visual loss, reduce dose by 10% every 2 wks... 
		- follow symptoms + ESR/CRP too 
		- might slow down, stop or reverse taper if ESR rises / symptoms return 
		- do well but treated cases remit in 1-2 years. 
	- steroid sparing agents = methotrexate, tocilizumab (anti-il6R monoclonal antibody )

medium vessel vasculitis
---
1. polyarteritis nodosa - necrotizing arteritis without Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome 
	- any age affected, mainly male>female, peak age 50-60 yrs
	- hep b association!!! questions might give you q stem with other hep b-associated diseases! 
	- insidious onset
		- nonspecific - weight loss, fever, arthralgias
		- peripheral sensory neuropathy bc these nerves are also destroyed 
	- abrupt onset - 
		- palpable purpura, new onset htn with renal artery involvement - red patches with slight bump 
		- intestinal ischemia, abd pain + bloody in stool 
		- **mononeuritis mutliplex** - nerves not working, loss of them!!! this is classically a wrist drop! many nerves affected bc of vasculature, **so the distribution of nerves aren't rlly making sense in terms of grouping**
		- livedo reticularis - beaming patterns, white and red microhemorrhage patterns, circles everywhere
		- splinter hemorrhages + digital gangrene(looks red + some stuff)
		- testicular pain
		- **lungs are fine suprisingly** 
	- pathologically - **necrotizing inflammation will extend thru the vessel wall -> HEAL INTO FIBROSIS -> into the perivascular tissue, inflammatory aneurysms develop**
		- if you heal into fibrosis, it canot handle the pulsatile nature of blood = we get blood pouching out with the "healed part of the wall" = **pseudo aneurysm**
		- seen dramatically, with white circular thickening and strong random white dots of blood on the angiogram. 
		- there's a danger there. - healed process can't contain the blood flow, might rupture and cause hemorrhage everywhere
	- DX: biopsy if skin involved, but target the organ while avoiding kidney biopsy 
		- ESR
		- hep b sero
		- angiography 
	- TREAT: death in 1-2 yrs, but prednisone 1 mg, and give pulse dose of iv pred if fulminant. 2nd line ? - 
2. kawasaki dz - necrotizing arteritis with MCLN syndrome 
	- aka mucocutaneous lymph node dz = meaning conjunctiva involved, soetimes you have lymphadenopathy - we see some red inflammation around mouth mucous membrane 
		- also desquamation in it, came up in **desquamated rASH**
	- acute fetal illness of infancy + early childhood 
	- antiendothelial antibodies
	- self limited, but **can cause vasculitis of coronary a and lead to MI in a kid!**
	- **TREAT: iv immunoglobulins + aspirin to reduce CV** sequelae 
	- coronary artery aneurysms -> MI and death 

small vessel vasculitis
---
- all have the petechial hemorrhage dots picture, happening everywhere 
- palpable purpura/petechia = more associated in small vessel vasculitis! similar to polyarteritis nodosa 
- anca associated
	- antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies = bc of some trigger, ur body made these , and these would hyperactivate neutrophils, which then cause them to mediate a vasculitic attack to small capillarities
	- glomerulonephritis picture bc of that attack on small cpaillaries!! 
	- P-anca = **perinuclear = MPO association**
	- C-ANCA = cytoplasmic, 90% is due to proteinase 3... PR3 
	- must confirm these with antigen specific pr3 and mpo tests
![[p anca vs c anca.png]]
c-anca on the left, and then the perinuclear ones on the right "hug" the neutrophil lobes 
	1. granulomatosis with polyangitis
		- 30-50 yr old, male female 1:1 
		**- more in caucasian groups, c-ANCA and PR3 poz in 85% of these cases!** 
		- upper resp tract, "**saddle nose" deformity!!!** 
		- tracheal stenosis, mass lesions that are invasive, so **many ENT symptoms** like otitis media, proptosis, sinusitis, and some Lower resp nodular lesions + **cavitary lesions (mimic TB)**
		- insidious until suddenly you get **pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis**  
		- some skin + ocular manifestations, **unilateral one eye popping out** possibly
		- elastin highlights black part of vessel - shows **discontinuity in elastin of the vessels**
		- granulomas + giant cells can form in GPA, distinguish from large cell vasculitises with ANCA poz, renal involvement, and lower resp tract 
		- TREAT: high mortality ): initial immunosuppressive of prednisone, then cyclophosphamide or rituximab IV ;;; **maintenance immunosuppression after achieving remission** ; 
		**- pneumocystis carinii / jiroveci pneumonia prophalyxis** bc of care to lungs! 
		- 
	2. MPA - microscopic polyangiitis 
		- renal + lung heavy involvement!!!!
		- similar to GPA, but does NOT have upper resp tract involvement 
		**- P-ANCA is poz most of the time**
		- necrotizing vasculitis in small vessels with little to no immune depos 
		- necrotizing glomerulonephritis + pulm capillaritis 
		- hyperacute = rapidly prog glomerulonephritis, pulm hemorrhage
		- insidious = intermittent constitutional symptms, purpura, mild renal + hemoptysis sometimes 
		- **SEGMENTAL necrosis = same cresent as GPA**
		- more **HEMORRHAGIC PICTURE** - not a huge amount of cavitary lesions nor are there a lot of giant cells .... hemorrahgic in CXRAY is more fuzzy or fluffy 
		- TREAT: steroids + cyclophosphamide  if need
	3. eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EGPA 
		- insidious prodrome: 
			- **allergic prodrome , with ASTHMA adult onset!!!**
			- eosinophilic pneumonia + gasteroenteritis
		- prodrome may abate with vasculitis onset 
		**- ANCA+ MPO P anca mainly** 
		there can be a neuro involvement with peripheral neuropathy 
		- but in vasculitis phase there's mainly a pulm dz, fleeting but lobar, interstitial, and nodular patterns on xray 
		- sometimes we see pulm hemorrhage **without renal dz** 
		- poor out come with azotemia, **CNS involvement,** cardio , proteinuria + GI involvement unless treated 

---
- non-anca-associated
	1. IGA vasculitis 
		- HSP , palpable purpura in **children**, 50% less than 5 yrs ; slight bumpiness to it 
		- igA depo on histopath 
		- leukocytoclastic vasculitis + arthritis + abd pain+ skin lesions 
		- **igA nephropathy and igA vasculitis look exactly the same. it's just that IgA vasculitis doesnt HAVE to involve the kidney**
		- where does igA deposit? just realize that IgA vasculitis can be renal, but igA nephropathy is renal-limited 
		- better prognosis in kids, spontaneously resolves. but in adults and older kids, 10-30% go to chronic renal dz and end stage renal failure 
		- TREAT: no controlled studies, but success with early corticosteroids if renal involved. 
	2. hypersensitivity vasculitis - small vessel cutaneous vasculitis
		- similar pic to above , just has more association with serum sickness and drug rxns : fever, arthralgia, malaise
		- distinguished by **IgG deposition**
		- can also be in older ppl 
		- often: abrupt onset of rash, **arthus rxn or type 3 hypersensitivity, = COMPLEMENT** papular eruption more in dependent areas, discrete or coalescent lesions 
		- TREAT: remove offender + give steroids 

3. Behcet disease = outside the box 
	- systemic vasculitis = involving vessels of all sizes on both arteries + venous sides; pulm + neuro has large morbidity 
	- has pathergy - smallest trauma can result in abnormal ulcerations , similar to pyoderma gangrenosum 
	- more freq seen in jp, ME, and mediterranean region 
	- usually young adults 20-40, men 
	- **oral + genital ulcers for years!!!!**
		- recurrent oral thing , painful- many lesions 
		- buccal mucosa on gingiva, lips tongue
	- followed by ocular + neuro manifestations 
		- blindness, anterior uveitis, some conjunctivitis too 
		- hypopyon iritis = eye fill with pus 
	- other cutaneous lesions 
		- erythema nodosum , pyoderma gangrenosum
		- acneiform lesions, and 
		- pustular lesions = including pathergy lesion - **if you puncture their skin sterily they still get a pustular lesion = this is called a pathergy phenomenon**
	- involving all diff areas of body including arthritis, seizures, HA, GI 
	- relapsing + remitting course with more aggressive in men 
	- HLA-B51 association 
	- DIFFERENTIALS: IBD, SLE, Reactive arthritis, herpetic infections = **all ulcer causing things**
	- TREAT: steroids 
	- systemic = more steroids 

4. Thromboangiitis obliterans -= buerger's disease
	- male smokers = age 25-50 
	- HLA association
	- vasculitis + thrmobosis of MEDIUM vessels
	- israel, jp, india 
	- raynaud's phenomenon, vascular insufficiency, pain , chronic ulcerations 
	- see very intense vascular occlusions 
	- pathology - we see complete fibrinoid completely sealing off the vessel - autoamputation of finger tips! 
	- TREAT: stop smoking
