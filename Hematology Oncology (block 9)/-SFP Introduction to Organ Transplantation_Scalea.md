a patients immune response - esp after trauma is what we treat as a doctor in terms of symptoms. with transplantation we will mod the immune system to do what we want. transplantation and immune system knowledge is huge. 

non-transplant therapies for other forms of organ failure - dialysis ): with blood filtration, takes 3 hrs in the chair , feels terrible after dialysis. p much a full time job
- trying to replace with transplantation. 

functions lost
- kidney - fluid removal, urine, we see edema + dyspnea, chest pain, SOB
- hco3- reabsorption, acid/base fuckery 
- K+ elim
- erythropoietic prod = low o2 content
- renin + pge prod
livers - dramatic, proteins absent in bloodstream, hard to clear stuff 
pancreas = insulin, glucagon PP, somatostatin, hco3- 

order of kidney failure transplant = how long been on dialysis; heavy need of this! many ppl on the waiting list!!! 
liver failure = based on how sick you are 

procedure - multi artery kidney transplantation 
- manage of all the connections - blood comes in, blood comes out etc. 
liver transplantation - ruq, very large quadrant 
- orthotopic operation - same place as native organ, remove that old one and place in the new one 
kidney transplant 
- **heterotopic** - **the kidney goes into the pelvis instead of the native position** 
pancreas transplant
- midline incision, retract the intestines up, and then sew pancreas to the common iliac a + vena cava 
heart and lung - bronchial anastomosis 

**every** organ generates an immune response when there's genetic disparity between donor + recipient - we measure that by looking at HLA profile 
liver = less immune reactive than < kidney < heart 

transplant immunology - what mechanism does **alloreactive/rejection** occur? 

>[!he will pimp us by asking:] 
**TELL ME HOW THE REJECTION PROCESS works**
> - t cell mediated b cell response = primary mechanism 
> 1. antigen presentation; blood goes into the organ, donor has to touch the recipient to see when that occurs. APCs of the **recipient** will enter that organ to directly intract with donor!!! 
> 	1. direct pathway = donor APC has HLA/peptide complex presented to the TCR of the T cells in recipient 
> 	2. indirect pathway - APC comes from recipient presents donor antigen to their own T cells  
> 	3. semidirect pathway - endocytosis of donor HLA within the APC that comes from the recipient, so HLA peptide complex is from the donor, but recipient APC presents to recipient T cells 
> 2. TCR binding - with T helper cell activation, binding that antigen in the context of mhc , now bound to TCR of that T cell 
> 3.  from t cell binding, we have costimulation - to regulate and support that interaction. we can learn how to manipulate these costim channels to overcome or sensitize or gain tolerance to this 
> 4. clonal proliferation of t cell via IL-2 -> Th1 => acute rejection .... making of t cells more!!!
> 5. B cell activation, via t cells binding the MHC on the b cell, activating it. 
> 6. antibody production by the B cells = antibodies direct towards antigen of the donor that was recognized by the t cells 
> 7. ab-mediated complement activation pathway -

rejection - what we try to combat are t-cell mediated b cell rejection 
- hyperacute rejection = when all the bullets are ALREADY out of the gun. minutes to hours; **non-treatable and pre-formed antibody**. very uncommon here
	- dx via visual + labs. on the table it turns dark purple and black. this is a crossmatch test
- acute rejection = happens any time past the transplant like within the year.... 
	- generates an acute response. t cell or antibody mediated - frequently treatable 
	- dx via labs + biospy 
- chronic rejection = less understood + talked about, usually with scarring + histo changes ; slow inflammatory changes 
	- can affect 100% of kidney recipients by 10 yrs
	- dx - labs + biopsy 

transplant drugs - has different classes 3 categories
- induction therapy - 
	- t cell depletion - stop the first step, maintain the low level of activity  
	- t cell blocking 
	- b cell depletions 
	- steroid 
- maintenance therapy - 
	- calcineurin inhibitor = workhorse agent for transplant rejection 
		- **most important drug to know: tacrolimus** - maintenance immunosuppression 
		- most important drug for rejection prevention!!! this changed the world in terms of transplants 
	- antimetabolites
	- steroids
	- costimulatory blockade
	- mTOR inhibitors 
- salvage therapy - 
	- steroids
	- t cell agents
	- b cell agents
