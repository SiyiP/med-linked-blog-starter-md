use lab tests to eval wbc
benign cases of leukocytosis/penia
diff dx of benign lymphadenopathy based on histology 

CBC / diff 
- WBC = total number f wbc 
- wbc differentials. - reported in both relative percentages and absolute values (K/uL)
a lot of these indices use flow cytometry and software to analyze these. these will also make peripheral blood smear slides 
- if you order a wbc diff, it might already be there as part of the process
wbcs
- neutrophils - 60% differential, phagocytosis, very short lived 1 day in blood, 5 days in tissues lifespan
- lymphocytes 30% b cells make antibods, t cells regulate, NK cells innate immunity, longer lived wks-yrs
- monocytes - 5% - phagocytosis + antigen presentation and shortlived hrs - days lifespan
- eosinophils - 2-3%, degranulating and making cytokines, 1-1.5 wks lifespan
- basophils - 1%, these are very dark granulated (nucleus obstructed) + chunky, releases histamines, hrs-days lifespan 

bone marrow biopsy - eval hematopoiesis as a source
- posterior iliac crest is seen 
- - first component - aspirate the liquid marrow components
- 2nd  - core biopsy, taking the calcified bone and intervening non bone structures
less preferable is sternal aspirate only biopsy - if posterior iliac crest isn't seen - only in emergent setttings 
wbc development 
- focusing on white cell maturaiton - all these arise from same lymphoid stem cell (remain in bone marrow for shorter while, then ) -> lymphocytes - (t cells mature in the thymus, b cells mature in lymph nodes)
- myeloid stem cells = everything other than lymphocytes. 

leukocytosis - numerical inc in wbc count 
- inc due to normal immune response or a neoplastic bone disorder 
leukopenia - def of wbc 
- production failure or accelerated destruction 
- classified by degree of severity 
- inadequate granulopoiesis - decreased granulocyte prod in marrow - hypoplasia
	- aplastic anemia - 
	- external suppression by drug 
	- **myelodysplastic syndrome - a lot of production, but doesn't make it into circulation bc ineffective maturation**
