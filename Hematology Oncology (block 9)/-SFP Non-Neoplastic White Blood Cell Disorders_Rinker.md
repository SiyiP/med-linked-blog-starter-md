use lab tests to eval wbc
benign cases of leukocytosis/penia
diff dx of benign lymphadenopathy based on histology 

CBC / diff 
- WBC = total number f wbc 
- wbc differentials. - reported in both relative percentages and absolute values (K/uL)
a lot of these indices use flow cytometry and software to analyze these. these will also make peripheral blood smear slides 
- if you order a wbc diff, it might already be there as part of the process
wbcs
- neutrophils - 60% differential, phagocytosis, very short lived 1 day in blood, 5 days in tissues lifespan
- lymphocytes 30% b cells make antibods, t cells regulate, NK cells innate immunity, longer lived wks-yrs
- monocytes - 5% - phagocytosis + antigen presentation and shortlived hrs - days lifespan
- eosinophils - 2-3%, degranulating and making cytokines, 1-1.5 wks lifespan
- basophils - 1%, these are very dark granulated (nucleus obstructed) + chunky, releases histamines, hrs-days lifespan 

bone marrow biopsy - eval hematopoiesis as a source
- posterior iliac crest is seen 
- first component - aspirate the liquid marrow components
- 2nd  - core biopsy, taking the calcified bone and intervening non bone structures
less preferable is sternal aspirate only biopsy - if posterior iliac crest isn't seen - only in emergent settings 

wbc development 
- focusing on white cell maturation - all these arise from same lymphoid stem cell (remain in bone marrow for shorter while, then ) -> lymphocytes - (t cells mature in the thymus, b cells mature in lymph nodes)
- myeloid stem cells = everything other than lymphocytes. 

leukocytosis - numerical inc in wbc count 
- inc due to normal immune response or a neoplastic bone disorder 
	- accelerated immune activation - primary issue is not in the bone marrow in that case 
	- infection
	- enlarged spleen 
leukopenia - def of wbc 
- production failure or accelerated destruction 
- classified by degree of severity 
- inadequate granulopoiesis - decreased granulocyte prod in marrow - hypoplasia
	- aplastic anemia - 
	- external suppression by drug 
	- **myelodysplastic syndrome - a lot of production, but doesn't make it into circulation bc ineffective maturation** 

cyclic neutropenia- regular fluctuations in number of neutrophils in peripheral blood, like 21 day freq
- ELANE gene, Autosomal dom
- we see opportunistic infections with fever, oral mucosal ulcers, resp infections
- TREAT: regular blood count monitoring, prevention of infections, **G-CSF granulocyte colony stimulating factor** also pt education so they can track when they're most vulnerable

lymphopenia - less common than neutropenia, 
- mild decrease doesn't have as high of a risk of infections - but mainly viral
- acquired - **HIV/AIDs + COVID** - earlier signs of ppl who have covid is decreased lymphocyte counts
- congenital - severe combined immunodef- SCID affects both b and t cells [[-MMT Nucleotide Metabolism I+II_Dalton]] [[Chunking - Inborn Genetic Disorders]]
- digeorge - microdel in chromosome 22 - thymic aplasia  [[Chunking - Inborn Genetic Disorders]]

what is a "left shift?"
- inc in preportion of immature cells or granulocytes!!! button for immautre is on the left
- peripheral blood- 
	- normal - almost all granulocytes - mature neutrophils with some bands
	- granulocytic left shift - inc in bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes 
- bone marrow - normal is full spec of maturation , fewest "blasts"
	- left shift - inc proportion of less mature

neutrophilia
- leukemoid rxn - mostly neutrophils, mild left shift w inc band forms
	- benign normal physiologic bone marrow response to some kind of stress! which will release many granulocytes and neutrophils into the blod
	- reactive cell changes = toxic granulation, dohle bodies [[-SFP Bleeding Disorders I-IV Overview, 1 and 2dary hemostasis_Squires]]
	- top out <50 k/uL - we see rare nucleated rbcs too 
- leukoerythroblastic response
	- also a granulocytic left shift, but with **fuller spectrum of myeloid maturation, with higher nucleated RBCS!!!!**
	- seen with some massive trauma or replacement of bone marrow or hemolytic anemia = indicates bone marrow stress
	- <50 k/uL still 
- chronic myeloid leukemia - neoplastic left shift disorder of myeloid maturation
	- even more showing of myelocytes/promyelocytes with more basophilia
	- rare nuc RBCs, and often 50+ k/uL way higher and younger!

reactive benign leukocytosis 
- neutrophillia - can be caused by iatrogenic means like steroids (stimulating neutrophil release into blood), steroids **decrease neutrophil adhesion molecules, preventing them from migrating into tissues** + G-CSF
	- bacterial infections - stress, toxic granulation, dohle bods, cytoplasmic vacuoles
- eosinophilia - mainly type 1 hypersensitivity rxns, like mast cells etc - other causes are parasitic and drug rxns + hematopoietic malignancies
- basophilia - fewer benign causes - most often think a neoplastic process
- **monocytosis - travels with neutrophilias, seen in chronic infections + autoimmune** 
- lymphocytosis - mainly viral infections 
	- infectious mononucleosis - these are caused by EBV or CMV- an increase in lymphocytes; **virus replicates inside pharyngeal epithelial cells then in b cells** , which are stimulated which will then **make CD8 t cells funky and weird as they circulate in blood**
	- spread thru saliva, common in youth ; these lymphocytes CD8+ t cells look huge 
	- fever, malaise, night sweats, dysphagia, lymphadenopathy and toncilitis, also splenomegaly
		- **biggest thing - splenic rupture so ppl need to avoid contact sports**
	- DX: monospot test - ids heterophile antibodies made in response to EBV. 
	- TREAT: supportive care 

reacitive/atypical lymphocytosis 
- reactive benign mature lymphocytes - heterogenous/clumped chromatin 
- lower nuc:cyt ratio
- ballerina skirting - irregular cytoplasmic membrane "fried egg". no nucleoli
blasts - smooth, open, homogenous chromatin. 
- high nuc:cyt ratio bc less cytoplasm 
- nucleoli seen prominently 
- hour rod - seen in cytoplasm, an abnormal finding. 
- smooth chromatin !!! velvet-looking 

lymph node pathology 
normal lymph node. - filter + processing of foreign particles - immune response is made
- cortex = the b cells (can be primary of 2ndary. 2ndary = has germinal center pale middle, where b cells mixed with **follicular dendritic cells FDC**)
	- b cells stay in that spherical germinal center. 
	- macrophages will clean up the lymphocytes that don't make it = why germinal centers might appear polarized. dark zone and light zone 
	- proliferative more mitotically active = dark zone and less so is in the light zone 
		- these will go to mantle zone, just outside f the germinal center for their maturation. 
		- then go into the germinal center to finish maturation. then leave. 
	- primary follicles - **mantle zone b cells, no germinal center yet.**
- interfollicular = t cells
- medulla - mostly t cells 

folicular hyperplasia - b cell prolif , follicles no longer limited to cortex, multiplying in number no longer jsut inthe cortex but spreading
- intact mantle zones + marginal zones 
- have a lot of macrophages in the center. 
- associated - rheumatoid arthritis, syphillis, hiv 

interfollicular/paracortical hyperplasia - **t cell prolif, since they live in between b cell nodes,** expanded interfollicular/paracortical areas
- intact follicles but spaced **far apart**
- associated w viral infections, post-vaccination, drug rxns, dermatopathic lymphadenitis - skin irritation. 
- pigment deposition would dump the fluid draining from chronic skin irritation to this site. 

sinusoidal hyperplasia - expanded sinuses + most often histiocytes(macrophages/dendritic cells)- lots of pale pink cytoplasm and irregularly shaped cells
- this pattern - wide variety of causes, draining in lymph node cancer sites
- langerhans cell histiocytosis, 
- rosai-dorfman disease - histiocyte enlargmeent, looks like they're engulfing other blood cells - **fully entact nondestroyed rbcs instead of debris**

mixed pattern - granulomas where we might get pink necrosis in the middle 
- non-necrotizing granulomas - sarcoidosis + nonspecific rxn to malignancy 
- necrotizing ganulomas - fungal, tb, cat scratch dz 
	- ==cat scratch - caused by bartonella henselae - g-negative==
	- stellate or serpentine necrotizing granulomas with central neutrophils !!
	- regional lymphadenopathy - most common in kids, 2-4 mon spontaneous rec 

hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. - MAS macrophage activation syndrome - can be lethal
- abnormal rxn to viral or proinflammatory exposure - **huge cytokines -> phagocytosis of normal blood cells!** = widespread inflammation + organ failure. 
- defect in - **CD8+ and NK cells. can be caused by t cell neoplasms, defects or Xlinked lymphoproliferative disorder XLLPD**
nonspecific symptoms - fever splenomegaly pancytopenia rapidly progressing to DIC/organ failure!
- DX: bone marrow shows hemophagocutosis, high ferritin, hypertriglycerides, high soluble IL-2 receptor
- TREAT: underlying cause 

ancillary/supportive testing for wbc abnormalities - 
- lymph node biopsy is also important + extra stains 
- - on core biospies and flow cytoometry 
- special stains - require specimin on a slide like air dried smears - directly binding into that stain  
- immunohistochemical stains - **using antigen antibody rxn to make this, requires paraffin embbeded tissue on a slide** 
	common for there to be a brown color with that thing of interest and pale blue in the bgd is counter stain 

flow cytometry - **need fresh tissue/fluid! using lasers**

cytogenetic studies
- FISH - fluorescence in situ hybridization - looks for specific genetic abnormalities
PCR + microarray + next gen sequencing
