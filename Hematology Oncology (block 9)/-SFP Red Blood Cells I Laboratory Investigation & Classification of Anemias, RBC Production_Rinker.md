first lesson lowkey a review... 
RBC prod - all from rbcs, and all the pluripotent cells either commit to myeloid or lymphoid (lymphocytes)
myeloid to pronormoblasts then all the way to erythrocyte ! 

in bone marrow to look at rbcs - thyey mature in clusters/islands - aggregates of islands of cells with round very dark nuclei 
- these are paraffin embedded sections 
also smear it wright giemsa stain - round nuclei metachromatic cytoplasm seen - aspirate - maturing rbcs 
most common - peripheral blood smears - see the fully mature rbcs
- biconcave disc, full of hb, 6-8 um, 
- nucleated rbc, reticulocyte, newly formed that still has rna, special stain req 
- polychrmatic form = reticulocyte, retianed rna -> blue / purple 
- when we have anemia, bone marrow knows that we need to make more. when that happens, younger rbcs get released early. **higher rna content + more purple/blue = this is polychromasia, mixture of diff colors**
	- further distinguish it with stain methylene blue, a reticulum clumped material 
	- anemic patient with **appropriate compensation - more reticulocytes in the blood increases**

most iron associated w/ hb , HbA. = adult hb , 2 alpha globin + 2 beta ; amount of types vary based on stage of dev
- we switch from hbF to HbA - hereditary persistance of hbF - binds o2 tighter than HbA = this is a left shift in the curve, 
- recall - hb coorperativity sigmoidal shape. 
- right shift - decrease o2 affinity, more release and more "delivery" - caused by pH acidosis, inc 2,3 DPG, inc in temp
- left shift - binding more tightly, less delivery, high pH alkalosis, less 2,3 dpg, less temp, methemoglobinemia, carboxyhemoglobinemia (met hb and carboxy hb)
met hb - decreased o2 carrying capacity of hb - conversion of iron from reduced state to fe3+ state instead, ferric iron unable to bind/transport oxygen 
- basically acquired = more common, exposure to oxidizing agents of hb like nitrates 
- congenital - defect in cyt b5 reductase , mutations in globin protein too 
- signs and symptoms - chocolate brown blood, **hypoxemia refractory to supp o2**. dyspnea, anxiety, light-headedness, confusion, tachy, etc. 
	- risk for acidosis, coma, death
- TREAT: remove agent, methylene blue injection reducing agent + the supplemental oxygen 
- you put pulse ox on their finger = falsely elevated bc met hb absorbs light at same rate as normal hb 

hb clearance - primary storage of iron is ferritin - good for immediate use
bilirubin - geriatric or prematurely destroyed rbcs. 
unconjugated - not water soluble , conjugated by glucoronydul transferase 
haptoglobin - binds free heme for elimination processed thru macrophages in bone marrow, spleen, liver


anemia - pallor, pale mucous membranes, SOB, some are asymptomatic due to compensation! 
CBC- most common lab - will do concentration of wbc + platelets + rbc indices 
- ordered w differential - 
- rbc count - concentration of rbcs mil/uL
- hb - concentration of hgb g/dL; lysed and burst cells. light transmission measurements. 
- hematocrit - relative volume of packed rbcs %; basically the centrifugation of these 
- mean cell vol MCV = avg size of rbcs fL 
- MCH - mean cell hb - avg amt of hgb in each RBC in pg
- MCHC concntration - avg amt hb per certain concentration of rbs
- red cell distrib wideth RDW - amoutn of variability, higher is more variability % 

microcytic - small rbcs, mcv low
normocytic - norm mcv
macrocytic large mcv high
hypochromia - low decreased hb in rbcs, mchc basically, central pallor > 1/3 , basically more of the clear zone. 
anisocytosis - variation in cell size rdw
poikilocytosis - variation in shape
polychromasia - bluish color in some cells bc of rna in reticulocytes. 
spur cells - acanthocytes - very spiking 
ethinocytes - spikey but less pronounced spines 
teardrops - pointed edge 
sickle cells -drapanocytes
helmet cellls - sheared off border
horn cells - peripheral cutouts
schistocytes - small angulated points, small pieces

anemia classification - can be based on mcv  - 
can also classify based on reticulocyte count (hypoproliferatives(leukemias, aplastic anemias, pure rbc aplasia) vs hyperproliferatives (hemorrhage, hemolytic anemias))
also based on underylying mechanism
- blood loss
- increased destruction
- impaired production 
blood loss
acute/traumatic 
- blood loss, hyppovolemia - fluid shift
- hemodilution normochromic + normocytic; same rbcs as before remember 
- reticulocytosis - 5 days later

chronic - iron deficiency anemia is the result
- common source of gi , gyn tract issue 

![[2b. Red Blood Cells II-Hemolytic Anemias_Rinker_PPT.pdf]]

hemolytic anemias - umbrella term 
- destruction of rbcs, shorteend rbc survival, inc erythropoietin(inc rbc prod), inc bone marrow rbc production, accumulation of breakdown products like jaundice + pigment gallstones 
- intravascular - 
- extravascular - 
- mechanical trauma - like implanted devices like ECMO/heart valves; microangiopathic hemolytic anemias can be this as well: **DIC, TTP HUS**
		these are ripped aparts into schistocytes + hb + LDH 
- free hb will b bound by haptoglobin and then metabolized later. 
	- **shows helmet cells + schistocytes**
- DIC - both from widespread endothelial injury or release of thromboplastic substances
treat underlying cause 

ttp - hyaline thrombi in microcirculation - **def in adamts13 which would usually cleave vWF, making too big complexes -> platelet aggregation uncontrolled**
- can affect cns, gi, and renal. **neurologic changes common!**
- low platelets, fragmented rbcs , anemic, platelets down 
- TREAT with plasma exchange + meds 

HUS - mostly caused by e coli -> shiga like toxin, binds to and dmg glomerular endothelium , making it thrombogenic. 
- other causes are drugs, radiation therapy, etc complement abnormalities 
- bloody diarrhea, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 
- kids 

paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - PNH
- acquired memb defect secondary to acquired mutation affecting hematopoietic stem cells
- PIGA - phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor - can get acquired mutations ; CD55 and CD59 
	- normal ones have this, which protects from complement mediated lysis 
	- rbcs lacking it are more prone to complement destruction. 
- signs - episodic discolored urine; get dark + lighten up again + thrombosis 
- complement mediated - **happens in spleens not vessels. - we see spherocytes, very spherical but lose that concave shape therefore central poiwer!!!**
	- microspherocytes!!! 
	- we don't have CD59, 55, FLAER - flow cytometry to id wbcs + rbcs that lack these GPI anchor proteins ... 
	- most have some bone marrow dysfunction; over time can develop worse nad get leukemia or myeloid something  
TREAT: bone marrow transplant. can develop into aplastic anemia and/or subsequent leukemia 


glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd - 
- x linked recessive enz african (mild) and mediterranean mod/severe
	- in men all express it 
	- in women only half of all rbcs show it 
- glutathione metabolism, in normal rbcs reduced glutathione gsh protects rbcs from oxidative injury 
- deficiency = rbcs more prone to ox injury + hemolysis 
- **episodic hemolytic anemia, associated w drugs, toxins, fava beans + infections**
	- bakc pain + hemoglobinuria
	- sudden pallor, jaundice, etc. 
	- cross linking of globins -> makes **heinz bodies denatured proteins + damaged bite cells that happen with removal of heinz bodies!**
	- peripheral smear - regularly not seen heinz bodies

malaria - major cause of hemolytic anemia!!! huge issue
- four types in humans - 
	- plasmodium... falciparum
	- malariae
	- ovale
	- vivax 
- clinial symptoms
	- headaches 
	- cyclic fevers
	- joint pain
	- hemolytic anemia 
- TREAT: quinines
intracellular trophozites - ring shaped - immature 
extracellular gametocytes - banana shaped ; mature 


autoimmune hemolytic anemias 
- phagocytosis by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial systems.... 
- peripheral blood - microspherocytes; fc receptors bind to the antibodies + eat it + remove sme of the rbc membrane, which reseals into the microspherocyte 
- **direct antigobulin test - DAT/coombs test positive.** 
	- basically wash and remove the rbcs, just has the floating proteins then id with monoclonal antibodies against igg and complements 
- microspherocytes!! similar to different causes of extravascular hemolysis 
- warm rxns - antibodies igG usually react to rbcs at room temp, opsonized by autoantibodies and cleared by spleen reticuloendothelial cells - extravasc hemolysis
	- causes - idiopathic, sle, b-cell lymphomas, or drug induced. like methyldopa, penicillin, quinidine? hugee thing on immune complexes 
	- splenomegaly seen too 
- cold dz - IgM bind to rbcs at colder temps, fixing copmlement, rbcs destroyed by it 
	- idiopathic  , b-cell lymphomas, **mycoplasma or infectious mononucleosis infection**
	- reynaud phenomeon can be seen due to agglutination!!
	- IgM - big blumps of rbcs can be formed

rbc membrane defects
hereditary spherocytosis- AD!!! more fragile and more suseptible to stress . clinical stability and severeity varies 
- defect in cytoskeletal proteins 
- ankyrin, spectrin
- clinical signs - anemia, splenomegaly, jaundice, cholelithiasis
- stable course punctuated by hemolytic crises / infection, or aplastic crises like parvovirus b19
- no central pallor; mchc increases
- using the osmotic fragility test, you see they're more prone to rupture in hypotonic solution 
- TREAT: splenectomy - 
- asplenic pts - need strep pneumo vaccines - **we might also see howell jolly bodies, remnant of dna that is left there by a lack of the spleen!**

hereditary elliptocytosis- AD
- defect in spectrin, making them more elongated. 
- spectrin normally are in dimers but this is interrupted. variable severity 
- spectrinn defect + deficiency = **hereditary pyropoikilocytosis** - basically not only dimers don't form, but you also get low levels of spectrin production
	- all diff shapes of rbcs 
	- unusual thermal sensitiviy 
	- also in burn trauma seen 

![[2c. Red Blood Cells III-Hemoglobinopathies and Thalassemias_Rinker_PPT.pdf]]

abnormal hemoglobins - hemoglobinopathies are inherited, usually single aa substitution in globin chain, moderate to severe anemia
- might be sporadic in one family seen. too many variants of hbs 
recall normal hb are hbA, hbF, hbA2
- hbA - alpha 2, beta 2, most of it 
- hbF - alpha 2, gamma 2 ; 2% in adults , be increased in adults beta thalassemia or HbSS
- HbA2 - alpha 2 delta 2 , 1.5-4% of normal adult hb
	- beta thalassemia or megaloblastic anemia : increased 
	- decreased: iron def, sideroblastic anemia 

electrophoresis is used to look at hb makeup
- in basic ph, types of hb would migrate together. like A2 and C for instance 
- you need to repeat on acidic pH 
HPLC - high performance liquid chromatography - they elute from ion exchange column with different things 

hb A- > hb S - structural abnormality in hb beta chain due to point mutation - glutamate replaced by valine 
- polymerization in low o2 states
- 10% ppl of african descent, protective against malaria 
heterozygous - has sickle cell trait Hb AS - completely normal but inc risk of renal medullary carcinoma
- Hb A 60% - still A dominant, more overrepresented bc more stable 
- Hb S 40% 
- <2 HbF and 1-4 HbA2 as normal 
homozygous - sickle cll anemia Hb SS - sporatic pain, thrombosis, splenic sequestration, avascular necrosis of femoral head, precipitated by stresS: dehydration, hypoxemia, acidosis, infection
- profound hemolytic anemia
- HbS 85%+ ; does not have HbA - **has 0% of this!!!**
- you might see some hbA in that lane of electrophoresis 
membrane changes - increase adhesiveness of rbcs - > occlusions, sickling = reversibly if debris of hypoxia and polymerization is mild can reverse. but in irreversible sickle in higher state, we see 
- DX: sickling test - poz is sickling to reducing agent 
- solubility test - lysis of RBC when exposured to reducing agent 
- electrophoresis - hbSS - actually quannitative too
	peripheral blood smear - high degree anisopoikilocytosis + sickle cells + target cells
	high mag - we see howell-jolly bodies (without spleen) + sickled cells. 
		howell-jolly bodies - due to chronic occlusion of splenic cords + sinusoids by sickled rbcs, by the end of childhood we get asplenia - prone to infection by encapsulated bacteria
		**gamma gandy bodies- area of spleen with fibrosis + ca / fe deposits** - splenic hemorrhage seen - and some calcification 
- in Hb SS dz sickle cell - **hemoglobin F is protectiv ein first few months**
	- acute exacerbations managed with transfusion 
	- hydroxyurea inc hb F to protect
	- pain management + bone marrow transplant is curative. 

---
HbC; lys instead of glutamate in b-chain
- heteroxygous for the hb C trait, 50% C and 50% a 
- some target cells 
homozygous hb CC - hemoglobin C dz
- clinically asymptomatic - peripheral blood smear - numerous target cells 
- intracellular crystals - **huge chunky mass of all the precipitated hb C on one side of the rbcs**
- 90% HbC, 0% Hb A , 7% Hb F etc. 

double heterozygosity for hb S + C = Hb SC
- intermediate clinical severity between SS and CC 
- many target cells, mild sicling and 50% S 50% C

---
thalassemia - normal hb is produced but not in good quantities
a-thalassemias affected alpha - alpha globin reduction problem 
- 16 chromosome, each has 2 gene copies, so we have total of 4 gene copies
- usually due to deletions - excess unpaired chains - higher amount of deletions - more severe
	- normal - > silent carrier -> alpha thal. trait, 2 del on one gene or one on each. (mild microcytic hypochromic anemia) -> HbH dz (only one left, hemolytic anemia) -> hb Barts dz (hydrops fetalis)
		- cis alpha thalassemia trait - more common in asian
			- trans - on african populations 
			- peripheral blood smear - mild hypochromia, anisocytosis, target cells. normal or mildly decreased HbA2 
			- mainly dx of exclusion 
		- hb h disease - common in asia, low MCV, deletion of 3 chains, high affinity of o2 but not efficient for delivery, p
			- prone to oxidation + precipitation - dmg to rbcs 
			- fast moving hb 
		- Hb barts - unpaired y-globin makes hb barts
			- high affinity for o2 
			- electropheresis fast moving hb
			- fetal demise but we can help with intrauterine transfusion/bone marrow transplatn  
- newborns - excess unpaired y-globin makes y4 tetramers - hb barts
- non-newborns excess unpaired b-globin makes b4 ttramers - hb H 

b-thalassemias - affected b chain  - 
- mediterranean, africa, SE asia
- excess a-chains precipitate bc unpaired
- chromosome 11 - each chromosome has ONE copy, 2 total copies coding for b-chain 
- usually due t o point mutations + loss of heterogeneity 
	- b0 mutations = absent synthesis 
	- b+ mutations = reduced b synthesis 
	- all Hb A2 rises, and HbF increases with severity 
- minor = trait = one heterrozygous for null or + 
	- asymptomatic typically , mild/no anemia, microcytosis, RBC up 
	- peripheral blood smear - mild hypochromia, microcytosis, anisocytosis, target cells + basophilic stippling 
	- mildly elevated HbA2 
- intermedia - both + 
	- symptoms present 6-9 mon after birth after switch from F to A. 
	- nucleated rbc, target cells etc. 
- major = cooleys: one + / 0 or both null 
	- most severe - no HbA 
	- severe anemia + transfusion dependent 6-9 mon post birth 
	- anisopoikilocytosis, nucleated rbcs, basophilic stippling
	- **bone marrow expansion - we see hairly like projections, frontal bossing/prominence of forehead/eyebrow + splayed teeth**
	- hepatosplenomegaly bc of extramedullary hematopoisis 
	- iron od from freq transfusion 

ppl with combined Hb S and a-thalassemia - not as clinical severe as HbSS... 
- basically b-chain abnormality and a-chain abnormality
- better.
- **bad b-chains made have fewer a-chains to pair up with, so fewer HbS in circulation!** 
ppl with combo S and b-thalassemia 
- way worse and same as hb SS. 
- inc proportion of Hb S compaired to someone with sickle alone.
