![[2a. Red Blood Cells I-Laboratory Investigation & Classification of Anemias, RBC Production and Physiology_Rinker_PPT.pdf]]
first lesson lowkey a review... 
RBC prod - all from rbcs, and all the pluripotent cells either commit to myeloid or lymphoid (lymphocytes)
myeloid to pronormoblasts then all the way to erythrocyte ! 

in bone marrow to look at rbcs - thyey mature in clusters/islands - aggregates of islands of cells with round very dark nuclei 
- these are paraffin embedded sections 
also smear it wright giemsa stain - round nuclei metachromatic cytoplasm seen - aspirate - maturing rbcs 
most common - peripheral blood smears - see the fully mature rbcs
- biconcave disc, full of hb, 6-8 um, 
- nucleated rbc, reticulocyte, newly formed that still has rna, special stain req 
- polychrmatic form = reticulocyte, retianed rna -> blue / purple 
- when we have anemia, bone marrow knows that we need to make more. when that happens, younger rbcs get released early. **higher rna content + more purple/blue = this is polychromasia, mixture of diff colors**
	- further distinguish it with stain methylene blue, a reticulum clumped material 
	- anemic patient with **appropriate compensation - more reticulocytes in the blood increases**

most iron associated w/ hb , HbA. = adult hb , 2 alpha globin + 2 beta ; amount of types vary based on stage of dev
- we switch from hbF to HbA - hereditary persistance of hbF - binds o2 tighter than HbA = this is a left shift in the curve, 
- recall - hb coorperativity sigmoidal shape. 
- right shift - decrease o2 affinity, more release and more "delivery" - caused by pH acidosis, inc 2,3 DPG, inc in temp
- left shift - binding more tightly, less delivery, high pH alkalosis, less 2,3 dpg, less temp, methemoglobinemia, carboxyhemoglobinemia (met hb and carboxy hb)
met hb - decreased o2 carrying capacity of hb - conversion of iron from reduced state to fe3+ state instead, ferric iron unable to bind/transport oxygen 
- basically acquired = more common, exposure to oxidizing agents of hb like nitrates 
- congenital - defect in cyt b5 reductase , mutations in globin protein too 
- signs and symptoms - chocolate brown blood, **hypoxemia refractory to supp o2**. dyspnea, anxiety, light-headedness, confusion, tachy, etc. 
	- risk for acidosis, coma, death
- TREAT: remove agent, methylene blue injection reducing agent + the supplemental oxygen 
- you put pulse ox on their finger = falsely elevated bc met hb absorbs light at same rate as normal hb 

hb clearance - primary storage of iron is ferritin - good for immediate use
bilirubin - geriatric or prematurely destroyed rbcs. 
unconjugated - not water soluble , conjugated by glucoronydul transferase 
haptoglobin - binds free heme for elimination processed thru macrophages in bone marrow, spleen, liver


anemia - pallor, pale mucous membranes, SOB, some are asymptomatic due to compensation! 
CBC- most common lab - will do concentration of wbc + platelets + rbc indices 
- ordered w differential - 
- rbc count - concentration of rbcs mil/uL
- hb - concentration of hgb g/dL; lysed and burst cells. light transmission measurements. 
- hematocrit - relative volume of packed rbcs %; basically the centrifugation of these 
- mean cell vol MCV = avg size of rbcs fL 
- MCH - mean cell hb - avg amt of hgb in each RBC in pg
- MCHC concntration - avg amt hb per certain concentration of rbs
- red cell distrib width RDW - amt of variability, higher is more variability % ;

microcytic - small rbcs, mcv low
- ==Microcytic anemia include iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, sideroblastic anemia, and anemia of chronic disease.==
normocytic - norm mcv
macrocytic large mcv high
hypochromia - low decreased hb in rbcs, mchc basically, central pallor > 1/3 , basically more of the clear zone. 
anisocytosis - variation in cell size rdw
poikilocytosis - variation in shape
polychromasia - bluish color in some cells bc of rna in reticulocytes. 
spur cells - acanthocytes - very spiking 
ethinocytes - spikey but less pronounced spines 
teardrops - pointed edge 
sickle cells -drapanocytes
helmet cellls - sheared off border
horn cells - peripheral cutouts
schistocytes - small angulated points, small pieces

anemia classification - can be based on mcv  - 
can also classify based on reticulocyte count (hypoproliferatives(leukemias, aplastic anemias, pure rbc aplasia) vs hyperproliferatives (hemorrhage, hemolytic anemias))
also based on underylying mechanism
- blood loss
- increased destruction
- impaired production 
blood loss
acute/traumatic 
- blood loss, hyppovolemia - fluid shift
- hemodilution normochromic + normocytic; same rbcs as before remember 
- reticulocytosis - 5 days later

chronic - iron deficiency anemia is the result
- common source of gi , gyn tract issue 

![[2b. Red Blood Cells II-Hemolytic Anemias_Rinker_PPT.pdf]]

hemolytic anemias - umbrella term 
- destruction of rbcs, shorteend rbc survival, inc erythropoietin(inc rbc prod), inc bone marrow rbc production, accumulation of breakdown products like jaundice + pigment gallstones 
- intravascular - 
- extravascular - 
- mechanical trauma - like implanted devices like ECMO/heart valves; microangiopathic hemolytic anemias can be this as well: **DIC, TTP HUS**
		these are ripped aparts into schistocytes + hb + LDH 
- free hb will b bound by haptoglobin and then metabolized later. 
	- **shows helmet cells + schistocytes**
- DIC - both from widespread endothelial injury or release of thromboplastic substances
treat underlying cause 

ttp - hyaline thrombi in microcirculation - **def in adamts13 which would usually cleave vWF, making too big complexes -> platelet aggregation uncontrolled**
- can affect cns, gi, and renal. **neurologic changes common!**
- low platelets, fragmented rbcs , anemic, platelets down 
- TREAT with plasma exchange + meds 

HUS - mostly caused by e coli -> shiga like toxin, binds to and dmg glomerular endothelium , making it thrombogenic. 
- other causes are drugs, radiation therapy, etc complement abnormalities 
- bloody diarrhea, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 
- kids 

paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - PNH
- acquired memb defect secondary to acquired mutation affecting hematopoietic stem cells
- PIGA - phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor - can get acquired mutations ; CD55 and CD59 
	- normal ones have this, which protects from complement mediated lysis 
	- rbcs lacking it are more prone to complement destruction. 
- signs - episodic discolored urine; get dark + lighten up again + thrombosis 
- complement mediated - **happens in spleens not vessels. - we see spherocytes, very spherical but lose that concave shape therefore central poiwer!!!**
	- microspherocytes!!! 
	- we don't have CD59, 55, FLAER - flow cytometry to id wbcs + rbcs that lack these GPI anchor proteins ... 
	- most have some bone marrow dysfunction; over time can develop worse nad get leukemia or myeloid something  
TREAT: bone marrow transplant. can develop into aplastic anemia and/or subsequent leukemia 


glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd - 
- x linked recessive enz african (mild) and mediterranean mod/severe
	- in men all express it 
	- in women only half of all rbcs show it 
- glutathione metabolism, in normal rbcs reduced glutathione gsh protects rbcs from oxidative injury 
- deficiency = rbcs more prone to ox injury + hemolysis 
- **episodic hemolytic anemia, associated w drugs, toxins, fava beans + infections**
	- bakc pain + hemoglobinuria
	- sudden pallor, jaundice, etc. 
	- cross linking of globins -> makes **heinz bodies denatured proteins + damaged bite cells that happen with removal of heinz bodies!**
	- peripheral smear - regularly not seen heinz bodies

malaria - major cause of hemolytic anemia!!! huge issue
- four types in humans - 
	- plasmodium... falciparum
	- malariae
	- ovale
	- vivax 
- clinial symptoms
	- headaches 
	- cyclic fevers
	- joint pain
	- hemolytic anemia 
- TREAT: quinines
intracellular trophozites - ring shaped - immature 
extracellular gametocytes - banana shaped ; mature 


autoimmune hemolytic anemias - ==normochromic, normocytic anemia with increased spherocytes.== - can most likely be after an illness! 
- phagocytosis by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial systems.... 
- peripheral blood - microspherocytes; fc receptors bind to the antibodies + eat it + remove sme of the rbc membrane, which reseals into the microspherocyte 
- **direct antigobulin test - DAT/coombs test positive.** 
	- basically wash and remove the rbcs, just has the floating proteins then id with monoclonal antibodies against igg and complements 
- warm rxns - antibodies igG usually react to rbcs at room temp, opsonized by autoantibodies and cleared by spleen reticuloendothelial cells - extravasc hemolysis
	- causes - idiopathic, sle, b-cell lymphomas, or drug induced. like methyldopa, penicillin, quinidine? hugee thing on immune complexes 
	- splenomegaly seen too 
- cold dz - IgM bind to rbcs at colder temps, fixing copmlement, rbcs destroyed by it 
	- idiopathic  , b-cell lymphomas, **mycoplasma or infectious mononucleosis infection**
	- reynaud phenomeon can be seen due to agglutination!!
	- IgM - big blumps of rbcs can be formed

rbc membrane defects
**hereditary spherocytosis**- AD!!! more fragile and more susceptible to stress. clinical stability and severity varies 
- defect in cytoskeletal proteins 
- ankyrin, spectrin, band 3 - involving defects in these guys 
- ==clinical signs - anemia, splenomegaly, jaundice, cholelithiasis==
- stable course punctuated by hemolytic crises / infection, or aplastic crises like parvovirus b19
- no central pallor; mchc increases
- using the osmotic fragility test, you see they're more prone to rupture in hypotonic solution 
- TREAT: splenectomy , bc the spleen will remove the fragile cells.  
- asplenic pts - need strep pneumo vaccines - **we might also see howell jolly bodies, remnant of dna that is left there by a lack of the spleen!**

hereditary elliptocytosis- AD
- defect in spectrin, making them more elongated. 
- spectrin normally are in dimers but this is interrupted. variable severity 
- spectrinn defect + deficiency = **hereditary pyropoikilocytosis** - basically not only dimers don't form, but you also get low levels of spectrin production
	- all diff shapes of rbcs 
	- unusual thermal sensitiviy 
	- also in burn trauma seen 

![[2c. Red Blood Cells III-Hemoglobinopathies and Thalassemias_Rinker_PPT.pdf]]

abnormal hemoglobins - hemoglobinopathies are inherited, usually single aa substitution in globin chain, moderate to severe anemia
- might be sporadic in one family seen. too many variants of hbs 
recall normal hb are hbA, hbF, hbA2
- hbA - alpha 2, beta 2, most of it 
- hbF - alpha 2, gamma 2 ; 2% in adults , be increased in adults beta thalassemia or HbSS
- HbA2 - alpha 2 delta 2 , 1.5-4% of normal adult hb
	- beta thalassemia or megaloblastic anemia : increased 
	- decreased: iron def, sideroblastic anemia 

electrophoresis is used to look at hb makeup
- in basic ph, types of hb would migrate together. like A2 and C for instance 
- you need to repeat on acidic pH 
HPLC - high performance liquid chromatography - they elute from ion exchange column with different things 

hb A- > hb S - structural abnormality in hb beta chain due to point mutation - glutamate replaced by valine 
- polymerization in low o2 states
- 10% ppl of african descent, protective against malaria 
heterozygous - has sickle cell trait Hb AS - completely normal but inc risk of renal medullary carcinoma
- Hb A 60% - still A dominant, more overrepresented bc more stable 
- Hb S 40% 
- <2 HbF and 1-4 HbA2 as normal 
homozygous - sickle cll anemia Hb SS - sporatic pain, thrombosis, splenic sequestration, avascular necrosis of femoral head, precipitated by stresS: dehydration, hypoxemia, acidosis, infection
- profound hemolytic anemia
- HbS 85%+ ; does not have HbA - **has 0% of this!!!**
- you might see some hbA in that lane of electrophoresis 
membrane changes - increase adhesiveness of rbcs - > occlusions, sickling = reversibly if debris of hypoxia and polymerization is mild can reverse. but in irreversible sickle in higher state, we see 
- DX: sickling test - poz is sickling to reducing agent 
- solubility test - lysis of RBC when exposured to reducing agent 
- electrophoresis - hbSS - actually quanitative too
	peripheral blood smear - high degree anisopoikilocytosis + sickle cells + target cells
	high mag - we see howell-jolly bodies (without spleen) + sickled cells. 
		howell-jolly bodies - due to chronic occlusion of splenic cords + sinusoids by sickled rbcs, by the end of childhood we get asplenia - prone to infection by encapsulated bacteria
		**gamma gandy bodies- area of spleen with fibrosis + ca / fe deposits** - splenic hemorrhage seen - and some calcification 
- in Hb SS dz sickle cell - **hemoglobin F is protective in first few months**
	- acute exacerbations managed with transfusion 
	- hydroxyurea increases hb F to protect against these symptoms
	- pain management + bone marrow transplant is curative. 

---
HbC; lys instead of glutamate in b-chain
- heteroxygous for the hb C trait, 50% C and 50% a 
- some target cells 
homozygous hb CC - hemoglobin C dz
- clinically asymptomatic - peripheral blood smear - numerous target cells 
- intracellular crystals - **huge chunky mass of all the precipitated hb C on one side of the rbcs**
- 90% HbC, 0% Hb A , 7% Hb F etc. 

double heterozygosity for hb S + C = Hb SC
- intermediate clinical severity between SS and CC 
- many target cells, mild sicling and 50% S 50% C

---
thalassemia - normal hb is produced but not in good quantities; **pathologic RBC seen with it: Target cells = codocytes = due to blebbing of RBC membrane**
a-thalassemias affected alpha - alpha globin reduction problem 
- 16 chromosome, each has 2 gene copies, so we have total of 4 gene copies
- usually due to deletions - excess unpaired chains - higher amount of deletions - more severe
	- normal - > silent carrier -> alpha thal. trait, 2 del on one gene or one on each. (mild microcytic hypochromic anemia) -> HbH dz (only one left, hemolytic anemia) -> hb Barts dz (hydrops fetalis)
		- cis alpha thalassemia trait - more common in asian
			- trans - on african populations 
			- peripheral blood smear - mild hypochromia, anisocytosis, target cells. normal or mildly decreased HbA2 
			- mainly dx of exclusion 
		- hb h disease - common in asia, low MCV, deletion of 3 chains, high affinity of o2 but not efficient for delivery, p
			- prone to oxidation + precipitation - dmg to rbcs 
			- fast moving hb 
		- Hb barts - unpaired y-globin makes hb barts
			- high affinity for o2 
			- electropheresis fast moving hb
			- fetal demise but we can help with intrauterine transfusion/bone marrow transplatn  
- newborns - excess unpaired y-globin makes y4 tetramers - hb barts
- non-newborns excess unpaired b-globin makes b4 ttramers - hb H 

b-thalassemias - affected b chain  - 
- mediterranean, africa, SE asia
- excess a-chains precipitate bc unpaired
- chromosome 11 - each chromosome has ONE copy, 2 total copies coding for b-chain 
- usually due t o point mutations + loss of heterogeneity 
	- b0 mutations = absent synthesis 
	- b+ mutations = reduced b synthesis 
	- all Hb A2 rises, and HbF increases with severity 
- minor = trait = one heterrozygous for null or + 
	- asymptomatic typically , mild/no anemia, microcytosis, RBC up 
	- peripheral blood smear - mild hypochromia, microcytosis, anisocytosis, target cells + basophilic stippling 
	- mildly elevated HbA2 
- intermedia - both + 
	- symptoms present 6-9 mon after birth after switch from F to A. 
	- nucleated rbc, target cells etc. 
- major = cooleys: one + / 0 or both null 
	- most severe - no HbA 
	- severe anemia + transfusion dependent 6-9 mon post birth 
	- anisopoikilocytosis, nucleated rbcs, basophilic stippling
	- **bone marrow expansion - we see hairly like projections, frontal bossing/prominence of forehead/eyebrow + splayed teeth**
		- frontal bossing also seen in sickle cell dz 
	- hepatosplenomegaly bc of extramedullary hematopoisis 
	- iron od from freq transfusion 

ppl with combined Hb S and a-thalassemia - not as clinical severe as HbSS... 
- basically b-chain abnormality and a-chain abnormality
- better.
- **bad b-chains made have fewer a-chains to pair up with, so fewer HbS in circulation!** 
ppl with combo S and b-thalassemia 
- way worse and same as hb SS. 
- inc proportion of Hb S compaired to someone with sickle alone. 
![[2d. Red Blood Cells IV-Impaired RBC Production_Rinker_PPT.pdf]]

rbc disorders - impaired rbc prod - there's disturbances that happen at stem cell prolif and diff or disturbance of proliferaction/maturation of erythroid cells (macrocytic or microcytic)
aplastic anemia - failure of stem cells to make hematopoietic elements - peripheral blood we see cytopenias, can evolve into acute leukemias. - **marrow space looks like all fat.** - made based on how decrease their peripheral counts are as well as how cellular their marrow is in ref to a "normal person"
	idiopathic (hypothesized to be immune, primary stem cell defect)
	drugs/radiation/benzene
	post viral infections like community acquired non-A/B/C hep 
	inherited defects in DNA repair or telomerase 
		TREAT: remove offending agent + supportive care, transfusions, G-CSF, immunosuppression, bone marrow transplant? 
inherited DNA repair or telomerase 
- faconi anemia - relatively rare AR disorder caused by defects in DNA repair - might have shortness, skeletal, endocrinopathy, renal failure, **cafe au lait spots**
	- inc slid tumors, leukemia, bone marrow failure,
	- TREAT: bone marrow transplant only 
	- DX: treat the chromosomes with culture and then **treat with DNA cross linking thing - we will have a lot of breakage compared to normal**
- pure red cell aplasia - selective decrease in rbc production - subtype of aplastic, **only erythroid lineage decreased**
	- bone marrow show: defect of rbc precursors - many causes like parvovirus b19 (transient rbc aplasia),
		- diamond-blackfan anemia DBA:inherited erythroid aplasia, isolated anemia , in infancy presenting + osteosarcoma risk - **short stature, craniofacial abnormalities, triphalangeal thumbs**
	- sometimes you see viral inclusions of the nuclei. 
macrocytic anemia- **these are PAST the stem cell thing**
	- inc MCV >100 fL 
	- "megaloblastic" - these are DNA rep disorders, nutritional deficiencies like **folate and b12 deficiencies.**  ; intrinsic issue 
		- hypoproliferative anemia  - bone marrow cannot make much rbcs
		- decrease in reticulocytes + large immature rbcs in bone marrow
		- **folate + b12 => pernicious anemia**
		- symptoms of defective maturation of rbcs based on the DNA - 
			- b12 def = neurologic impairments, decreased sensation in lower extremities + demyelination - animal food sources - 
				- b12 is freed from food by pepsin, **haptocorrin protects b12 from degradation**, then pancreatic proteases split haptocorrin from b12
				- intrinsic factor binds b12, then endocytosed by ileal cells
				- in ileal, b12 binds to transcobalamin II , secreted into plasma. 
				- b12 delivered to liver for storage + other areas that need it - normal storage is 3-4 yrs 
				- most common cause - **malapsorption like pernicious anemia** or bacterial overgrowth, tapeowrms, diffuse intestinal dz like crohns 
			- **pernicious anemia - antibodies target IF and parietal cells - they have lack of intrinsic factor**
				- we see pancytopenia, neuropath, papillary atrophy of tongue, pH elevation, psychosis. 
				- DX: we see anti-parietal cells and anti-if antibodies ;; schilling test is done, given oral radioactive b12 + IM b12 -> which should pass into urine as it's absorbed by GI. urine is tested 
					- normal = high labeled b12 
					- abnormal = lower b12 meaning it **stayed in the bowel, passed into feces and not absorbed**
					- part 2 - repeat it after you give them intrinsic factor. normal reading shows pernicious anemia and abnormal still is malabsorption. 
			- folate: intake depends on diet like veggies, fruits, cereals, etc. heat labile , destroyed by cooking
				- absorbed in duodenum/jejunum, stored in liver for 3-4 mon 
				- **carbon transfer into many biochem rxns, purine synthesis to DNA synthesis**
				- most common is poor diet, decreased absorption like celiac, ibd, etc
				- or increased requirement like lactation, pregnancy etc. 
				- folate antag - methotrexate, phenytoin, ocp, trimethoprim 
			- inc destruction in marrow. 
			- CBC - decreased hb, hematocrit, rbc count, **high MCV**, +/- decreased WBC, platelets 
		- DX tests - check for deficiencies
			- b12 v folate def - measure both bc they can coexist .... if ambiguous , measure homocysteine(b12 is also here , but folate is also here. deficiency is for both to elevate. ) + *mma(ONLY B12 would convert this to succinyl coa, so this will make MMA instead in deficienc*y)
			- if folate is given when b12 is deficient - anemia may be reversed but neuro problems will persist 
		- **macrovalicytes - oval teardrop macrocytes, anisopoikilocytosis, large platelets, nucleated RBCs, large neutrophils, hypersegmented (usually 2-3+ too many ) neutrophils**
		- we have immature band giant in neutrophils 
		- bone marrow - has dysplastic changes - abnormally large RBc/WBC precursors
	- non megaloblastic - **problem OUTSIDE of the bone marrow**
		- hypo-proliferative decreased reticulocyte prod (excess alc use, liver dz lipid disorders, hypothyroidism, myelodysplasia)
		- hyper-proliferative increased reticulocyte production (hemorrhage/hemolysis)
normal/dereased - round macrocytes - no hypersegmentation on blood smear 
- bone marrow examination -> megaloblastic change -> suspect treatable 
inadequate reticulocyte response - **think thing that directly impact the bone marrow - which is megaloblastic changes, suspecting b12/folate, rbc folate stuff or primary stem problem like aplastic anemia**
if the response is adequate reticulocytes - think more peripheral destructive category 

---
- microcytic anemia -
	- iron def - poor intake/inc req, malabsorption 
		- should be top of our differential - some are asymptomatic, signs and symptms - pica, koilonychia (indentation of fingernails), angular chelitis, smooth tongue/glossitis
			- chronic blood loss most common in USA (other things are like low diet, malabsorption, inc demand... also be aware that breast milk is low in iron so you can get predisposition to this)
			- evaluate tests: 
				serum iron - iron bound to transferrin in bloood ; normal 60-170 ug/dL 
				TIBC - amount of transferrin available for binding iron, the capacity is higher. 250-370 ug/dl 
				% sat = amt of transferrin bound to iron - this is a percentage, 20-50 is normal 
				ferritin - indirect indication of iron stores, 20-200 ug/dl ; general infalmmatory marker too - if you have someone with iron def, but something else going on, it might be driving it up via a diff mechanism 
		- chronic infection/inflammation - anemia of chronic dz 
		- neoplasia - anemia of chronic dz 
		- stages of iron def anemia
			- depletion of storage iron - low ferritin, high TIBC 
			- depletion of serum iron : low iron + % saturation - bone marrow doesn't have enough iron to put into cells 
			- normocytic anemia - 
			- microcytic hypochromic anemia - variant in size .. **note - platelet count inc bc elevated erythropoietin will cross rxn with thrombopoietin receptors on megakaryocytes, bystander rxn with production up.**
	- anemia of chronic dz - ==usually mild and moderate - normocytic/microcytic== or something else - 2nd most common type of anemia, common in hospitals - 
		- note - regardless of cause, the c==ommon mechanism is *improper iron transfer with iron trapped in bone marrow macrophages*, inhibiting / suppressing erythropoiesis by cytokines hepcidin== 
			- blocking the transfer of iron from macrophages into the cells - cannot be used normally. 
			==**serum iron is decreased but the TIBC is also decreased!!!**== ==increased ferritin!! plenty of storage iron, just can't use it!== 
	-  sideroblastic anemia - faulty incorperation of iron into that protoporphyrin ring. 
		- ring of extra iron unincorperated and unassociated with any heme !!! **"ringed sideroblasts"**
			- inc ferritin, iron,%saturation but dec TIBC 
		- lead toxicity , zinc, arsenic, - lead interfeers with heme synthesis + iron - 
			- neuro changes, gi upset, gingival lead line 
			- see sideroblastic changes, but not guaranteed in every person 
			- strong association between kids and this 
		- B6 def, inherited, can also be myelodysplastic syndrome 
		- dimorphic rbc population - some normochromic and normocytic and others hypochromic, microcytic
		- ==**we see pappenheimer bodies** in sideroblastic anemia - have a lot of iron== - see them without a stain like howell jolly bodies, but are diff bc **not as dark purple and round - irregularly shaped and made up of iron**
		- basophilic stippling seen 
		- DX: bone marrow biopsy to look for ringed sideroblasts and maturing RBC


![[microcytic anemias iron studies.png]]
![[microcytic anemias CBC.png]]
-  red cell distribution width = higher% = higher variability , RDW
- Myelophthisic anemia - umbrella end result 
	-bone marrow replaced by non-hematopoietic elements - fibrosis, metastatic cancer, granulomatous infection - due to some neoplasm? can also happen due to some storage disorders or other than that 
	peripheral blood smear shows leukoerythroblastosis - immature left shifted granulocytes, nuc RBCs. teardrops 
	- some splenomegaly + / - hepatomegaly 
	- hematopoietic precursors released too early + teardrop shape from squeezing thru that bone marrow into the blood
	- DX: need bone marrow biopsy - replacement of normal bone marrow with fibrosis and metastatic adenocarcinoma can also replace.
