first lesson lowkey a review... 
RBC prod - all from rbcs, and all the pluripotent cells either commit to myeloid or lymphoid (lymphocytes)
myeloid to pronormoblasts then all the way to erythrocyte ! 

in bone marrow to look at rbcs - thyey mature in clusters/islands - aggregates of islands of cells with round very dark nuclei 
- these are paraffin embedded sections 
also smear it wright giemsa stain - round nuclei metachromatic cytoplasm seen - aspirate - maturing rbcs 
most common - peripheral blood smears - see the fully mature rbcs
- biconcave disc, full of hb, 6-8 um, 
- nucleated rbc, reticulocyte, newly formed that still has rna, special stain req 
- polychrmatic form = reticulocyte, retianed rna -> blue / purple 
- when we have anemia, bone marrow knows that we need to make more. when that happens, younger rbcs get released early. **higher rna content + more purple/blue = this is polychromasia, mixture of diff colors**
	- further distinguish it with stain methylene blue, a reticulum clumped material 
	- anemic patient with **appropriate compensation - more reticulocytes in the blood increases**

most iron associated w/ hb , HbA. = adult hb , 2 alpha globin + 2 beta ; amount of types vary based on stage of dev
- we switch from hbF to HbA - hereditary persistance of hbF - binds o2 tighter than HbA = this is a left shift in the curve, 
- recall - hb coorperativity sigmoidal shape. 
- right shift - decrease o2 affinity, more release and more "delivery" - caused by pH acidosis, inc 2,3 DPG, inc in temp
- left shift - binding more tightly, less delivery, high pH alkalosis, less 2,3 dpg, less temp, methemoglobinemia, carboxyhemoglobinemia (met hb and carboxy hb)
met hb - decreased o2 carrying capacity of hb - conversion of iron from reduced state to fe3+ state instead, ferric iron unable to bind/transport oxygen 
- basically acquired = more common, exposure to oxidizing agents of hb like nitrates 
- congenital - defect in cyt b5 reductase , mutations in globin protein too 
- signs and symptoms - chocolate brown blood, **hypoxemia refractory to supp o2**. dyspnea, anxiety, light-headedness, confusion, tachy, etc. 
	- risk for acidosis, coma, death
- TREAT: remove agent, methylene blue injection reducing agent + the supplemental oxygen 
- you put pulse ox on their finger = falsely elevated bc met hb absorbs light at same rate as normal hb 

hb clearance - primary storage of iron is ferritin - good for immediate use
bilirubin - geriatric or prematurely destroyed rbcs. 
unconjugated - not water soluble , conjugated by glucoronydul transferase 
haptoglobin - binds free heme for elimination processed thru macrophages in bone marrow, spleen, liver


anemia - pallor, pale mucous membranes, SOB, some are asymptomatic due to compensation! 
CBC- most common lab - will do concentration of wbc + platelets + rbc indices 
- ordered w differential - 
- rbc count - concentration of rbcs mil/uL
- hb - concentration of hgb g/dL; lysed and burst cells. light transmission measurements. 
- hematocrit - relative volume of packed rbcs %; basically the centrifugation of these 
- mean cell vol MCV = avg size of rbcs fL 
- MCH - mean cell hb - avg amt of hgb in each RBC in pg
- MCHC concntration - avg amt hb per certain concentration of rbs
- red cell distrib wideth RDW - amoutn of variability, higher is more variability % 

microcytic - small rbcs, mcv low
normocytic - norm mcv
macrocytic large mcv high
hypochromia - low decreased hb in rbcs, mchc basically, central pallor > 1/3 , basically more of the clear zone. 
anisocytosis - variation in cell size rdw
poikilocytosis - variation in shape
polychromasia - bluish color in some cells bc of rna in reticulocytes. 
spur cells - acanthocytes - very spiking 
ethinocytes - spikey but less pronounced spines 
teardrops - pointed edge 
sickle cells -drapanocytes
helmet cellls - sheared off border
horn cells - peripheral cutouts
schistocytes - small angulated points, small pieces

anemia classification - can be based on mcv  - 
can also classify based on reticulocyte count (hypoproliferatives(leukemias, aplastic anemias, pure rbc aplasia) vs hyperproliferatives (hemorrhage, hemolytic anemias))
also based on underylying mechanism
- blood loss
- increased destruction
- impaired production 
blood loss
acute/traumatic 
- blood loss, hyppovolemia - fluid shift
- hemodilution normochromic + normocytic; same rbcs as before remember 
- reticulocytosis - 5 days later

chronic - iron deficiency anemia is the result
- common source of gi , gyn tract issue 

![[2b. Red Blood Cells II-Hemolytic Anemias_Rinker_PPT.pdf]]

hemolytic anemias - umbrella term 
- destruction of rbcs, shorteend rbc survival, inc erythropoietin(inc rbc prod), inc bone marrow rbc production, accumulation of breakdown products like jaundice + pigment gallstones 
- intravascular - 
- extravascular - 
- mechanical trauma - like implanted devices like ECMO/heart valves; microangiopathic hemolytic anemias can be this as well: **DIC, TTP HUS**
		these are ripped aparts into schistocytes + hb + LDH 
- free hb will b bound by haptoglobin and then metabolized later. 
	- **shows helmet cells + schistocytes**
- DIC - both from widespread endothelial injury or release of thromboplastic substances
treat underlying cause 

ttp - hyaline thrombi in microcirculation - **def in adamts13 which would usually cleave vWF, making too big complexes -> platelet aggregation uncontrolled**
- can affect cns, gi, and renal. **neurologic changes common!**
- low platelets, fragmented rbcs , anemic, platelets down 
- TREAT with plasma exchange + meds 

HUS - mostly caused by e coli -> shiga like toxin, binds to and dmg glomerular endothelium , making it thrombogenic. 
- other causes are drugs, radiation therapy, etc complement abnormalities 
- bloody diarrhea, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 
- kids 

paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - PNH
- acquired memb defect secondary to acquired mutation affecting hematopoietic stem cells
- PIGA - phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor - can get acquired mutations ; CD55 and CD59 
	- normal ones have this, which protects from complement mediated lysis 
	- rbcs lacking it are more prone to complement destruction. 
- signs - episodic discolored urine; get dark + lighten up again + thrombosis 
- complement mediated - **happens in spleens not vessels. - we see spherocytes, very spherical but lose that concave shape therefore central poiwer!!!**
	- microspherocytes!!! 
	- we don't have CD59, 55, FLAER - flow cytometry to id wbcs + rbcs that lack these GPI anchor proteins ... 
	- most have some bone marrow dysfunction; over time can develop worse nad get leukemia or myeloid something  
TREAT: bone marrow transplant. can develop into aplastic anemia and/or subsequent leukemia 


glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd - 
- x linked recessive enz african (mild) and mediterranean mod/severe
	- in men all express it 
	- in women only half of all rbcs show it 
- glutathione metabolism, in normal rbcs reduced glutathione gsh protects rbcs from oxidative injury 
- deficiency = rbcs more prone to ox injury + hemolysis 
- **episodic hemolytic anemia, associated w drugs, toxins, fava beans + infections**
	- bakc pain + hemoglobinuria
	- sudden pallor, jaundice, etc. 
	- cross linking of globins -> makes **heinz bodies denatured proteins + damaged bite cells that happen with removal of heinz bodies!**
	- peripheral smear - regularly not seen heinz bodies

malaria - major cause of hemolytic anemia!!! huge issue
- four types in humans - 
	- plasmodium... falciparum
	- malariae
	- ovale
	- vivax 
- clinial symptoms
	- headaches 
	- cyclic fevers
	- joint pain
	- hemolytic anemia 
- TREAT: quinines
intracellular trophozites - ring shaped - immature 
extracellular gametocytes - banana shaped ; mature 


autoimmune hemolytic anemias 
- phagocytosis by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial systems.... 
- peripheral blood - microspherocytes; fc receptors bind to the antibodies + eat it + remove sme of the rbc membrane, which reseals into the microspherocyte 
- **direct antigobulin test - DAT/coombs test positive.** 
	- basically wash and remove the rbcs, just has the floating proteins then id with monoclonal antibodies against igg and complements 
- microspherocytes!! similar to different causes of extravascular hemolysis 
- warm rxns - antibodies igG usually react to rbcs at room temp, opsonized by autoantibodies and cleared by spleen reticuloendothelial cells - extravasc hemolysis
	- causes - idiopathic, sle, b-cell lymphomas, or drug induced. like methyldopa, penicillin, quinidine? hugee thing on immune complexes 
	- splenomegaly seen too 
- cold dz - IgM bind to rbcs at colder temps, fixing copmlement, rbcs destroyed by it 
	- idiopathic  , b-cell lymphomas, **mycoplasma or infectious mononucleosis infection**
	- reynaud phenomeon can be seen due to agglutination!!
	- IgM - big blumps of rbcs can be formed

rbc membrane defects
hereditary spherocytosis- AD!!! more fragile and more suseptible to stress . clinical stability and severeityv
- defect in cytoskeletal proteins 
- ankyrin, spectrin
- clinical signs - anemia, splenomegaly, jaundice, cholelithiasis
- stable course punctuated by hemolytic crises / infection, or aplastic crises like parvovirus b19
