note - study all the slides in the presentation for the basis 
- epidermis then dermis then subcutis fat under skin 
	- cornified layers = topmost, stratum corneum, shedding basket weave dead keratin
	- granular layer / granulosum = hyaline matured keratinocytes, 
	- spinous layers - keratinocytes, all connected by **desmosomes** and **hemidesmosome spines**
	- basal layer = where melanocytes live,, and basal keratinocytes. same amt of melanocytes (bigger density in eyelids/nipples), but clinically different skin tones are amt of melanin made and type of melanin 
	- undulating pattern due to **rete pegs of the epidermis** and then dermal papillae which is upward projections of the dermis - interdigitation to give skin strength 
	- in dermis - there's capillaries, and then melanophages = 
		- these are keratinocytes that are damaged, causing melanocytes to fall in dermis, and get eaten up - > **manifest as HYPER/HYPOPIGMENTATION!**
- solar elastosis - dermis blue gray color sun dmg, wrinkles 
- arrector pili - gives us goosebumps 
- hair follicles and shafts - if it goes pretty deep down, they're terminal hairs, so they keep growing in some areas like scalp ....
- no hair follicles in palms + soles. so if you see something kinda resembling one, know that it's bc of rubbing or something 
- sebacious glands in face and stuff
- thick collagen/dermis = the back , the trunk
- thinnest = eyelids

histo/microscopic vocab 
hyperkeratosis - lots of keratin; never normal, mainly neoplastic manifestations or inflammatory ... we might see **rashes that are SCALEY!!!!**  
- orthokeratosis - thicken cornified layer without retention of nuclei - loss of basket weave top layer
	- only thing that it might be normal at is palms + soles with thick cornosum , some rubbing 
- parakeratosis - basket weaves with retained nuclei , still cornified layer!!! 

acanthosis - thickening of epidermis, hyperplasia 

papillomatosis - surface elevation , bumpy surface caused by **hyperplasia + enlargement of dermal papillae, which is where the dermal papillae are too tall**
- classically - warts ,bumpy surface

spongiosis - intracellular edema - **spines very prominent and visible** - this is in very wet eruptions ! 

acantholysis - lysis/disruption of intercellular keratinocyte adhesive junctions - **normal spinous layers all disrupted - seen in inflammatory, neoplastic, an hereditary conditions**

dyskeratosis - abnormal, premture keratinization - basically weird and sworly strange histology - **cells get super pink and super small**

exocytosis - lymphocytes that migrate into epidermis, looks like = pinkish things in the dark kerotincytes, paired with spongiosis often enough 

dermis - 
inflammation = dermatitis 
- papillary dermis = the dermal papille
- reticular dermis = right below the papillary dermis, slightly darker and goes all the way down to the subq tissue. gives all the structure to it, protection 
- vessels in it 
- adnexal structures like hair follicle, eccrine gland + duct
	- sweat! heat regulation 
	- sexual functions like pheremones 
	- hair - keep skin safe, helps with rubbing etc. 
- we can also see scars in it!!
	- **we can have a keloid or hypertrophic scar = dermal reparative reaction, basically where layers of dermis + ADNEXAL STRUCTURES GONE, all replaced by bubble gum pink collagen.**
 
subcutis = subcutaneous tissue = deepest layer inflammation is **panniculitis**
- fibroadipose tissues - deep to the dermis - 
- we would need a deep biopsy to get to this
