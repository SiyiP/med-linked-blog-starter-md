note - study all the slides in the presentation for the basis 
- epidermis then dermis then subcutis fat under skin 
	- ==cornified layers = topmost, stratum corneum, shedding basket weave dead keratin==
		- ==**changes to this will never happen unless it's subacute or chronic**==
	- ==granular layer / granulosum = hyaline matured keratinocytes,== 
	- ==spinous layers - keratinocytes, all connected by **desmosomes** and **hemidesmosome spines**==
	- ==basal layer = where melanocytes live==,, and ==basal keratinocytes==. same amt of melanocytes (bigger density in eyelids/nipples), but clinically different skin tones are amt of melanin made and type of melanin 
	- ==undulating pattern to give strength: due to **rete pegs of the epidermis** and then dermal papillae which is upward projections of the dermis== - interdigitation to give skin strength 
	- in ==dermis - there's capillaries, and then melanophages== = 
		- these are ==keratinocytes that are damaged, causing melanocytes to fall in dermis, and get eaten up - > **manifest as HYPER/HYPOPIGMENTATION!**==
- ==solar elastosis - dermis blue gray color sun dmg==, wrinkles 
- arrector pili - gives us goosebumps 
- ==hair follicles and shafts - if it goes pretty deep down, they're terminal hairs==, so they keep growing in some areas like scalp ....
- ==no hair follicles in palms + soles==. so ==if you see something kinda resembling one, know that it's bc of rubbing or something== 
- sebacious glands in face and stuff
- thick collagen/dermis = the back , the trunk
- thinnest = eyelids 
---
histo/microscopic vocab 
==hyperkeratosis - lots of keratin==; never normal, mainly neoplastic manifestations or inflammatory ... ==we might see **rashes that are SCALEY!!!!**==  
- ==orthokeratosis - thicken cornified layer **without** retention of nuclei - loss of basket weave top layer==
	- only thing that it might be normal at is palms + soles with thick cornosum , some rubbing 
- ==parakeratosis - basket weaves with **retained** nuclei , still cornified layer!!!== 

==acanthosis - thickening of epidermis, hyperplasia== 

==papillomatosis - surface elevation , bumpy surface like warts caused by **hyperplasia + enlargement of dermal papillae==, which is where the dermal papillae are too tall**
- classically - warts ,bumpy surface

==spongiosis - intracellular edema - **spines very prominent and visible** - this is in very wet eruptions !== 

==acantholysis - lysis/disruption of intercellular keratinocyte adhesive junctions== - **==normal spinous layers all disrupted== - seen in ==inflammatory, neoplastic, an hereditary== conditions**

==dyskeratosis - abnormal, premature keratinization, cells very pink and small - basically weird and sworly strange histology== - **cells get super pink and super small**

==exocytosis - lymphocytes that migrate into epidermis==, looks like = pinkish things in the dark kerotinocytes, ==paired with spongiosis often enough== 

dermis - 
inflammation = dermatitis ; ==dermis== 
- ==papillary dermis = the dermal papillae==
- ==reticular dermis = right below the papillary dermis, slightly darker and goes all the way down to the subq tissue. gives all the structure to it, protection== 
- vessels in it 
- ==adnexal structures like hair follicle, eccrine gland + duct==
	- sweat! heat regulation 
	- sexual functions like pheremones 
	- hair - keep skin safe, helps with rubbing etc. 
- we can also see scars in it!!
	- **we can have a ==keloid or hypertrophic scar = dermal reparative reaction, basically where layers of dermis + ADNEXAL STRUCTURES GONE, all replaced by bubble gum pink collagen==.**
 
==subcutis = subcutaneous tissue = deepest layer inflammation is **panniculitis**==
- ==fibroadipose tissues - deep to the dermis -== 
- we would need a deep biopsy to get to this 
---
[[-FPC Clinical Dermatology_Hampton]]
- macule, flat + circumscribed (<1.0 cm) =>>>> patch larger circumscribed flat lesion (1.0+)
- papule, solid and firm, **raised**!!!! (<1.0 cm)-?>>> nodule (1+ cm), like contact derm or skin cancer ; both dome shaped 
	- plaque 1+ cm, **elevated flat topped lesion**
- vesicle - clear fluid filled small blister -> bulla - fluid filled blister large 
- pustule = blister , **raised, discrete PUS-filled**
- wheal = hive = urticaria = serous fluid coming out of blood vessels into the interstitium, causing swelling!!
	- "washed out" = evanescent
	- variable blanching !!! bgd erethema

2ndary stufff
- erosion - loss of epidermis, no penetration of dermal epidermal junction meaning no scarring 
- ulceration - a deep ulcer loss of epidermis going thru Dermal epidermal junction = scarring! 
- excoriation = focal shallow erosion with scale and crust sticking to it , like skin digging  = **traumatic SELF inflicted break in skin due to scratching**- all that crust we can see scab microscopically 
- **lichenification - thickened rough skin due to repeat rubbing/scratching!!!** = acanthosis but big scale + hyperkeratosis 
- crust/scab = dried serum, pus, blood and epithelial debris... many bacterial colonies and stuff, a lot 
- scale = laminated or plate-like mass of keratin due to **abnormal keratinization - keratin's not dispersing and leaving as it should**
	- dry, greasy, delicate, coarse, micaceous, white/yellow/brown 
	- hyperkeratosis 
---
SKIN 2!!!!
---
urticaria - hives
- erythematous, edematous plaques which are wheals, anywhere
- pruritic, come and go = evanescent, only been there a couple of hours,,, itchyness, but episode lengths vary 
- TREAT: self-limited, antihistamines, leukotriene antag, immunosuppression 
- MAST CELL deganulation -> dermal microvascular hyperperm
	- type 1 hypersensitivity rxns with allergens 
	- there's many physical/inducible forms !
	- physical = pressure related, some cold related, cholinegic (need more hx), exercise, dermatographism, they scrape their derm on the back - see if we can induce it with ice pack, reproduable, etc 
- microscopically: **invisible dermatosis !!!! normal epidermis, just with some edema in dermis, perivascular inflammation eosinophils/neutrophils, dermal vessels stuffed.**
	- white spaces in between dermis collagen bundles = edema
	- some vascularities stuffed with little cells = perivascular inflammation


eczematous dermatitides =
- eczema - large category - "to boil forth, WET"
- recall they get acute oozy erythematous plaques with oozy and crusted vesicles, then scaly plaques, then pruritus - "so itchy ):"
- biggest thing: **spongiosis**
	- spongiotic dermatitis: the micro version 
	- acutely - normal cornified layers, spongiosis +/- spongiotic vesicles(little white blister formed by edema by keratinocytes), exocytosis of lymphocytes, superficial perivascular inflammation 
![[eczema micro.png|372x285]]
- subacute = for things like atopic derm, we see changes in the **cornified layer = parakeratosis + serum crust, spongiosis, acanthosis(thickened epidermis), exocytosis of lymphocytes**
	- also some superficial perivasc inflammation just like before
![[subacute eczema micro.png]]
- allergic contact derm , like allergies to poison ivy 
	- allergic = sensitizing agent exposure specific to you - type 4 hypersensitivity 
	- distribution + patch testing helps 
	- itchy 
- irritant contact derm = fixed exposure to see that 
	- non-specific inflammation 
	- prior exposure not necessary 
	- **burning and pain!!!**
- atopic dermatitis - 
	- itch that rashes... very itchy, chronic course + other atopic (huge to develop allergies etc) conditions too like asthma 
	- **due to defect in keratinocyte barrier function + inc sensitivity to antigens-> sensitivity... variable age.**
- nummular derm 
	- coin shaped lesions with some scales 
- dyshidrotic eczema 
	- acral sites - intracellular edema gets so big we get "tapioca pearls , like little clear fluid filled things"
- TREAT: lifestyle mods, topical steroids, phototherapy, immunosuppression (if super diffuse)

erythema multiforme EM
- erythematous, macules/papules/vesicles/bullae, "targetoid lesions" - have a dusky or necrotic center!![[erythema multiform clinical lesions.png]]
- entire body, but characteristicall palm/sole/mucosa 
- microscopic - very acute thing - so normal cornified layers
	- scattered necrotic keratinocytes -> epidermal necrosis, leading ot the type of dusky center of that targetoid lesion 
	- band like infiltrate at dermoepidermal junction 
![[erythema multiforme micro.png]]
- t cell mediated hypersensitivity response
	- HSV, mycoplasma
	- drugs = antibiotics, salicylates(OTC), antimalarias
- TREAT: supportive and stop agent/,manage underlying thing 

note: erythema multiforme secondary to ***drug* is on a spectrum with Stevens-johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis**
- sloughing of significant body SA 
- similar risks to burn pts ; hugely blackened skin peeling, high med emergency ): 
- micro: we see a huge white gap between dermis + epidermis due to necrosis = **no inflammatory rxn with band like infiltrate at dermoepidermal junction**
- drug rxns + eruptions 
	- huge, but certain populations at inc risk are HIV, polypharm, inpatients 
	- fixed drug rxn
		- quickly developed post-exposure, comes back at the same place
		- progresses to genitalia
	- chemtherapy - red painful hands + sweat gland inflammation
		- flagellate like rxn, looks like someone whipped them, very linear where all the vasuclature is there 
	- lichenoid rxns
	- DRESS rxns - **eosinophilia involved = end organ involvement basically**
	when there's a drug thing going on 
	1. get rash morphology + distrib
	2. check for extracutaneous involvement = genitals, mucosa, conjunctivitis
	3. stop any unnecessary meds
	4. get thru drug hx + timeline. sometimes you can't determine.

==morphea - cutaneous localized scleroderma== [[-SFP Autoimmune Diseases I+II_Baker Frost]][[-SFP History and Clinical Manifestations of Rheumatological Disorders_Baker Frost]]
- ==erythematous-violaceus macules/plaques -> eventually we get **smooth, depressed white ivory lesions, loss of skin elasticity**==
- more palpable - ==skin's too tight, limit mobility ; **end state sclerosis doesn't really get treated ):**==
	- ==MICRO: "**square punch**" - where we get dense dermal sclerosis with **homogenized pink collagen**, loss of adnexal fat structures, plasma rich infiltrate at Dermal subq interface...== 
- children + adults, mainly female
- ==TREAT: topical/intralesional steroids, phototherapy, immunosuppression== 

psoriasis - very common 
- well-demarkated, PINK plaques with silver-white scale
- symmetric distribution, scalp, etc. 
- **nail pits + oil spots or wavy white parts on nails**, geographic tongue(white stuff looking like a map on it)
	- treat for psoriatic arthritis if tey have it ): 
- TREAT: topical/intralesional steroids, phototherapy, methotrexate
- plaques - white well demarkated
- linear variety 
- guttate = like dewdrops / raindrops
- inverse - pattern opposite to where it is 
- erythrodermic - most body is red and kinda scaley 
- MICRO: **mound like *parakeratosis* with *neutrophil* microabscesses**
	- psoriasiform acanthosis - **meaning it's REGULAR with its undulations** - causing the plaque to form 
	- diminished granular layer 
	- dilated, tortuous papillary dermal vessels
	- ![[psoriasis.png]]

lichen planus
- 5-6 Ps

post-inflammatory pigment alteration  = PIPA 
- hyper/hypo pigmentation after inflammatory condition 
- might take significantly more time to resolve post-resolution of inflammatory process = 
- MICRO: **melanophages are in the dermis**
	- APCs will go into the lymph nodes, so they get swollen. 

---
blistering disorders; make side-by-sides later on 
small blister = vesicle 
big one = bullae 
also, where's the split that CAUSES that bilster?
- subcorneal 
- suprabasal 
- subepidermal - expect it to be tense, entire roof is the epidermis, so it's pretty strong 

pemphigus vulgaris
- flaccid bullae, easily ruptured -> crusted, painful erosions 
- mucosa, scalp, fac, neck, axilla, groin 
- 5-6th decade
- **IgG antibodies desmoglein 1 and 3(3 is for mucosal involvement).... morbidity due to infection + fluid imbalances**
- we see a huge suprabasilar splits,  with acantholysis , which causes this split - tombstones
	- epidermis is lifted up, and then the white space in between is the blister
	- keratinocytes = tombstones in this split 
	- we can do Direct immunofluorescne for IgG and C3 
	- ![[pemphigus vulgaris IF pattern.png]]
	- we get a "net-like immunofloresence pattern" between keratinocytes..
	![[pemphigus vulgaris.png]]

pemphigus foliaceus
- flaccid bullae, this time with a **cornflake crust**, very thin and exfoliations too
- antibody IgG to desmoglein-1 , **rarely on any mucosa bc of this**
- subcorneal split; more superficial with neutrophils + acantholytic cells
- DIF: intercellular net-like igG + C3 more prominent superficially
- ![[pemphigus foliaceus.png|310x243]]

bullous pemphigoid
- large tense bullae -> erythematous patches + urticarial plaques 
- pruritus; I am soo itchy but sometimes we don't see anything yet 
- groin, axilla, trunk, thighs, forearms 
- ELDERYLY 
- **IgG antibodies to basement membrane BPA1 and BPA2**
- MICRO: subepidermal split w **eosinophils** -
- this time we have a **linear deposition** of IgG + C3 along dermoepidermal junction 
- ![[bullous pemphigoid.png|279x226]]
	![[bullous pemphigoid if.png|288x215]] - linear


==dermatitis herpetiformis==
- small grouped excoriated papules - we can't really tell they're blistered most the time bc pt's itched them off already ; ==small/tiny grouped red dots== 
- ==bilateral, symmetric, extensor surfaces, elbows, knees, butts==
- ==intense pruritis== 
- ==**celiac dz !!! responds to gluten free diet**== 
- ==MICRO: neutrophil microabscesses in TIPs of dermal papillae - subepidermal vesicle== 
- ==![[dermatitis herpetiformis.png]]==
- ==DIF: granular igA deposition==

skin pathology IV- neoplasms and malignancies
---
==benign epidermal neoplasms + Non melanoma skin Cancer (NMSC==, some kind of skin cancer but not pigmented)
1. ==seborrheic keratosis - benign "barnacles/age spots"==
	- tan, brown, black;
	- ==oval, stuck on, waxy papule or plaque==
	- any location except groin, palms, soles, 
	- for adults, ==onset 4th or 5th decade==
	- ==TREAT: liquid nitrogen, curettage, shave removal==
	- ==MICRO: "waxy or stuck-on," caused by **acanthosis and hyperkeratosis (shredded wheat, too much of the normal basket weave structure)**== 
		- ==papillomatosis - undullating bumpiness to the region +==
		- ==pseudohorn cysts! little cysts of keratin connecting to surface.== 
		- and a variable pigment inside bland basaloid cells 
		- ==![[seborrheic keratosis.png]]==
	- sometimes - patients can get **HUNDREDS of these!!! on their trunk** - this is sign of ==Leser-trelat = paraneoplastic syndrome due to internal malignancy, like **GI carcinomas**, when patients get too many SUDDENLY!==
2. ==actinic keratosis - actinic = sun .... so keratosis mediated by UV exposure- *dysplasia*==
	- ==ill-defined scaly lesions of various colors, can be flat or elevated, usually small== 
	- begin in ==6th decade, onset can be with younger fair skinned ppl== 
	- *==*premalignant lesion -> small risk of progressing to carcionma== per year**
	- ==TREAT: liquid nitrogen, topical chemo== 
	- ==MICRO: "scaley, ill-defined" = **parakeratosis**, cytologic ATYPIA in lower portion of epidermis "dysplasia" , solar elastosis== 
	- ==![[actinic keratosis.png]]==
	-  we would biopsy this long poke-y thing of keratin, hard like a nail -> ==biopsy: keratin =**cutaneous horn, just a lot of hyperkeratosis**== (this is nonspecific, warts can make it and carcinomas make it too)

3. ==squamous cell carcinoma in situ== 
- ==**very very similar to actinic keratosis, but full thickness of cytologic atypia**==
- ==paget-like==

1. ==invasive squamous cell carcinoma -== 
- ==scaley or ulcerated nodule== 
- sun exposure; ==UV mediated== 
- ==older adults, M>F==
- TREAT: ==excision== 
- ==other predisposing factors than sun dmg==
	- ==immunosuppressant - like HPV== 
	- ==industrial / chem exposures = tars, oils, **arsenic, like in the peedee region of tobacco farming**==
	- ==ionizing radiation== 
	- ==marjolin ulcers = long standing scar/wound , we see worsening suddenly then we check for that!==
- ==MICRO: nest and clusters of very different squamous cells invading dermis with desmoplastic rxn, very nice and pink + poorly differentiated. can also be seen in lungs, esophagus , penis, vulva, anus etc== 
- hard to tell where it comes from 

1. ==basal cell carcinoma== 
- variable, but classically ==**pearly papule with telangiectatic vessels**==
- very common, UV exposure, ==UV; very slow growing with very low rate of metastasis==
- ==TREAT: excision, hedgehog pathway inhibitors in metastatic cases== 
- ==MICRO: nests and islands of **basaloid cells with peripheral palisading(single layer of long cells) set in fibromyxoid stroma with *clefting***==
	- many growth patterns 
	- ulcerations or focal squamous differentiation - hard to tell difference between squamous and basal cell. 
	==![[basal cell carcinoma.png]]==

1. ==merkel Cell carcinoma== 
- ==rapidly enlaging non -tender red violaceous nodules==
- sun exposed skin of ==ELDERLY== ; ==looks small and discountable, but the worst of it all==
	- regional lymph node + distant metastasis 
	- ==looks like a big blue block: sheets + ribbons of hyperchromatic cells with scant cytoplasm and smudged chromatins== 
- ==due to : merkel cell polyoma virus MCPV and UV exposure==

---
==melanocytic proliferations== 
1. ==melanocytic nevi==
	- ==benign== proliferation of melanocytes - can see them anywhere
	- inc. amount of ==melanocytes can make a nest - this is congenital or acquired in childhood - young adulthood, occuring anywhere skin and mucosa== 
		- ==junctional nevus - when it's on the EDJ, **flat and small**==
		- ==compound nevus - both epidermal and dermal nests **we see circumscribed small lesion + nests in dermis too**==
		- ==intradermal nevus - when it's just in the dermis layer **more PAPULAR!!! microscopically we see a raised papule with nests of melanocytes**==
	- ==melanocytes = **are from neural crest cells. look like nerves sometimes==
	- no treatment necessary - angela's ear ! -
	- ==MICRO: well circumscribed, **we can see the nests so easily at tips and sides of rete or in the dermis!!**==
		- nest + ==melanocytes get smaller and lose pigment as they break into smaller nests while they go deeper into the skin== - so they almost look like lymphocytes in the dermis layer -> scatter into single melanocytes dispersed in the deeper skin 
2. ==atypical melanocytic nevus==
	- clarks/dysplastic - what some ppl call it 
	- ==larger, >5 mm, might be macule and or plaque, irregular borders , sporadic or inherited== 
	- ==**no inc risk of turning into melanomas** - just "funny looking nevi"==
	- variegated, macule, ==plaque with **irregular borders**==, on either sun or covered skin 
	- ==a larger amt might mean more worry for family hx== 
	- ==micro - *horizontally* oriented **junctional nets with BRIDGING between rete**==
		- ==lamellar fibroplasia - we see **extra pink looking stroma right under nest of melanocytes in the papillary dermis**==
		- we can see a junctional component extending beyond the dermal component = like an ==overhang in rock climbing = junctional component extends beyond dermal== 
		- sparse lympohcytic inflammation in dermis too  !==![[atypical melanocytic nevus.png]]==
3. ==Blue nevus - an **exception!! you can get them any time of your life**==
	- very ==heavily pigmented, blue black color, lots of pigment, wedge-shaped dermal proliferation of heavily pigmented **spindled melanocytes**==
	- don't mature 
4. ==halo nevus - a dark dot. + hypopigmented lighter rim around it== 
	- ==immune system making melanocytes regress around it== 
	- ==benign *in* *children* but can also be harbinger of vitiligo==
	- but adult - need full check + removal .... bc make sure it's completely removed. 
	- ==MICRO: huge amount of **dense lymphocyte inflammation**== 
5. ==recurrent nevus - if they get a biopsy and don't remove the whole thing==
	- brownish dot, deep residual left over in the scar, then you can see recurrence/repopulation
	- looks like a melanoma so you have to tell the derm ppl about removal of nevus
6. ==congenital nevus==
7. ==spitz nevus - benign, are very very dark/erythematous - **we see big heavily pigmented spindled EPITHELIOID MELANOCYTES IN VERTICAL nests**==
	- similar to spitz melanoma, keep an eye out 
8. ==**malignant: melanoma**== 
	- ==majority - de novo but some come within melanocytic nevi ; can be anywhere !== 
	- mainly ==UV induced dmg + stepwise mutations build-up== in mutations 
	- ==melanoma in situ - confined to epidermis, lacks metastatic potential==
	- invasive = ==prognosis associated with DEPTH== 
	- ABCs of it
		- asymmetry 
		- irregular Border
		- color - multiple or changing 
		- Diameter larger than pencil eraser 
		- evolution - any change clinically 
	==-"ugly duckling sign"- lesion looks different than the rest== 
	-any new picgmented lesion in adult might be this
	==TREAT: local wide excision. close clinical surveillence==
	- ==sentinel lymph node biopsy - put dye inside, then trace to whatever lymph nodes==
	- ==radiation==
	- ==BRAF/CKIT(mucosal stuff) inhib==
	- ==immunotherapy== 
	- ==MICRO: abnormal or lack of functional nests, no circumscription== 
		- ==melanocytes holding hands all across the basal layer, or they are extending into **upper parts of epidermis = paget scatter**==; you see melanocytes as greyish blue color 
		- ==lack of maturation in dermis, so they retain pigment, and nests don't get smaller with depth== 
		- mitosis + nuc pleomorphism ==![[pagetoid scatter melanoma.png]]==
- note - ==spindle melanomas - can look like sarcomas or neurofibromas== 
- ==cutaneous metastases = in small parts of skin, all around, or regional lymph nodes, **visceral organs like the brain where they might get hemorrhages**==
