![[Skin I-Terminology and Structure_Forcucci_PPT (1).pdf]]

note - study all the slides in the presentation for the basis 
- epidermis then dermis then subcutis fat under skin 
	- cornified layers = topmost, stratum corneum, shedding basket weave dead keratin
		- **changes to this will never happen unless it's subacute or chronic**
	- granular layer / granulosum = hyaline matured keratinocytes, 
	- spinous layers - keratinocytes, all connected by **desmosomes** and **hemidesmosome spines**
	- basal layer = where melanocytes live,, and basal keratinocytes. same amt of melanocytes (bigger density in eyelids/nipples), but clinically different skin tones are amt of melanin made and type of melanin 
	- undulating pattern due to **rete pegs of the epidermis** and then dermal papillae which is upward projections of the dermis - interdigitation to give skin strength 
	- in dermis - there's capillaries, and then melanophages = 
		- these are keratinocytes that are damaged, causing melanocytes to fall in dermis, and get eaten up - > **manifest as HYPER/HYPOPIGMENTATION!**
- solar elastosis - dermis blue gray color sun dmg, wrinkles 
- arrector pili - gives us goosebumps 
- hair follicles and shafts - if it goes pretty deep down, they're terminal hairs, so they keep growing in some areas like scalp ....
- no hair follicles in palms + soles. so if you see something kinda resembling one, know that it's bc of rubbing or something 
- sebacious glands in face and stuff
- thick collagen/dermis = the back , the trunk
- thinnest = eyelids 
---
histo/microscopic vocab 
hyperkeratosis - lots of keratin; never normal, mainly neoplastic manifestations or inflammatory ... we might see **rashes that are SCALEY!!!!**  
- orthokeratosis - thicken cornified layer without retention of nuclei - loss of basket weave top layer
	- only thing that it might be normal at is palms + soles with thick cornosum , some rubbing 
- parakeratosis - basket weaves with retained nuclei , still cornified layer!!! 

acanthosis - thickening of epidermis, hyperplasia 

papillomatosis - surface elevation , bumpy surface caused by **hyperplasia + enlargement of dermal papillae, which is where the dermal papillae are too tall**
- classically - warts ,bumpy surface

spongiosis - intracellular edema - **spines very prominent and visible** - this is in very wet eruptions ! 

acantholysis - lysis/disruption of intercellular keratinocyte adhesive junctions - **normal spinous layers all disrupted - seen in inflammatory, neoplastic, an hereditary conditions**

dyskeratosis - abnormal, premture keratinization - basically weird and sworly strange histology - **cells get super pink and super small**

exocytosis - lymphocytes that migrate into epidermis, looks like = pinkish things in the dark kerotincytes, paired with spongiosis often enough 

dermis - 
inflammation = dermatitis 
- papillary dermis = the dermal papille
- reticular dermis = right below the papillary dermis, slightly darker and goes all the way down to the subq tissue. gives all the structure to it, protection 
- vessels in it 
- adnexal structures like hair follicle, eccrine gland + duct
	- sweat! heat regulation 
	- sexual functions like pheremones 
	- hair - keep skin safe, helps with rubbing etc. 
- we can also see scars in it!!
	- **we can have a keloid or hypertrophic scar = dermal reparative reaction, basically where layers of dermis + ADNEXAL STRUCTURES GONE, all replaced by bubble gum pink collagen.**
 
subcutis = subcutaneous tissue = deepest layer inflammation is **panniculitis**
- fibroadipose tissues - deep to the dermis - 
- we would need a deep biopsy to get to this 
---
[[-FPC Clinical Dermatology_Hampton]]
- macule, flat + circumscribed (<1.0 cm) =>>>> patch larger circumscribed flat lesion (1.0+)
- papule, solid and firm, **raised**!!!! (<1.0 cm)-?>>> nodule (1+ cm), like contact derm or skin cancer ; both dome shaped 
	- plaque 1+ cm, **elevated flat topped lesion**
- vesicle - clear fluid filled small blister -> bulla - fluid filled blister large 
- pustule = blister , **raised, discrete PUS-filled**
- wheal = hive = urticaria = serous fluid coming out of blood vessels into the interstitium, causing swelling!!
	- "washed out" = evanescent
	- variable blanching !!! bgd erethema

2ndary stufff
- erosion - loss of epidermis, no penetration of dermal epidermal junction meaning no scarring 
- ulceration - a deep ulcer loss of epidermis going thru Dermal epidermal junction = scarring! 
- excoriation = focal shallow erosion with scale and crust sticking to it , like skin digging  = **traumatic SELF inflicted break in skin due to scratching**- all that crust we can see scab microscopically 
- **lichenification - thickened rough skin due to repeat rubbing/scratching!!!** = acanthosis but big scale + hyperkeratosis 
- crust/scab = dried serum, pus, blood and epithelial debris... many bacterial colonies and stuff, a lot 
- scale = laminated or plate-like mass of keratin due to **abnormal keratinization - keratin's not dispersing and leaving as it should**
	- dry, greasy, delicate, coarse, micaceous, white/yellow/brown 
	- hyperkeratosis 
---
SKIN 2!!!!
urticaria - hives
- erythematous, edematous plaques which are wheals, anywhere
- pruritic, come and go = evanescent, only been there a couple of hours,,, itchyness, but episode lengths vary 
- TREAT: self-limited, antihistamines, leukotriene antag, immunosuppression 
- MAST CELL deganulation -> dermal microvascular hyperperm
	- type 1 hypersensitivity rxns with allergens 
	- there's many physical/inducible forms !
	- physical = pressure related, some cold related, cholinegic (need more hx), exercise, dermatographism, they scrape their derm on the back - see if we can induce it with ice pack, reproduable, etc 
- microscopically: **invisible dermatosis !!!! normal epidermis, just with some edema in dermis, perivascular inflammation eosinophils/neutrophils, dermal vessels stuffed.**
	- white spaces in between dermis collagen bundles = edema
	- some vascularities stuffed with little cells = perivascular inflammation


eczematous dermatitides =
- eczema - large category - "to boil forth, WET"
- recall they get acute oozy erythematous plaques with oozy and crusted vesicles, then scaly plaques, then pruritus - "so itchy ):"
- biggest thing: **spongiosis**
	- spongiotic dermatitis: the micro version 
	- acutely - normal cornified layers, spongiosis +/- spongiotic vesicles(little white blister formed by edema by keratinocytes), exocytosis of lymphocytes, superficial perivascular inflammation 
![[eczema micro.png|372x285]]
- subacute = for things like atopic derm, we see changes in the **cornified layer = parakeratosis + serum crust, spongiosis, acanthosis(thickened epidermis), exocytosis of lymphocytes**
	- also some superficial perivasc inflammation just like before
![[subacute eczema micro.png]]
- allergic contact derm , like allergies to poison ivy 
	- allergic = sensitizing agent exposure specific to you - type 4 hypersensitivity 
	- distribution + patch testing helps 
	- itchy 
- irritant contact derm = fixed exposure to see that 
	- non-specific inflammation 
	- prior exposure not necessary 
	- **burning and pain!!!**
- atopic dermatitis - 
	- itch that rashes... very itchy, chronic course + other atopic (huge to develop allergies etc) conditions too like asthma 
	- **due to defect in keratinocyte barrier function + inc sensitivity to antigens-> sensitivity... variable age.**
- nummular derm 
	- coin shaped lesions with some scales 
- dyshidrotic eczema 
	- acral sites - intracellular edema gets so big we get "tapioca pearls , like little clear fluid filled things"
- TREAT: lifestyle mods, topical steroids, phototherapy, immunosuppression (if super diffuse)

erythema multiforme EM
- erythematous, macules/papules/vesicles/bullae, "targetoid lesions" - have a dusky or necrotic center!![[erythema multiform clinical lesions.png]]
- entire body, but characteristicall palm/sole/mucosa 
- microscopic - very acute thing - so normal cornified layers
	- scattered necrotic keratinocytes -> epidermal necrosis, leading ot the type of dusky center of that targetoid lesion 
	- band like infiltrate at dermoepidermal junction 
![[erythema multiforme micro.png]]
- t cell mediated hypersensitivity response
	- HSV, mycoplasma
	- drugs = antibiotics, salicylates(OTC), antimalarias
- TREAT: supportive and stop agent/,manage underlying thing 

note: erythema multiforme secondary to ***drug* is on a spectrum with Stevens-johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis**
- sloughing of significant body SA 
- similar risks to burn pts ; hugely blackened skin peeling, high med emergency ): 
- micro: we see a huge white gap between dermis + epidermis due to necrosis = **no inflammatory rxn with band like infiltrate at dermoepidermal junction**
- drug rxns + eruptions 
	- huge, but certain populations at inc risk are HIV, polypharm, inpatients 
	- fixed drug rxn
		- quickly developed post-exposure, comes back at the same place
		- progresses to genitalia
	- chemtherapy - red painful hands + sweat gland inflammation
		- flagellate like rxn, looks like someone whipped them, very linear where all the vasuclature is there 
	- lichenoid rxns
	- DRESS rxns - **eosinophilia involved = end organ involvement basically**
	when there's a drug thing going on 
	1. get rash morphology + distrib
	2. check for extracutaneous involvement = genitals, mucosa, conjunctivitis
	3. stop any unnecessary meds
	4. get thru drug hx + timeline. sometimes you can't determine.

infectious derm
impetigo - **honey-colored crust**
- erythematous macules, face + extremities, bullous form 
- mainly kids; "school sores" 
- MICRO: we see subcorneal collection of neutrophils, staph etc , note a lot of purple in chunks in the upper layers 
- TREAT: topical antibiotics
- subcorneal collection = neutrophils, serum crust, g-poz cocci 
- s. aureus/strep pyogenes 

folliculitis - inflammation of the **follicules!**
- crops of follicular red pustules + hairy skin 
- s. aureus mostly 
- TREAT: topical antibiotics, antibacterial washes
- MICRO: acute inflammation around hair follicule -> rupture + **granulomatous inflammation, so you see some neutrophils + circles**

cellulitis
- erythematous, edematous, tender 'warm to touch'
- abscess / lymphangitis, 
- wound or other portal of entry that gets cells into it 
- TREAT: empiric antibiotics

necrotizing fasciiitis
- very painful erythema/edema "dusky or hemorrhage"
	- necrotic/gangrene!!!
- TREAT: surg debridement + IV antibiotics 

pyoderma gangernosum - **not infectious but really mistaken for it a lot**
- dx of exclusion - exclude all infections then get this 
- reactive neutrophilic derm... 
- inflamatory pustules -> **large, painful ulcers with undetermined violaceous border = cribriform scar**
- pathergy -  **abnormal response to trauma, ulcerations!!!**. **another thing with pathergy is behcets** [[-SFP Immune Vasculitis I+II_Pasham]]
 ![[pyoderma gangrenosum.png|84x135]]
- TREAT: Wound care + immunosuppression 

candidiasis 
- mostly caused by c. albicans
- normal flora but become path when you get immunosuppressed, warm/moister, high skin pH 
- TREAT: topical antifungals liek fluconazole 
- perleche - mouth outside, we also got chronic paronychia - skin around nails ... sepsis - depos in the skin 
- intertrigo - reddish hanging off underbreast 
- erthematous, macerated, desquamated plaques with gray white membrane
	- **daughter or satellite lesions hanging off the bigger erythema**
- MICRO: yeast(round guys) + pseudohyphae (long boys) hangs in the cornified layers / upper epidermis 

tinea versicolor
- very common 
- hyper/hypopigmented erythmatous scaley macuoles
- trunk = oily skin 
- more common in summer
- **malassezia**
- TREAT: topical selenium sulfide, imidazoles, etc. 
- spaghetti + meatballs seen in stratum corneum 

dermatophytosis
