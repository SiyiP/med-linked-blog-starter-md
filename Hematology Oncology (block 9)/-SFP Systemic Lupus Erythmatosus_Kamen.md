![[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus_Kamen_PPT-Updated (1).pdf]]

prototype autoimmune dz - with a vast array of autoantibodies, protean manifestations, variable behavior
this is clinically unpredictable with flares + remissions, high health disparities, presenting with constitutional symptoms 
- this causes delayed dx ): can be 6-7 yrs after onset of symptoms 
and in virtually any body in the body 

Causes of death 1. Infection 2. Renal failure 3. Cardiovascular disease 4. Diffuse central nervous system involvement

highest risk - women in reproductive years 9:1 
family hx of SLE = 14-20x with first degree relatives
higher incidence and severity esp in childhood with black, asian, hispanic + native american ppl 
- in 20s for black women 

genetic factors - concordance of <50% in monozygotic twins, HLA associated, inherited complement deficiencies
there's like 200+ lupus risk genes, **3 pathways but incomplete penetrance for all:** 
- innate immunity - TLRs + IFNs to viruses 
- cellular homeostasis - like clearing out apoptotic cells, like for instance trigger of UV exposure -> exposed skin cell dna that need to be cleared, so immune system tries to clear it out 
- adaptive immunity - b cell targets can be hyperproliferative and stuff 

nongenetic = drugs like procainamide + hydralazine, estrogen, UV light(sunburn exposure), cig smoking, pollutants, stress, epigenetics

immunologic factors. - 
- upreg IFN inducible genes "IFN signature", B cell hyperactivity, t-cell signaling problems 

mechanisms of tissue injury - some of onset of **lupus-specific autoantibody production or immune dysreg can be *years* before onset of symptoms**
- immune complex deposition (type 3 hypersensitvitiy)
- antibodies against cells (type 2 hypersensitivity / autoantibody mediated)
- antiphospholipid syndrome - venous + arterial thrombosis

dx of SLE is complex with classification rules
- note , the criteria and classification will expand and sophosticate and change over time!! **nowadays we have weighted criteria.** 
- entry criteria: ANA titer > 1:80 you can get dx with renal biopsy showing the damage straight up 
	- negative ANA test = can *technically still have lupus* **but on my test it's a no
	- if poz - indirect IF test for ANAs - 
		- can also be other autoimmune dz, infections, aging, family hx other things 
		- [[-HRR Introduction to Clinical Immunological Tests_Litwin]]
		- ![[anca patterns.png]] - hote homogenous stuff
		- **Anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith** are also common in lupus dx 
		- 1/2 lupus pts have IgG and igM antibodies, slightly elevated levels, which will react with antiphospholipin abs, anti-b2 glycoprotein I abs....  -> false poz for syphilis bc anticardiolipin 
		- **antiphospholipid syndrome: thrombosis + AE in pregnancy**
		- lupus anticoagulant - we see in vitro prolonging of clotting that is associated with hypercoag state!!! 
- also **fever** without cause is now a classification factor 
- C3/4 being more low also has more weight 

clinically - we mainly have hematologic menifestations + 80=90% of ppl have arhtritis/inflammatory joing involvement
- small joints, bilateral, symmetrical similar to rheumatoid arthritis. worse in the morning / period of rest, **gets better with movement**
- but myalgia is on there too, joint involvement is very common + tendonitis common too in sle. 
-  = we have lack of fixed deformities + erosions in Xrays!!! [[-SFP Autoimmune Diseases I+II_Baker Frost]]
- in sle = we have non-erosive arthritis
- also hair / skin manifestations are huge - photosensitivity + alopecia , malar butterfly rash + preferential involvement of sun exposed areas. 
	- spares the nasolabial folds + doesn't get in them = this is what separates it from eczema 

skin manifestations - get a biopsy if there's anything unusual
- interface dermatitis - **basal layer of epidermis vacuolar degen there** + direct immunofluorescence shows depo of immunoglobulin along the dermal/epidermal junction 
- discoid rash - **scarring is there with chronic cutaneous lupus**
- gangrene of toes - secondary to lupus vasculitis [[-SFP Immune Vasculitis I+II_Pasham]]

kidney involvements ): often fatal , more likely in younger, african american, male patients. 
- proliferative glomerulonephritis common
- look for proteinuria "foamy urine"
- catch this early, esp with kidney biopsies - **we do have good treatments for this, a lot of immune suppression**
	subepithelial = deposits seen, podocyte injury, leaking protein into the urine
	subendothelial - deposits are there, , which makes inflammatory cells get recruited from seeing that endothelial injury 
	immune expansion to the basement membrane in between

lupus glomerulonephritis ISN/RPS classification 
- Class I – Normal by light microscopy • normal glomerulus 
- Class II – Mesangial proliferative • inc mesangiaum - black immune complexes are in there, seen mesangial deposits there, in the interglomerular cells. 
- Class III – Focal Proliferative, ***<50% glomeruli*** •can see inc BP, clot risk , subepithelial + subendothelial deposits + higher grade proteinuria ; **segmental proliferative lesions seen with some necrosis of karyorrhectic debris** 
	-  masson's stain shows the fibrin
	- glomerular crescents seen too 
	- **massive subendothelial immune complex deposits = WIRE LOOPs**
	- full house immunoflorescence - nothing else that really gives you that except for Lupus glomerulonephritis! 
- Class IV – Diffuse Proliferative, ***>50% glomeruli*** • can see inc BP, clot risk, subepithelial + subendothelial deposits + higher grade proteinuria  , ; **segmental proliferative lesions seen with some necrosis of karyorrhectic debris** 
	- masson's stain shows the fibrin
	- glomerular crescents seen too 
	- **massive subendothelial immune complex deposits = WIRE LOOPs**
	- full house immunoflorescence - nothing else that really gives you that except for Lupus glomerulonephritis! 
- Class V - Membranous • podocytes impacted, leaky kidneys giving you over 3 g of protein in urine every day - high grade proteinuria , on a **silver stain we see SPIKEs of the basement membrane from immune depos** 
	- subepithelial deposites predominate, but there's also subendothelial + mesangial deposits 
	- full house pattern too - like very stringy ish on the IF 
- Class VI – Diffuse sclerosing (>90% of the glomeruli globally sclerotic) - so much scarring is already there ):

basement membrane is in between these guys ^^

other manifestations of serocitis - general term for accumulation of **fluid around organs**
- pleurititis - common, chest pain pleuritic, when they take a deep breath, eval for pleural effusion, pleural rub 
- pericarditis - relieved by leaning forwards, eval for pericardial effusion 
- myocarditis - from subclinical to severe 
- costochondritis - localized around the sternum - can be treated more locally with nsaids, if you push on the chest it hurts 
- **pulm embolism - higher risk with antiphospholipid antibodies**
- atherosclerosis, risk of CAD inc 50x in younger ppl, and 10x higher risk of MI in young women 
**libman-sacks endocarditis = aseptic, we see vegetations on the mitral valve, they break off can cause infarctions!!**
- antiphospholipids make this more common 

other clinical manifestations - less specific
- fever, fatigue, weight loss 
---
TREAT:
- distinguish - what can we treat and what's the dmg already done? 
- give hydroxychloroquine -antimalarial, unless CI which is rare, to address and suppress flares 
	- this is to **target TLRs, innate immune system, to dampen it down**
- also give corticosteroids - **only as a bridge between other therapies at lowest effective dose**
- reduce/remove modded environmental triggers
- lower risk of bone dz, osteoporosis screen + prevention 
- get vaccines!!! influenza, pneumococcal, zoster, hpv, covid19 
- screen for + RF reduction with CVD, kidney, blood clots, sleep disorders \
