framework
![[WBC neoplasm framework]]
leukemia - from the bone marrow - progression marked by abnormal cells in blood + bone marrow- extended to peripheral blood - 
- classified acute - immautre blasts - block in stem cell maturation/differentiations = leading to neoplastic blasts. 
- chronic = mature cells = block occurs later on in development 
- myeloid or lymphoid cells arise from these 
	- myeloid - think everything that's not like lymphocytes like t/b/nk cells. 
- normal bone marrow taken over by leukemic cells -> **cytopenias in peripheral blood, but WBC can be circulating increase!** - 
	- normal circularity % in bone marrow: 100-age, basically fat increases in your bone marrow with time. = **first order is in core bone marrow biopsy + aspirate**
	- are we cytopenic bc we have a malignancy in the bone marrow, or nothing there / aplastia 
lymphomas - arises in lymphoid tissue, like lymph nodes, spleen , thymus .... appear as tumors/masses
both leukemia and lymphomas are the similar in cell type j difference in where it comes from 

acute myeloid leukemia
- acute leukemia - 20%+ blasts in **peripheral blood OR bone marrow**
	- normal peripheral has no blasts
- signs + symptoms - cytopenias = bone marrow failure, thrombocytopenia (bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses), anemia, neutropenia 
- b-symptoms - fever night sweats, weight loss, bone pain, splenomeg, hepatomeg, etc. 
	- aleukemic leukemia - blasts trapped in marrow and don't make it to periphery 
myeloid blast. - **larger than lymphoid blasts, 3-4x size of rbc** more common - nucleolus + cytoplasmic granules 
- **auer rods - fused lysosomes ONLY THING DX of MYELOID LINEAGE!**
- AML - acute myeloid leukemia - has way more categories with different prognoses and stuff - these is clinically significant to subcategorize them into **genetic abnormalities or differentiation (what cell do the leukemias most look like), it's a very diverse dz category.**
	- APL - acute promyelocytic leukemia with PML::RARA fusion - **both have bilobed folded kidney/butterfly shaped nuclei!** - this translocation is present -> automatically APL 
		- hypergranular form - a lot of cyt and a ton of granules and auer rods
		- microgranular - fewer and sometimes no visible cyt granules and few rods 
		- ***this causes DIC!*** they all express tissue factor + annexin to breakdown fibrin 
		- this hybrid protein PML/RARA will block transcription/diff of granulocytes and stops it from getting mature. 
		- poz - CD117, CD33, CD13, neg for CD34, HLA-DR
		- TREAT: **with all-trans retinoic acid ATRA EARLY!!!! = good prognosis** to induce differentiation + reducing DIC risk. also arsenic 
	- monocytic lineage - 80% of leukemic cells in AML: acute monocytic leukemia 
		- monoblasts - round neucleus, visible/proominent nucleosis 
		- promonocytes - indented/folded nuc + less prominent nucleoli 
		- on the cells immunophenotype they have : CD4, CD14, CD64 
		- stain for nonspecific esterase = **monocytic lineage**
		- **they can relocate to the gums, gingival hypertrophy - huge extramedullary involvement**
	- AEL - acute erythroid leukemia - 30+% , are immature erythroid cells erythroblasts
		- round nuclei, agranular basophilic cytoplasm, cytomasmic vacuoles 
		- bone marrow has predominance of these
		- PAS+ stain, pink stain
		- has glycophorin + CD71 on the surface
	- acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
		- **associated with down syndrome/trisomy 21**
		- 20%+ blasts in bone marrow/blood, medium to large, **cytoplasmic blebs**
		- PAS+ stain
		- one or more of platelet glycoproteins CD41, CD61, CD42b 
favorable prognosis - acute promyelocytic leukemia w PML::RARA fusion 15;17, basically 50% have long term dz free survival! 15-30% overall survival
bad prognosis - amls associated with myelodysplasia/late complications of cytotoxic therapies given for another disease = bad. 
- alkylating drugs, ionizing radiation etc. 

other prognostic factors in AML if no specific gene translocation 
- look for mutations in FLT3 and NPM1 gene
	- FLT3 = **mutation is a cytokine, worse prognosis**
	- NPM1 = **protein if mutated, good prognosis**
	- if poz for both, it's intermediate
TREAT: chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, ATRA for APL 

lymphoid blasts
- can be smaller, sometimes there's cytoplasmic granules 
common traits 
- nuc:cyt ratio smooth appearance in most blasts.
---
myelodysplastic syndrome - MDS. 
- **clonal hematopoietic stem cell dz - dysplasia in 1+ hematopoietic cell, at least 10% of total cells**
- ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias 
- inc risk to DEVELOP into acute myeloid leukemia 
MDS - typically in older adults but rare in younger
- risk - higher to progress into AML with inc % of blasts
- **Biallelic TP53 inactivation = very poor prognosis + very aggressive**
- more complex cytogenic abnormalities = worse prognosis 
- symptoms - CBC 1+ cytopenias and also symptoms associated. 
dysplasia in bone marrow how to define? 
- 10% of it in a particular lineage show dysplastic features
- in erythroid + granulocytic cells = look at the bone marrow aspirate slides
- in megakaryotic cells - look at core biopsy slides 
- 50-70% of MDS has at least 1 cytogenetic abnormality, **most common loss of 5 or 7 chromosome.** 
- gene mutations: **dna mehtylation, histones, rna splicing and transcription**
	- peripheral blood smear - shows up in the neutrophils usually - shows up abnormally hypogranular, hyposegmentation
	- platelets - thrombocytopenia, large platelets
	- macrocytic anemia with MDS! + anisopoikilocytosis with RBCs 
-  RBC precursors we can see dysplasia in bone marrow
	- nuclear budding (flower nuclei)
	- karyorrhexis - nuclei blowing up completingly 
	- megaloblastic change - cell too large for what stage it's in like if it's a darker red, it's too large 
	- ring sideroblasts seen in iron stain 
- dysplasia: granulocytes
	- hypogranularity, hypo/hypersegmentation, alterations in size, abnormally large granules
	- auer rods - seen in blasts and rarely in more mature granulocytes 
- dysplastic megakaryocytes
	- micromegakaryocytes = too small
	- nuclear hypolobation = **they normally have a very big complex fuzzy nucleus but in these abnormal ones they just have 2 uniform widely separated nuclear lobes.**
MDS - classification - not critical to memorize all the terminology for subcategorization 
- key - inc number of blasts = more aggressive and worse prognosis . auer rods. = will always make the disease more serious and bump down the prognosis to worse
- we newly have separate categories for pts with separate genetic abnormalities
