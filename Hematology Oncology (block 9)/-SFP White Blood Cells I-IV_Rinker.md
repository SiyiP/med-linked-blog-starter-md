WBC-related notes from test:
potential helpful: 
CD 1920s = think Bs 
CD 5,7,4,8 single numbers = think Ts 
Myeloid numbers are in 3s, 13,30,etc

- polycythemia vera (markedly elevated hematocrit, suppressed erythropoietin. Most cases of polycythemia demonstrate a JAK2 mutation. 
- LAP score measures the activity of alkaline phosphatase in leukocytes; 
	- a low score was historically indicative of CML and higher score consistent with leukemoid reactions. 
- Howell Jolly bodies are nuclear remnants in erythrocytes, often seen in aplenic patients (spleen normally would remove red cells with   
- The TRAP stain (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) stains the TRAP enzyme causing the cytoplasm to be red and granular; it is relatively unique to hairy cell leukemia vs. other leukemias.

multiple myeloma
rouleaux formation of the RBC's, and the clinical history documents multiple "CRAB" criteria (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions), highly suspicious for plasma cell myeloma. 
- Serum protein electrophoresis will detect monoclonal immunoglobulin produced by the neoplastic plasma cells.

A 4-year-old female presents abruptly with petechiae, bruising, fatigue, and bone pain.  The white blood cell count is elevated with 60% blasts.  By flow cytometry the blasts are positive for CD19 and CD10.  The lineage of the blasts is: - precursor b cells
- This is a case of B‐ALL. 
- B‐lymphoblasts express **CD19 and CD10 (also known at CALLA – common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen)**. 
- Classic T cell markers are CD3, 4, and 8. 
- Myeloid markers include CD13 and 33 
- classic monocytic markers are CD14, 64, 68 

for testing: 
- Flow cytometry can easily discriminate the clonal CD5, CD23 positive B‐ cells with immunoglobulin light chain restriction of CLL from non‐ neoplastic lymphocytes. 
- TdT staining screens for T-cell **lymphoblastic** lymphoma. 
- Myeloperoxidase stains mark a **myeloid** lineage of cell type. 
- Coombs testing detects antibodies that can cause hemolysis of red cells.

mantle cell lymphoma (CD5+, CD23‐) -  **protein overexpressed is cyclin D1.** 
- usually results from **t(11;14)**,  which connects the cyclin D1 gene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene segments. Cyclin D1 regulates the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to the S phase.

Burkitt lymphomas have a high proliferative index as manifested by high Ki‐67. The starry sky appearance results from pale macrophages containing tumor debris ('tingible body macrophages') scattered amongst the dark lymphoma tumor cell background.
Reactive germinal centers have tangible body macrophages, polarization, follicular dendritic cells, numerous mitotic figures, and cellular polymorphism.
- (8;14) translocation (involving the myc). 
- positive for CD10 (CALLA) but not CD5 (which is commonly positive in chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma).

- but follicular lymphoma has no tingible body macrophages
- Normal germinal cells **do not express BCL2,** an anti‐apoptotic protein. *In follicular lymphoma, the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is translocated next to the BCL2 gene*, resulting in overexpression and inhibition of apoptosis.
- follicular lymphoma - (14;18), paratrabecular aggregates of CD20+ B cells
|Benign, reactive germinal centers show polarization (separation of dark and light-staining areas) and contain tingible body macrophages. Normal germinal center B cells are positive for CD10 and negative for bcl-2. Follicular lymphoma shows absent polarization and decreased/absent tingible body macrophages; neoplastic B cells are positive for CD10 and aberrantly express bcl-2.|   

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis - we see fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and DIC after a viral infection
- Very high serum ferritin levels are seen in HLH. 
- hyperviscocity syndrome

Auer rods are seen in AML.
- acute promyelocytic leukemia - DIC and a white count of 150,000. The white blood cells are immature and have numerous Auer rods. This diagnosis is confirmed by FISH for t(15;17). If positive, the patient should be treated with ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) as it induces the maturation of the immature promyelocytes, reducing the leukemic burden, targets the PML/RAR fusion protein and resolves coagulopathy.

A bone marrow biopsy in an older patient showing a hypercellular marrow with dysplasia in all three hematopoietic cell lines (erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic) strongly supports the diagnosis of MDS.  Patients with MDS are at higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia

a classic presentation of CML - Left shifted granulocytes indicated the presence of immature granulocytes (myeloid lineage) in the peripheral blood. This can be seen in infections, but a 150,000 white cell count is a leukemic process.  Demonstration of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) confirms the diagnosis. splenomegaly and a white count of 150,000. The granulocytes are left shifted and there is a basophilia. 2% blasts are present.
- chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) which is characterized by t(9;22) which produces the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. First-line treatment for CML utilizes a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets BCR-ABL1 (imatinib).

The lymphocytes in CLL look very much like normal lymphocytes. One can determine clonality by surface immunoglobulin light chain restriction. Expression of CD5 and CD23 on the clonal B-cells is classic for CLL.

framework
![[WBC neoplasm framework]]
leukemia - from the bone marrow - progression marked by abnormal cells in blood + bone marrow- extended to peripheral blood - 
- classified acute - immautre blasts - block in stem cell maturation/differentiations = leading to neoplastic blasts. **blocked maturation**
- chronic = mature cells = block occurs later on in development 
- myeloid or lymphoid cells arise from these 
	- myeloid - think everything that's not like lymphocytes like t/b/nk cells. 
- normal bone marrow taken over by leukemic cells -> **cytopenias in peripheral blood, but WBC can be circulating increase!** - 
	- normal circularity % in bone marrow: 100-age, basically fat increases in your bone marrow with time. = **first order is in core bone marrow biopsy + aspirate**
	- are we cytopenic bc we have a malignancy in the bone marrow, or nothing there / aplastia 
lymphomas - arises in lymphoid tissue, like lymph nodes, spleen , thymus .... appear as tumors/masses
both leukemia and lymphomas are the similar in cell type j difference in where it comes from 

acute myeloid leukemia
- acute leukemia - 20%+ blasts in **peripheral blood OR bone marrow**
	- normal peripheral has no blasts
- signs + symptoms - cytopenias = bone marrow failure, thrombocytopenia (bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses), anemia, neutropenia 
- b-symptoms - fever night sweats, weight loss, bone pain, splenomeg, hepatomeg, etc. 
	- aleukemic leukemia - blasts trapped in marrow and don't make it to periphery 
myeloid blast. - **larger than lymphoid blasts, 3-4x size of rbc** more common - nucleolus + cytoplasmic granules 
- **auer rods - fused lysosomes ONLY THING DX of MYELOID LINEAGE!**
- AML - acute myeloid leukemia - has way more categories with different prognoses and stuff - these is clinically significant to subcategorize them into **genetic abnormalities or differentiation (what cell do the leukemias most look like), it's a very diverse dz category.**
	- APL - acute promyelocytic leukemia with PML::RARA fusion - **both have bilobed folded kidney/butterfly shaped nuclei!** - this translocation is present -> automatically APL 
		- hypergranular form - a lot of cyt and a ton of granules and auer rods
		- microgranular - fewer and sometimes no visible cyt granules and few rods 
		- ***this causes DIC!*** they all express **tissue factor to induce coagulation + annexin** , generates plasmin to breakdown fibrin 
		- DIC etiology - STOP making trouble. sepsis/snakebites, trauma, obsterics, liver/pancreatitis, Malignancy , 
		- this hybrid protein PML/RARA will block transcription/diff of granulocytes and stops it from getting mature. 
			- cells get stuck in that immature phase , so if you give ATRA, they continue to mature and stuff. 
		- poz - CD117, CD33, CD13, neg for CD34, HLA-DR
		- TREAT: **with all-trans retinoic acid ATRA EARLY!!!! = good prognosis** to induce differentiation + reducing DIC risk. also arsenic 
			- differentiation syndrome = happens after treatment as a complication
	- monocytic lineage - 80% of leukemic cells in AML: acute monocytic leukemia 
		- monoblasts - round neucleus, visible/proominent nucleosis 
		- promonocytes - indented/folded nuc + less prominent nucleoli 
		- on the cells immunophenotype they have : CD4, CD14, CD64 
		- stain for nonspecific esterase = **monocytic lineage**
		- **they can relocate to the gums, gingival hypertrophy - huge extramedullary involvement**
	- AEL - acute erythroid leukemia - 30+% , are immature erythroid cells erythroblasts
		- round nuclei, agranular basophilic cytoplasm, cytomasmic vacuoles 
		- bone marrow has predominance of these
		- PAS+ stain, pink stain
		- has glycophorin + CD71 on the surface
	- acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
		- **associated with down syndrome/trisomy 21**
		- 20%+ blasts in bone marrow/blood, medium to large, **cytoplasmic blebs**
		- PAS+ stain
		- one or more of platelet glycoproteins CD41, CD61, CD42b 
favorable prognosis - acute promyelocytic leukemia w PML::RARA fusion 15;17, basically 50% have long term dz free survival! 15-30% overall survival
	t(8;21), t(16;16), and t(15;17)
bad prognosis - amls associated with myelodysplasia/late complications of cytotoxic therapies given for another disease = bad. 
- alkylating drugs, ionizing radiation etc. 

other prognostic factors in AML if no specific gene translocation 
- look for mutations in FLT3 and NPM1 gene
	- FLT3 = **mutation is a cytokine, worse prognosis**
	- NPM1 = **protein if mutated, good prognosis**
	- if poz for both, it's intermediate
TREAT: chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, ATRA for APL 

lymphoid blasts
- can be smaller, sometimes there's cytoplasmic granules 
common traits 
- nuc:cyt ratio smooth appearance in most blasts.
---
myelodysplastic syndrome - MDS. 
- **clonal hematopoietic stem cell dz - dysplasia in 1+ hematopoietic cell, at least 10% of total cells**
- *ineffective* hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias 
- inc risk to DEVELOP into acute myeloid leukemia 
MDS - typically in older adults but rare in younger
- risk - higher to progress into AML with inc % of blasts
- **Biallelic TP53 inactivation = very poor prognosis + very aggressive**
- more complex cytogenic abnormalities = worse prognosis 
- symptoms - CBC 1+ cytopenias and also symptoms associated. 
dysplasia in bone marrow how to define? 
- 10% of it in a particular lineage show dysplastic features
- in erythroid + granulocytic cells = look at the bone marrow aspirate slides
- in megakaryotic cells - look at core biopsy slides 
- 50-70% of MDS has at least 1 cytogenetic abnormality, **most common loss of 5 or 7 chromosome.** 
- gene mutations: **dna mehtylation, histones, rna splicing and transcription**
	- peripheral blood smear - shows up in the neutrophils usually - shows up abnormally hypogranular, hyposegmentation
	- platelets - thrombocytopenia, large platelets
	- macrocytic anemia with MDS! + anisopoikilocytosis with RBCs 
-  RBC precursors we can see dysplasia in bone marrow
	- nuclear budding (flower nuclei)
	- karyorrhexis - nuclei blowing up completingly 
	- megaloblastic change - cell too large for what stage it's in like if it's a darker red, it's too large 
	- ring sideroblasts seen in iron stain 
- dysplasia: granulocytes
	- hypogranularity, hypo/hypersegmentation, alterations in size, abnormally large granules
	- auer rods - seen in blasts and rarely in more mature granulocytes 
- dysplastic megakaryocytes
	- micromegakaryocytes = too small
	- nuclear hypolobation = **they normally have a very big complex fuzzy nucleus but in these abnormal ones they just have 2 uniform widely separated nuclear lobes.**
MDS - classification - not critical to memorize all the terminology for subcategorization 
- key - inc number of blasts = more aggressive and worse prognosis . auer rods. = will always make the disease more serious and bump down the prognosis to worse
- we newly have separate categories for pts with separate genetic abnormalities 



![[Neoplastic White Blood Cells II-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Immature Lymphoid Neoplasms_Rinker_PPT (1).pdf]]
myelo*proliferative* neoplasms 
- effective maturation, but **abnormally low apoptosis**, but high proliferation. 
- underlying etiology - still a clonal stem cell disorder , but are characterized by **EFFECTIVE maturation** in the bone marrow instead of ineffective like in MDS
	- bone marrow - hypercellular, increased amount of myeloid lineages 
- peripheral blood has cytosis - more type of cells - **unlike MDS, where you end up with cytopenias** peripherally
- associated with translocations/point mutations 
	- activated tyrosine kinase receptors+**tyrosine pathways in general**
	- enhanced expression of proteins participating in anti-apoptotic pathways 
common features - they all **have the potential to permeate at the same end point. - termination of bone marrow failure**: happens via fibrosis, ineffective hematopoiesis, transformation to acute leukemia. 
- CML - chronic myeloid leukemia - most common, predom in adults, but can be in kids
	- 20-40% asymptomatic but fatigue, weight loss, bone pain, splenomegaly, night sweats
	- labs - CBC - usually leukocytosis , 
	- BEST TEST DX: **t(9;22) BCR-ABL1** - enhanced tyrosine kinase activity of BCR/ABL1 causing constitutive activity -> proliferation 
		- PCR monitoring most sensitive 
		- note - this protein is a fusion protein but many different types can be made with sqme translocation - this is on the larger side bigger than the one in ALL. 
	- low LAP score - not in our tests
	- dz course - chronic -> accerlerated -> blast phase 
		- chronic phase - in periphery, we see leukocytosis, <10% blasts, no dysplasia, basphilia, and granulocytosis at all stages of maturation - left shift, basophilia (throwback, no benign causes of basophilia), thrombocytosis too -
			- hypercellular bone marrow , granulocytes in all stages of maturation, more myeloid than rbc 
			- **dwarf megakaryocytes seen**
			- blasts <10%
			- TREAT: tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs - imatinib 
		- accerlerated phase - <20% blasts, but more. evidence of disease progression **in spite of treatment** = with inc wbc, thrombocytopenia or cytosis, bone marrow **fibrosis**, additional genetic abnormalities
			- TREAT: switch to diff TKI 
		- blast phase >20% blasts in periphery or marrow - basically acute myeloid leukemia, but we still consider it part of the CML spectrum ; **25% of these blasts proliferating are acute lymphoblasts instead; acute lymphoblastic leukemias B>>T** -> thought that the genetic abnormalities build up on an even earlier phase  
			- treat as acute leukemia if all other TKI fail + bone marrow transplant 
- polycythemia vera - primary issue = inc rbc prod independent of normal mechanisms
	- hyperviscosity like headaches, dizziness, flushing, redness, htn, thrombosis 
	- PLATELET dysfunction + pruitis **after bathing** bc temp increase leads to mast cell degranulation. inc in other types of cells 
	- **JAK2 mutation poz in 95% of cases = activating tyrosine kinase!**
		- this pathway is always active even when not binded with erythropoietin 
	- bone marrow = **hypercellularity of all 3 cell lines**, no dysplasia (effective normal maturation unlike MDS), iron stores decreased 
	- progression - spent phase = marrow is fibrotic, -> acute myeloid leukemia up to 20% ppl 
	- TREAT: phlembotomy + antithrombotics like aspirin, JAK2 inhibitors too 
	- prognosis - good survival 10+ yrs .... death from thrombosis/hemorrhage
- secondary polycythemia - underlying process, not neoplastic but **physiologically appropriate**
	- chronic pulm/cv dz
	- high o2 affinity hemoblogbinopathy 
	- inc carboxyhb with smoking and methb , or resistance at high altitude
	- **physiologically inappropriate** - adrenal cortical hypersecretion, hydronephrosis with inc erythropoietin, or tumor making erythropoietin
	- relative polycythemia - meaning decreased plasma volume, like if you lose lots of fluids, recall ur hematocrit's a ratio, so it'll look bigger
essential thrombocythemia -
- abnormally high platelet production - some abnormally large. 
- clinical findings = giant platelets close in size with red cell
- 50+% are asymptomatic, but we might see thrombosis + hemorrhage
- JAK2 mutations + CALR, MPL mutations all jakstat pathway 
- bone marrow = see staghorn nuclei hypersegmented megakarycytes which are also a bigger number now 
- TREAT: antithrombotics + jak2 inhib
- progression - spent phase after years, marrow gets fibrotic. and progression happens to acute myeloid leukemia , **but this is lowest risk, <5%**
- prognosis - good typically peaceful with some interruptions of thrombotic episodes

primary myelofibrosis - prolif of granulocytes and megakaryocytes with depo of fibrosis 
- like 30% + asymptmatic but you get abdominal pain, thrombosis, hemorrhage, splenomegaly 
- peripheral blood - some left shift, 
	- early: inc platelets + wbc
	- late: cytopenias, tear drop RBCs, leukoerythroblastic with left granulocytes + nucleated rbcs 
- JAK2, CALR, MPL
- bone marrow: 
	- pre-fibrotic / cellular phase: hypercellular marrow, inc granulocytes + inc/abnormal **clustered circular lobed megakaryocytes**
	- fibrotic phase - inc fibrosis + **atypical megakaryocytes too**
	- prognosis - worse, 3-7 yrs fibrosis, death from bone marrow failure like hemorrhage/infection, 30% get AML
	TREAT: antithrombotics, JAK2 inhib, transplant

immature lymphoid neoplasms 
maturation block after hematopoietic stem cell has chosen to become lymphoid 
- all start in bone marrow then travel to blood then the periphery with b to the lymph nodes, t to the thymus 
precursor b cell neoplasms - broken down due to the lineage/genetic abnormalities 
B-ALL - **b lymphoblastic leukemia**
- most common malignancy of kids
- 20+% blasts in peripheral blod + bone marrow
- abrupt onset: fatigue, fever, bleeding, prolonged infection, bone pain, CNS involvement (**blasts will go into the nervous system)** lymphadenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly
- peripheral blood : has leukocytosis with lymphoblasts - huge - 
- bone marrow - hypercellular, sheets of lymphoblasts replacing ; don't tend to happen in lymph nodes
- morphology - **t and b the same blasts** - intermeiate in size, **very high nuc:cyt ratio!!1 scant agranular cytoplasm, no auer rods**
	- not always possible to tell them apart based on morphology - look at genetics 
- prognosis - overall good, but things associated with worse:
	- very young <2 yrs, older age 10+ yrs
	- high wbc at dx, and **philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)** - same thing in CML
	- better prognosis with hyperdiploidy 
THE BEST WAY TO TELL APART IN ACUTE LEUKEMIAS
- **flow cytometry - you can test for markers**
	- Immaturity markers: CD34, TdT, HLA-DR - 35 and TdT = **not as specific but tells you that it's a blast**
	- b cell line - **CD19**, CD22, **CD79a**
	- usually poz for CD10 
- lymphoblast - **PAS stain**
- myeloblasts: MPO, SBB, chloroacetate esterase CAE, NSE nonspecific esterase 

T-ALL t lymphoblastic leukemias
- 15% of childhood ALLs = more common in adolescents 
- 20+% blasts in peripheral and/or bone marrow - can happen in both lymph nodes (**lymphomas**) and bone marrow
	- makes mediastinal mass with thymus involvement - 
- leukocytosis w/ lymphoblasts, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia all in periphery 
- flow cyt
	- markers; CD34, TdT imaturity 
	- T lineage - CD3, CD2, CD5, CD7 = **in the thymus they get CD4 and CD8... this is why we might have these! or both or neither!!!!**
- cytochem stains = lymphoblasts - PAS 
- cytogenetics - no major associations 

![[Neoplastic White Blood Cells III-Mature Small B-Cell Neoplasms_Rinker_PPT (1).pdf]]
lymphomas - they are all clonal - from a genetically aberrant common cell that duplicates
- lymphadenopathy/or mass formation - mediastinum, gi tract, and skin. 
- some spill out into the bone marrow and are detected in peripheral blood = "leukemic phase"
- b cell lymphomas are more!!! 
- cell surface markers. = **critical for diagnosis! and flow cyt + immunohistochem**
- anything that disrupts immune system predisposes to lymphomas - like immunosuppressive drugs + HIV/AIDs

normal b cell dev
- they all progenitors happen from lymphoblasts of bone marrow = VDJ recomb
- leave bone marrow - mature but naive b-cells ; just igM 
- enter germinal center of lymph nodes - get clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation, class switching from igM to IgG/A, differentiation into memory and plasma cells
	- should undergo apoptosis here if any hang ups happen
- leave follicles and going to marginal zone or whatever other part of body
normally - mature b lymphocytes - have **kappa or lamda proteins, normal kappa:lambda ratio: 2-3:1**
- normally we have a mix of kappa poz and lambda poz cells - seen in flow cytometry 
- **b cell neoplasms are IDENTICAL - light chain restriction, monotypic, all kappa or all lambda**
	- they also show aberrant antigen expression - like antigens that normal b cells don't: in mantle cell lymphoma, CD5(typically on t cells), cyclin D1 
	- Kappa light chain restriction , meaning distribution of kappa/lamda is polyploidal ... Basically green stays one side, other color stays on other side etc
		- there's a cutoff, above the line and below , we can see if it's CD10 poz or below the line.
		- we keep that in green = the cells we've isolated and we're checking for. 


mature b-cell neoplasms - a ton of these
low grade ones: 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia - CLL - leukocytosis w/ lymphocytosis **in peripheral blood** ; inc. mature monotypic b cells with CLL immunophenotype  ; cracked earth snickerdoodle 

small lymphocytic lymphoma - SLL - lymphadenopathy/extranodal tumor formation, more confined to lymph node - mature monotypic b cells still, with CLL 
- these both - usually male, middle to elderly 
- asymptomatic might be, b-symptoms, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hypogammaglobulinemia ... see lymphocytosis , anemia, thrombocytopenia
- see: **small lymphocytes, scant, agranular cyt, round nuclei, exagerrated heterogenous appearance: SOCCER BALLs, cracked earth appearance.**
	- also smudge cells. - fragililty here, squashed lymphocytes 
	- soccer ball/cracked earth 
- in lymph nodes - when there's SLL
	- diffuse effacement of norm lymph node architecture - basically we don't see germinal centers etc folliles, just homogenous mix... sheets of small lymphocytes w same appearance as CLL 
	- "pale areas" = proliferation centers, bsically these lymphocytes with more cytoplasm, **bc mitotic activity is taking place**
- involvement of bone marrow
	- aspirate smear - small lymphocytes similar to periphery 
	- core biopsy - **nodular ymphoid aggregates or diffuse sheets of lymphocytes**
- immunophenotype - poz for mature b cell normal markers - CD19, 20, 22, Pax-5, CD79 
- monotypic surface immunoglobulin (weak) - like kappa and lambda
- usually pertinent poz - CD5/CD23 for the CLL/SLL
- pert. negative - CD10, cyclin-D1, FMC7 
- genetic standpoint - no dx translation, but there's common mutations
	- prognosis good with deletion 13q 
	- prognosis bad with deletion 11, 17p
- can be managed, but canonot be cured. unless people are monitored for disease 
- prognosis very bad when it transforms into large cell diffuse lymphoma 

mantle cell lymphoma - more aggro than CLL
- mature b cell lymphoma = translocation - (11;14) - basically IGH gene on chromosome 14 , and bcl1/cyclin d1 on 11,, leading to **upregulation of cyclin d1**
- median age 60 yrs, male>female
- asymptomatic, lymph, etc, **GI mucosal involvement, we see polyps.... lymphomatoid polyposis - little nodules of lymphoma LOOKs like polyps**
	- regular small lymphocytes 
	- nodular, expanded (with preservation of germinal centers)
	- diffuse,
	- pwith some bone marrow involvement in aggresvie dz  
- same b cell markers - cd19, cd20, cd22, cd79a, pax-5
	- **monotypic surface strong immunoglobulin; basically expresses above ones stronger**
	- aberrant poz - cd5, cyclin-d1, fmc7 
	- pertinent neg - cd10 
	- lambda restricted profile 
- genetics - (11;14) ;; and detect with fluorescence i nsitu, fish 
- more aggro than cll/sll, but doesn't transform into dlbcl 

**follicular lymphoma** - comprised of germinal center derived b cells
- **(14;18) - the immunoglobulin heavy gene is changed,** 
- **BCL-2** overexpression (apoptotic protein) gene on 18 and IGH gene on 14... 
- median age 60 yrs both gender
- asymptomatic, b symptoms, lymphadenopathy - 
- we see paleness
- nodular pattern, folliular - **back to back foollicles with expanded germinal centers**
	- in middle - we see lack of macrophages - they are filled with centroocytes (small) and centroblasts
	- grade lymphomas = more centroblasts = worse
- only 30% bone marrow invovelemnt - hugs surface of bone
- markers -  cd19, cd20, cd22, cd79a, pax-5
	- expressed poz: CD10, BCL6, **BCL2** (aberrant , recall this is anti-apoptotic protein, can't express)
	- we can also do a stain for bcl-2 - shows up as yellow signals in these FISH
- prognosis: lower grade = longer survival, but not curable bc mature b cells (not as chemosensitive, harder to eradicate)
	- similar to CLL, might progress to diffuse large b cell lymphomas 

marginal zone lymphoma - arise from the outiside of follicles, in many areas of body 
- MALT lymphomas - extranodal marginal zone lyphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue - unique; but can appear in spleen etc. 
	- extranodal, of small heterogenous b cells
	- develop de novo or with **chronic inflammatory conditions - H pylori + hashimotos, sjogrens syndrome**
	- treating H. pylori -> resolving this potentially! 
	- female 61 yrs old mainly 
	- infiltration of small heterogenous lymphocytes - with invasion of overlying epithelial surface
		- going into gastric glands - lymphoepithelial lesions 
		- bone marrow involvement uncommon. 
		- non-specific b cell immunophenotype - don't aberrantly express cd5, cd10 = these are pertinent negatives
	- not genetically specific either, depends on site. 
	- prognosis = good , even less aggro than chemo. treat with h. pylori 

higher grade mature b lyphomas
burkitt lymphomas - 
- endemically - large jaw mass, malarial distribution in africa, brazil , new guinea, kids, 
- sporadic form - kids/young adults immunodef like HIV, we see ileocecal valve + gonads 
- lymph node architecture - loss of this, monotonous sheets of tumor cells + high prolif
	- **starry sky appearance bc inc tangible body macrophages** that are trying to clean up the other cells! 
	- avg lymphocytes - basophilic cytoplasm, cytoplasmic vacuoles, inconspicuous nucleoli
	- bone marrow involvement is frequent in immunodeficiency cases 
- germinal center differentiation - similar to follicular lymphoma - **poz for CD10**.... 
	- also poz for **Ki-67** - meaning very high proliferation index
	- **pertinent negative for Bcl-2** , which sets it apart from **follicular lymphoma which is poz for bcl-2 = this is (14;18) mutation** 
- genetics (8;14) - MYC oncogene chromosome 8, and IgH gene chromosome 14 
	- very responsive to chemo, 80-90% survival! good at curing this! 

lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma - 
- proliferation of **clonal b lymph with plasmacytic differentiation**
	- more plasmacytoid ones + clonal plasma cells
- protein electrophoresis is crucial - ppl have monolonal gammopathy in serum 
	- igM is very big, and can stick together - **hyperviscocity of blood**
	- visual, neuro impairment, renal dysfunction 
- peripheral smear/aspirate - bone marrow - involved usually!!! more leukemic presentation
	- small lymphocytes w/ minimal cyt
	- plasmacytoid lymphocytes = eccentric nuc, more cytoplasm
	- plasma cells = eccentric nuc + basophilic cytoplasm 
	- bone marrow core biopsy - usually same cells in nodular, loose or interstitial pattern with inc mast cells
- when there's rarely lymph node involvement- in paracortical, sinusoid, or diffuse, variable pattern. 
- splenic - white pulp expansion mostly 
- similar phenotype to marginal zone lymphomas - CD19, cd20, cd22, cd79a, pax5 all normal
	- negative for cd5, cd10 so nonspecific
	- plasma cells = CD138, CD38 , mum-1 
	- light chain restriction 
- **genetics = myd88 mutation!!! - essential to differentiate from marginal zone lymphoma** 
- prognosis - indolent, median survival is 5-10 yrs 

hairy cell leukemia - uncommon, older men, unique!!! 
- massive splenomegaly abdominal discomfort
- **cytopenia/pancytopenia uniquely!** - fatigue + recurrent infections! 
- peripheral blood - larger than lymphocytes
	- oval to bean shaped nuclei 
	- disperse chromatin ; more cytoplasm than others have - fried egg appearance. 
	- pale blue cytoplasm with hairs!!!
- spleens - have **red** pulp expansion , white pulp regression + blood lakes
- livers - have small lymphocyte clusters in sinuses + portals + blood lakes 
	- immunophenotype - all have cd19,20, 22, 79a, pax-5
	- **pertinent poz - traid of CD11c, CD25, CD103**
	- also poz for cyclin d1, annexin a1
	- pertinent negs cd5, cd10 
	- cytochemistry - **TRAP marker - here - red staining in cyt of hairy cells**
	- BRAF mutation. - activates this with downstream mapk, proliferation etc. **therapy with BRAF inhibitors**
- cellularity is variable in these. some people can have ***aplastic* marrow + we only see it when staining cyclin d1 or cd20**
	- also reticulin fibrosis possible 
- prognosis - responds good to BRAF inhibitors + chemotherapies

"rest of the lymphomas"
diffuse large b-cell lymphomas 
- some of the smaller ones can transform into this 
- most common non-hodgekin lymphoma
- most commonly in adults, nucleus same size or larger than a macrophage nucleus; 3x the size of normal lymphocytes
	- open/clear chromatin, visible nucleoli 
- might be de novo 
- clinically very aggro, rapidly fatal if untreated
	- chemo + rituximab anti CD20 in about 50% of cases treatable 
- mature b cell - CD19,20,22,79a, pax5
- more heterogenous than the small cell b lymphomas
	- some have germinal center differentiation cd10, bcl-6
	- or activated b-cell/non-germinal center difff = mum-1 
	- variable genetic proifle too - bcl6,2, myc too commonly trasnlocated 

hodgkin lymphoma - b cell origin
- classic hodgkin lymphoma - b cell lymphoma full of hodgkin like or HL cells and some reed-sternberg cells - scattered within a bgd of **inflammatory infiltrate - reactive/non-neoplastic**
		- HL = large, single nuc, prominent eosinophilic nucleolis 
		- **reed-sternberg RS** cells = subtype of hodgkin cell; inclusion like bi/multinuc, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli 
		- lacunar cells = HL/RS cell sitting in an empty space (retraction artifact)
		- mummified cell = degenerated HL/RS cell with nucleus appearing **smudgey**
	- nodular sclerosis - we have dense fibrotic bands dividing the lymph node into diffuse areas. ; **typically presents with slow growing, painless lymphadenopathy with a mediastinal mass**
	- mixed cellularity - relatively few large hodgkin cells with a bgd of rich eosinophils and cells with a lot of pink cytoplasm 
	- note- cervical lymphadenopathy slow grower mainly 
	- lymphocyte rich 
	- lymphocyte depleted 
	- they pertinent poz = cd30, cd15, pax-5 , +/- EBV. 
		- pertinent negatives = CD45, CD20, CD79a
	- prognosis: favorable, related to age + stage
	- TREAT: chemo + rad 
 
- **nodular lymphocyte**-predominant hodgkin/b-cell lymphoma - not biologically relatted to hodgkin lymphoma, just visually 
	- neoplastic cells = large b cells with multilobated nuclei = has **popcorn cells** + lymphocyte predominant cells .... **constituting a minority of cellular material**  similar to classic hodgkins 
	- notably mediastinal involvement less common than classic hodgkins
		- still slow growing isolated lymphadenopathy 
		- rarely : b symptoms and bone marrow invovlement + cervical mostly 
		- vaguely nodular growth pattern - we can draw some lines around some non-normal looking follicules 
	- bgd = small lymphocytes. + histiocytes
	- less common than classic, more males, 
	- prognosis: VERY good esp just one lymph node involved, but recurrence is common 
		- poor factors = diffuse growth pattern, spleen involvement, high stage
	- immunophenotype - LH 
		- RETAIN expression for normal b-cell markers CD20, 79a, 22, pax5, 
			- also poz for cd45, Bcl-6
			- neg : CD30, CD15, EBV

plasma cell neoplasms - final type of b cell malignancy 
- small number of **abnormal plasma cells** = monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance = MGUS ; prognosis good, risk of getting myeloma is 1% / yr, monitor it 
- higher numbers = with or without organ dysfunction = multiple/plasma cell myeloma 
	- prognosis - incurable + hard to treat bc it's mature cells. median survival 3-4 yrs... use chemo +/- stem cell transplant 
	- have evidence of monoclonal protein in sr or urine,bad plasma cells in bone marrow 
		- CRAB criteria = need to have multi organ impairment
		- hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions 
		- or 60%+ abnormal plasma clonal cells in bone marrow 
	- **smoldering** myeloma. - monoclonal protein, <60% clonal plasma cells in bone marrow/no CRAB criteria. 
	- MGUS - when we have way less, like <10% of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow 
- localized plasmacytoma formation - tumors happening outside of the bone marrow. 
- AL amyloid - abnormal amyloid is from the plasma cells which make that abnormal protein, which then are deposited = recall congo red stain apple green 
	- median survival 2 yrs 
- plasmas = eccentric nucleus normally, clock fae chromatin, perinuclear hoff/clear space. 
- abnormal morphology 
	- large size, prominent nucleolus, multinucleated
	- ducher bodies = intranuclear inclusions
	- russell bodies - IG containing cytomasmic vesicles
	- mott cell - having too many russell bodies in the cell 
- labs: peripheral blood smear - we see rouleaux formation - stack of coins of rbcs sticking togther bc of inc immunoglobuins 
	- electrophoresis shows monoclonal protein M-spike, immunofixation to characterize that abnormal monoclonal protein 
- plasmacytoma - solitary plasmacytoma of bone = up to 2/3 get myeloma 
- extraosseos plasmacytoma, some get myeloma 15%

mature t cell lymphomas - less common 
most common = mycosis fungoides - involve the skin 
t cell lymphomas - lose expression of normal antigens! while b cells gain antigen expressions
pan t cell antigens = CD3, cD2, CD5, CD7, CD4/CD8
- cd7 is most commonly lost; we don't have ez / reliable marker of monoclonality 
mycosis fungoides - abnormal t cells involve the epidermis 
- ppl get erythemitous cutaneous patches then evolving into plaques which inc infiltration with clusters called pautrier microabsesses then to the lymph nodes nodular stage
- abnormal lymphocytes = small to medium sized with cerebriform nuclei 
- little brain like cells , = pautrier microabsesses = **collections of malignant cells of epidermis**
- most likely CD3,CD2,CD4+, negative for CD7 
- prognosis - depends on extent or stage of the disease; usually indolent. in rash-like stage, often missed. 

sezary syndrome- mycosis fungoides which progresses to systemic involvement 
- diffuse triad of erythroderma - reddening of skin 
- generalized ymphadenopathy 
- sezary cells = **abnormal lymphocytes *cerebriform* nuclei WHEN it moves outside of skin1**
- - most likely CD3,CD2,CD4+, negative for CD7 
- poor prognosis - very poor, 5 yr survival 10-20% 

adult t cell leukemia/lymphoma = ATLL
- unique biology + can overlap
- viral association with HTLV-1 virus - south western JP, caribbean, central africa - spread thru blood/sex etc 
	- infection alone doesn't cause malignancy 
- signs - lymphadenopathy, rash, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions 
	- huge: high WBC, skin rash, etc. 
- irregularly shaped lobular nuclei - **flower cells!**
	- in the peripheral blood we see too many lymphocytes with flower cells
	- lymph nodes = architectural effacement 
	- skin = dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with epidermotorpism 
	- **pautrier like microabsesses too**
	- bone marrow - fewer neoplastic cells = but extensive osteoClastic activity = boney breakdown leads to hypercalcemia 
- poor prognosis 
- poz = CD4,CD3
- pertinent poz = CD25 expressed strongly , HTLV-1; negative CD7

langerhans cell histiocytosis - LCH = hans-schuller-christian disease
- accessory cells that mainly present antigen to lymphocytes - they have an elongated nuclei with grooves , might be multinucleated, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm,
	- usually have birbeck granules = granules shaped like tennis rackets in e-microscopy 
- this disease = abnormal prolif of these
- - happens in any age, mainly in kids/adolescents 
- solitary or multiple lesions, or involving single/multiple 
- might be disseminated and can happen with other neoplasms. 
	- **acute disseminated LCH - letterer-siwe disease**
	- triad = **hand-schuller-christian triad = calvarial bone lesions, diabetes insipidus, exophthalmos**
- lymph nodes - we see distended **sinuses** filled with langerhans cells + eosinophils 
- treat: surgery, steroids, chemo 
-
