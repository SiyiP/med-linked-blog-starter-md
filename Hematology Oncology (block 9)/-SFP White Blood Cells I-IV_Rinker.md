framework
![[WBC neoplasm framework]]
leukemia - from the bone marrow - progression marked by abnormal cells in blood + bone marrow- extended to peripheral blood - 
- classified acute - immautre blasts - block in stem cell maturation/differentiations = leading to neoplastic blasts. **blocked maturation**
- chronic = mature cells = block occurs later on in development 
- myeloid or lymphoid cells arise from these 
	- myeloid - think everything that's not like lymphocytes like t/b/nk cells. 
- normal bone marrow taken over by leukemic cells -> **cytopenias in peripheral blood, but WBC can be circulating increase!** - 
	- normal circularity % in bone marrow: 100-age, basically fat increases in your bone marrow with time. = **first order is in core bone marrow biopsy + aspirate**
	- are we cytopenic bc we have a malignancy in the bone marrow, or nothing there / aplastia 
lymphomas - arises in lymphoid tissue, like lymph nodes, spleen , thymus .... appear as tumors/masses
both leukemia and lymphomas are the similar in cell type j difference in where it comes from 

acute myeloid leukemia
- acute leukemia - 20%+ blasts in **peripheral blood OR bone marrow**
	- normal peripheral has no blasts
- signs + symptoms - cytopenias = bone marrow failure, thrombocytopenia (bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses), anemia, neutropenia 
- b-symptoms - fever night sweats, weight loss, bone pain, splenomeg, hepatomeg, etc. 
	- aleukemic leukemia - blasts trapped in marrow and don't make it to periphery 
myeloid blast. - **larger than lymphoid blasts, 3-4x size of rbc** more common - nucleolus + cytoplasmic granules 
- **auer rods - fused lysosomes ONLY THING DX of MYELOID LINEAGE!**
- AML - acute myeloid leukemia - has way more categories with different prognoses and stuff - these is clinically significant to subcategorize them into **genetic abnormalities or differentiation (what cell do the leukemias most look like), it's a very diverse dz category.**
	- APL - acute promyelocytic leukemia with PML::RARA fusion - **both have bilobed folded kidney/butterfly shaped nuclei!** - this translocation is present -> automatically APL 
		- hypergranular form - a lot of cyt and a ton of granules and auer rods
		- microgranular - fewer and sometimes no visible cyt granules and few rods 
		- ***this causes DIC!*** they all express tissue factor + annexin to breakdown fibrin 
		- this hybrid protein PML/RARA will block transcription/diff of granulocytes and stops it from getting mature. 
		- poz - CD117, CD33, CD13, neg for CD34, HLA-DR
		- TREAT: **with all-trans retinoic acid ATRA EARLY!!!! = good prognosis** to induce differentiation + reducing DIC risk. also arsenic 
	- monocytic lineage - 80% of leukemic cells in AML: acute monocytic leukemia 
		- monoblasts - round neucleus, visible/proominent nucleosis 
		- promonocytes - indented/folded nuc + less prominent nucleoli 
		- on the cells immunophenotype they have : CD4, CD14, CD64 
		- stain for nonspecific esterase = **monocytic lineage**
		- **they can relocate to the gums, gingival hypertrophy - huge extramedullary involvement**
	- AEL - acute erythroid leukemia - 30+% , are immature erythroid cells erythroblasts
		- round nuclei, agranular basophilic cytoplasm, cytomasmic vacuoles 
		- bone marrow has predominance of these
		- PAS+ stain, pink stain
		- has glycophorin + CD71 on the surface
	- acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
		- **associated with down syndrome/trisomy 21**
		- 20%+ blasts in bone marrow/blood, medium to large, **cytoplasmic blebs**
		- PAS+ stain
		- one or more of platelet glycoproteins CD41, CD61, CD42b 
favorable prognosis - acute promyelocytic leukemia w PML::RARA fusion 15;17, basically 50% have long term dz free survival! 15-30% overall survival
	t(8;21), t(16;16), and t(15;17)
bad prognosis - amls associated with myelodysplasia/late complications of cytotoxic therapies given for another disease = bad. 
- alkylating drugs, ionizing radiation etc. 

other prognostic factors in AML if no specific gene translocation 
- look for mutations in FLT3 and NPM1 gene
	- FLT3 = **mutation is a cytokine, worse prognosis**
	- NPM1 = **protein if mutated, good prognosis**
	- if poz for both, it's intermediate
TREAT: chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, ATRA for APL 

lymphoid blasts
- can be smaller, sometimes there's cytoplasmic granules 
common traits 
- nuc:cyt ratio smooth appearance in most blasts.
---
myelodysplastic syndrome - MDS. 
- **clonal hematopoietic stem cell dz - dysplasia in 1+ hematopoietic cell, at least 10% of total cells**
- *ineffective* hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias 
- inc risk to DEVELOP into acute myeloid leukemia 
MDS - typically in older adults but rare in younger
- risk - higher to progress into AML with inc % of blasts
- **Biallelic TP53 inactivation = very poor prognosis + very aggressive**
- more complex cytogenic abnormalities = worse prognosis 
- symptoms - CBC 1+ cytopenias and also symptoms associated. 
dysplasia in bone marrow how to define? 
- 10% of it in a particular lineage show dysplastic features
- in erythroid + granulocytic cells = look at the bone marrow aspirate slides
- in megakaryotic cells - look at core biopsy slides 
- 50-70% of MDS has at least 1 cytogenetic abnormality, **most common loss of 5 or 7 chromosome.** 
- gene mutations: **dna mehtylation, histones, rna splicing and transcription**
	- peripheral blood smear - shows up in the neutrophils usually - shows up abnormally hypogranular, hyposegmentation
	- platelets - thrombocytopenia, large platelets
	- macrocytic anemia with MDS! + anisopoikilocytosis with RBCs 
-  RBC precursors we can see dysplasia in bone marrow
	- nuclear budding (flower nuclei)
	- karyorrhexis - nuclei blowing up completingly 
	- megaloblastic change - cell too large for what stage it's in like if it's a darker red, it's too large 
	- ring sideroblasts seen in iron stain 
- dysplasia: granulocytes
	- hypogranularity, hypo/hypersegmentation, alterations in size, abnormally large granules
	- auer rods - seen in blasts and rarely in more mature granulocytes 
- dysplastic megakaryocytes
	- micromegakaryocytes = too small
	- nuclear hypolobation = **they normally have a very big complex fuzzy nucleus but in these abnormal ones they just have 2 uniform widely separated nuclear lobes.**
MDS - classification - not critical to memorize all the terminology for subcategorization 
- key - inc number of blasts = more aggressive and worse prognosis . auer rods. = will always make the disease more serious and bump down the prognosis to worse
- we newly have separate categories for pts with separate genetic abnormalities 



![[Neoplastic White Blood Cells II-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Immature Lymphoid Neoplasms_Rinker_PPT (1).pdf]]
myelo*proliferative* neoplasms 
- effective maturation, but **abnormally low apoptosis**, but high proliferation. 
- underlying etiology - still a clonal stem cell disorder , but are characterized by **EFFECTIVE maturation** in the bone marrow instead of ineffective like in MDS
	- bone marrow - hypercellular, increased amount of myeloid lineages 
- peripheral blood has cytosis - more type of cells - **unlike MDS, where you end up with cytopenias** peripherally
- associated with translocations/point mutations 
	- activated tyrosine kinase receptors+**tyrosine pathways in general**
	- enhanced expression of proteins participating in anti-apoptotic pathways 
common features - they all **have the potential to permeate at the same end point. - termination of bone marrow failure**: happens via fibrosis, ineffective hematopoiesis, transformation to acute leukemia. 
- CML - chronic myeloid leukemia - most common, predom in adults, but can be in kids
	- 20-40% asymptomatic but fatigue, weight loss, bone pain, splenomegaly, night sweats
	- labs - CBC - usually leukocytosis , 
	- BEST TEST DX: **t(9;22) BCR-ABL1** - enhanced tyrosine kinase activity of BCR/ABL1 causing constitutive activity -> proliferation 
		- PCR monitoring most sensitive 
		- note - this protein is a fusion protein but many different types can be made with sqme translocation - this is on the larger side bigger than the one in ALL. 
	- low LAP score - not in our tests
	- dz course - chronic -> accerlerated -> blast phase 
		- chronic phase - in periphery, we see leukocytosis, <10% blasts, no dysplasia, basphilia, and granulocytosis at all stages of maturation - left shift, basophilia (throwback, no benign causes of basophilia), thrombocytosis too -
			- hypercellular bone marrow , granulocytes in all stages of maturation, more myeloid than rbc 
			- **dwarf megakaryocytes seen**
			- blasts <10%
			- TREAT: tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs - imatinib 
		- accerlerated phase - <20% blasts, but more. evidence of disease progression **in spite of treatment** = with inc wbc, thrombocytopenia or cytosis, bone marrow **fibrosis**, additional genetic abnormalities
			- TREAT: switch to diff TKI 
		- blast phase >20% blasts in periphery or marrow - basically acute myeloid leukemia, but we still consider it part of the CML spectrum ; **25% of these blasts proliferating are acute lymphoblasts instead; acute lymphoblastic leukemias B>>T** -> thought that the genetic abnormalities build up on an even earlier phase  
			- treat as acute leukemia if all other TKI fail + bone marrow transplant 
- polycythemia vera - primary issue = inc rbc prod independent of normal mechanisms
	- hyperviscosity like headaches, dizziness, flushing, redness, htn, thrombosis 
	- PLATELET dysfunction + pruitis **after bathing** bc temp increase leads to mast cell degranulation. inc in other types of cells 
	- **JAK2 mutation poz in 95% of cases = activating tyrosine kinase!**
		- this pathway is always active even when not binded with erythropoietin 
	- bone marrow = **hypercellularity of all 3 cell lines**, no dysplasia (effective normal maturation unlike MDS), iron stores decreased 
	- progression - spent phase = marrow is fibrotic, -> acute myeloid leukemia up to 20% ppl 
	- TREAT: phlembotomy + antithrombotics like aspirin, JAK2 inhibitors too 
	- prognosis - good survival 10+ yrs .... death from thrombosis/hemorrhage
- secondary polycythemia - underlying process, not neoplastic but **physiologically appropriate**
	- chronic pulm/cv dz
	- high o2 affinity hemoblogbinopathy 
	- inc carboxyhb with smoking and methb , or resistance at high altitude
	- **physiologically inappropriate** - adrenal cortical hypersecretion, hydronephrosis with inc erythropoietin, or tumor making erythropoietin
	- relative polycythemia - meaning decreased plasma volume, like if you lose lots of fluids, recall ur hematocrit's a ratio, so it'll look bigger
essential thrombocythemia -
- abnormally high platelet production - some abnormally large. 
- clinical findings = giant platelets close in size with red cell
- 50+% are asymptomatic, but we might see thrombosis + hemorrhage
- JAK2 mutations + CALR, MPL mutations all jakstat pathway 
- bone marrow = see staghorn nuclei hypersegmented megakarycytes which are also a bigger number now 
- TREAT: antithrombotics + jak2 inhib
- progression - spent phase after years, marrow gets fibrotic. and progression happens to acute myeloid leukemia , **but this is lowest risk, <5%**
- prognosis - good typically peaceful with some interruptions of thrombotic episodes

primary myelofibrosis - prolif of granulocytes and megakaryocytes with depo of fibrosis 
- like 30% + asymptmatic but you get abdominal pain, thrombosis, hemorrhage, splenomegaly 
- peripheral blood - some left shift, 
	- early: inc platelets + wbc
	- late: cytopenias, tear drop RBCs, leukoerythroblastic with left granulocytes + nucleated rbcs 
- JAK2, CALR, MPL
- bone marrow: 
	- pre-fibrotic / cellular phase: hypercellular marrow, inc granulocytes + inc/abnormal **clustered circular lobed megakaryocytes**
	- fibrotic phase - inc fibrosis + **atypical megakaryocytes too**
	- prognosis - worse, 3-7 yrs fibrosis, death from bone marrow failure like hemorrhage/infection, 30% get AML
	TREAT: antithrombotics, JAK2 inhib, transplant

immature lymphoid neoplasms 
maturation block after hematopoietic stem cell has chosen to become lymphoid 
- all start in bone marrow then travel to blood then the periphery with b to the lymph nodes, t to the thymus 
precursor b cell neoplasms - broken down due to the lineage/genetic abnormalities 
B-ALL - **b lymphoblastic leukemia**
- most common malignancy of kids
- 20+% blasts in peripheral blod + bone marrow
- abrupt onset: fatigue, fever, bleeding, prolonged infection, bone pain, CNS involvement (**blasts will go into the nervous system)** lymphadenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly
- peripheral blood : has leukocytosis with lymphoblasts - huge - 
- bone marrow - hypercellular, sheets of lymphoblasts replacing ; don't tend to happen in lymph nodes
- morphology - **t and b the same blasts** - intermeiate in size, **very high nuc:cyt ratio!!1 scant agranular cytoplasm, no auer rods**
	- not always possible to tell them apart based on morphology - look at genetics 
- prognosis - overall good, but things associated with worse:
	- very young <2 yrs, older age 10+ yrs
	- high wbc at dx, and **philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)** - same thing in CML
	- better prognosis with hyperdiploidy 
THE BEST WAY TO TELL APART IN ACUTE LEUKEMIAS
- **flow cytometry - you can test for markers**
	- Immaturity markers: CD34, TdT, HLA-DR - 35 and TdT = **not as specific but tells you that it's a blast**
	- b cell line - **CD19**, CD22, **CD79a**
	- usually poz for CD10 
- lymphoblast - **PAS stain**
- myeloblasts: MPO, SBB, chloroacetate esterase CAE, NSE nonspecific esterase 

T-ALL t lymphoblastic leukemias
- 15% of childhood ALLs = more common in adolescents 
- 20+% blasts in peripheral and/or bone marrow - can happen in both lymph nodes (**lymphomas**) and bone marrow
	- makes mediastinal mass with thymus involvement - 
- leukocytosis w/ lymphoblasts, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia all in periphery 
- flow cyt
	- markers; CD34, TdT imaturity 
	- T lineage - CD3, CD2, CD5, CD7 = **in the thymus they get CD4 and CD8... this is why we might have these! or both or neither!!!!**
- cytochem stains = lymphoblasts - PAS 
- cytogenetics - no major associations 

![[Neoplastic White Blood Cells III-Mature Small B-Cell Neoplasms_Rinker_PPT (1).pdf]]
lymphomas - they are all clonal - from a genetically aberrant common cell that duplicates
- lymphadenopathy/or mass formation - mediastinum, gi tract, and skin. 
- some spill out into the bone marrow and are detected in peripheral blood = "leukemic phase"
- b cell lymphomas are more!!! 
- cell surface markers. = **critical for diagnosis! and flow cyt + immunohistochem**
- anything that disrupts immune system predisposes to lymphomas - like immunosuppressive drugs + HIV/AIDs

normal b cell dev
- they all progenitors happen from lymphoblasts of bone marrow = VDJ recomb
- leave bone marrow - mature but naive b-cells ; just igM 
- enter germinal center of lymph nodes - get clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation, class switching from igM to IgG/A, differentiation into memory and plasma cells
	- should undergo apoptosis here if any hang ups happen
- leave follicles and going to marginal zone or whatever other part of body
normally - mature b lymphocytes - have **kappa or lamda proteins, normal kappa:lambda ratio: 2-3:1**
- normally we have a mix of kappa poz and lambda poz cells - seen in flow cytometry 
- **b cell neoplasms are IDENTICAL - light chain restriction, monotypic, all kappa or all lambda**
	- they also show aberrant antigen expression - like antigens that normal b cells don't: in mantle cell lymphoma, CD5(typically on t cells), cyclin D1 

mature b-cell neoplasms - a ton of these
low grade ones: 

chronic lymphocytic leukemia - CLL - leukocytosis w/ lymphocytosis **in peripheral blood** ; inc. mature monotypic b cells with CLL immunophenotype  ; cracked earth snickerdoodle 

small lymphocytic lymphoma - SLL - lymphadenopathy/extranodal tumor formation, more confined to lymph node - mature monotypic b cells still, with CLL 
- these both - usually male, middle to elderly 
- asymptomatic might be, b-symptoms, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hypogammaglobulinemia ... see lymphocytosis , anemia, thrombocytopenia
- see: **small lymphocytes, scant, agranular cyt, round nuclei, exagerrated heterogenous appearance: SOCCER BALLs, cracked earth appearance.**
	- also smudge cells. - fragililty here, squashed lymphocytes 
	- soccer ball/cracked earth 
- in lymph nodes - when there's SLL
	- diffuse effacement of norm lymph node architecture - basically we don't see germinal centers etc folliles, just homogenous mix... sheets of small lymphocytes w same appearance as CLL 
	- "pale areas" = proliferation centers, bsically these lymphocytes with more cytoplasm, **bc mitotic activity is taking place**
- involvement of bone marrow
	- aspirate smear - small lymphocytes similar to periphery 
	- core biopsy - **nodular ymphoid aggregates or diffuse sheets of lymphocytes**
- immunophenotype - poz for mature b cell normal markers - CD19, 20, 22, Pax-5, CD79 
- monotypic surface immunoglobulin (weak) - like kappa and lambda
- usually pertinent poz - CD5/CD23 for the CLL/SLL
- pert. negative - CD10, cyclin-D1, FMC7 
- genetic standpoint - no dx translation, but there's common mutations
	- prognosis good with deletion 13q 
	- prognosis bad with deletion 11, 17p
- can be managed, but canonot be cured. unless people are monitored for disease 
- prognosis very bad when it transforms into large cell diffuse lymphoma 

mantle cell lymphoma - more aggro than CLL
- mature b cell lymphoma = translocation - (11;14) - basically IGH gene on chromosome 14 , and bcl1/cyclin d1 on 11,, leading to **upregulation of cyclin d1**
- median age 60 yrs, male>female
- asymptomatic, lymph, etc, **GI mucosal involvement, we see polyps.... lymphomatoid polyposis - little nodules of lymphoma LOOKs like polyps**
	- regular small lymphocytes 
	- nodular, expanded (with preservation of germinal centers)
	- diffuse,
	- pwith some bone marrow involvement in aggresvie dz  
- same b cell markers - cd19, cd20, cd22, cd79a, pax-5
	- **monotypic surface strong immunoglobulin; basically expresses above ones stronger**
	- aberrant poz - cd5, cyclin-d1, fmc7 
	- pertinent neg - cd10 
	- lambda restricted profile 
- genetics - (11;14) ;; and detect with fluorescence i nsitu, fish 
- more aggro than cll/sll, but doesn't transform into dlbcl 

**follicular lymphoma** - comprised of germinal center derived b cells
- **(14;18) - the immunoglobulin heavy gene is changed,** 
- **BCL-2** overexpression (apoptotic protein) gene on 18 and IGH gene on 14... 
- median age 60 yrs both gender
- asymptomatic, b symptoms, lymphadenopathy - 
- we see paleness
- nodular pattern, folliular - **back to back foollicles with expanded germinal centers**
	- in middle - we see lack of macrophages - they are filled with centroocytes (small) and centroblasts
	- grade lymphomas = more centroblasts = worse
- only 30% bone marrow invovelemnt - hugs surface of bone
- markers -  cd19, cd20, cd22, cd79a, pax-5
	- expressed poz: CD10, BCL6, BCL2 (aberrant , recall this is anti-apoptotic protein, can't express)
	- we can also do a stain for bcl-2 - shows up as yellow signals in these FISH
- prognosis: lower grade = longer survival, but not curable bc mature b cells (not as chemosensitive, harder to eradicate)
	- similar to CLL, might progress to diffuse large b cell lymphomas 

marginal zone lymphoma - arise from the outiside of follicles, in many areas of body 
- MALT lymphomas - extranodal marginal zone lyphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue - unique; but can appear in spleen etc. 
	- extranodal, of small heterogenous b cells
	- develop de novo or with **chronic inflammatory conditions - H pylori + hashimotos, sjogrens syndrome**
	- treating H. pylori -> resolving this potentially! 
	- female 61 yrs old mainly 
	- infiltration of small heterogenous lymphocytes - with invasion of overlying epithelial surface
		- going into gastric glands - lymphoepithelial lesions 
		- bone marrow involvement uncommon. 
		- non-specific b cell immunophenotype - don't aberrantly express cd5, cd10 = these are pertinent negatives
	- not genetically specific either, depends on site. 
	- prognosis = good , even less aggro than chemo. treat with h. pylori 

higher grade mature b lyphomas
burkitt lymphomas - 
- endemically - large jaw mass, malarial distribution in africa, brazil , new guinea, kids, 
- sporadic form - kids/young adults immunodef like HIV, we see ileocecal valve + gonads 
- lymph node architecture - loss of this, monotonous sheets of tumor cells + high prolif
	- **starry sky appearance bc inc tangible body macrophages** that are trying to clean up the other cells! 
	- avg lymphocytes - basophilic cytoplasm, cytoplasmic vacuoles, inconspicuous nucleoli
	- bone marrow involvement is frequent in immunodeficiency cases 
- germinal center differentiation - similar to follicular lymphoma - **poz for CD10**.... 
	- also poz for **Ki-67** - meaning very high proliferation index
	- **pertinent negative for Bcl-2** , which sets it apart from **follicular lymphoma which is poz for bcl-2 = this is (14;18) mutation** 
- genetics (8;14) - MYC oncogene chromosome 8, and IgH gene chromosome 14 
	- very responsive to chemo, 80-90% survival! good at curing this! 

lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma - 
- proliferation of **clonal b lymph with plasmacytic differentiation**
	- more plasmacytoid ones + clonal plasma cells
- protein electrophoresis is crucial - ppl have monolonal gammopathy in serum 
	- igM is very big, and can stick together - **hyperviscocity of blood**
	- visual, neuro impairment, renal dysfunction 
- peripheral smear/aspirate - bone marrow - involved usually!!! more leukemic presentation
	- small lymphocytes w/ minimal cyt
	- plasmacytoid lymphocytes = eccentric nuc, more cytoplasm
	- plasma cells = eccentric nuc + basophilic cytoplasm 
	- bone marrow core biopsy - usually same cells in nodular, loose or interstitial pattern with inc mast cells
- when there's rarely lymph node involvement- in paracortical, sinusoid, or diffuse, variable pattern. 
- splenic - white pulp expansion mostly 
- similar phenotype to marginal zone lymphomas - CD19, cd20, cd22, cd79a, pax5 all normal
	- negative for cd5, cd10 so nonspecific
	- plasma cells = CD138, CD38 , mum-1 
	- light chain restriction 
- **genetics = myd88 mutation!!! - essential to differentiate from marginal zone lymphoma** 
- prognosis - indolent, median survival is 5-10 yrs 

hairy cell leukemia - uncommon, older men, unique!!! 
- massive splenomegaly abdominal discomfort
- **cytopenia/pancytopenia uniquely!** - fatigue + recurrent infections! 
- peripheral blood - larger than lymphocytes
	- oval to bean shaped nuclei 
	- disperse chromatin ; more cytoplasm than others have - fried egg appearance. 
	- pale blue cytoplasm with hairs!!!
- spleens - have **red** pulp expansion , white pulp regression + blood lakes
- livers - have small lymphocyte clusters in sinuses + portals + blood lakes 
	- immunophenotype - all have cd19,20, 22, 79a, pax-5
	- **pertinent poz - traid of CD11c, CD25, CD103**
	- also poz for cyclin d1, annexin a1
	- pertinent negs cd5, cd10 
	- cytochemistry - **TRAP marker - here - red staining in cyt of hairy cells**
	- BRAF mutation. - activates this with downstream mapk, proliferation etc. **therapy with BRAF inhibitors**
- cellularity is variable in these. some people can have ***aplastic* marrow + we only see it when staining cyclin d1 or cd20**
	- also reticulin fibrosis possible 
- prognosis - responds good to BRAF inhibitors + chemotherapies

"rest of the lymphomas"
diffuse large b-cell lymphomas 
- some of the smaller ones can transform into this 
- most common non-hodgekin lymphoma
- most commonly in adults, nucleus same size or larger than a macrophage nucleus; 3x the size of normal lymphocytes
	- open/clear chromatin, visible nucleoli 
- might be de novo 
- clinically very aggro, rapidly fatal if untreated
	- chemo + rituximab anti CD20 in about 50% of cases treatable 
- mature b cell - CD19,20,22,79a, pax5
- more heterogenous than the small cell b lymphomas
	- some have germinal center differentiation cd10, bcl-6
	- or activated b-cell/non-germinal center difff = mum-1 
	- variable genetic proifle too - bcl6,2, myc too commonly trasnlocated 

hodgkin lymphoma - b cell origin
- classic hodgkin lymphoma - b cell lymphoma full of hodgkin like or HL cells and some reed-sternberg cells - scattered within a bgd of **inflammatory infiltrate - reactive/non-neoplastic**
		- HL = large, single nuc, prominent eosinophilic nucleolis 
		- reed-sternberg RS cells = subtype of hodgkin cell; inclusion like bi/multinuc, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli 
		- lacunar cells = HL/RS cell sitting in an empty space (retraction artifact)
		- mummified cell = degenerated HL/RS cell with nucleus appearing **smudgey**
	- nodular sclerosis - we have dense fibrotic bands dividing the lymph node into diffuse areas. ; **typically presents with slow growing, painless lymphadenopathy with a mediastinal mass**
	- mixed cellularity - relatively few large hodgkin cells with a bgd of rich eosinophils and cells with a lot of pink cytoplasm 
	- note- cervical lymphadenopathy slow grower mainly 
	- lymphocyte rich 
	- lymphocyte depleted 
	- they pertinent poz = cd30, cd15, pax-5 , +/- EBV. 
		- pertinent negatives = CD45, CD20, CD79a
	- prognosis: favorable, related to age + stage
	- TREAT: chemo + rad 
- nodular lymphocyte-predominant hodgkin/b-cell lymphoma - not biologically relatted to hodgkin lymphoma, just visually 
	- neoplastic cells = large b cells with multilobated nuclei = has **popcorn cells** + lymphocyte predominant cells .... **constituting a minority of cellular material**  similar to classic hodgkins 
	- notably mediastinal involvement less common than classic hodgkins
		- still slow growing isolated lymphadenopathy 
		- rarely : b symptoms and bone marrow invovlement + cervical mostly 
		- vaguely nodular growth pattern - we can draw some lines around some non-normal looking follicules 
	- bgd = small lymphocytes. + histiocytes
	- less common than classic, more males, 
	- prognosis: VERY good esp just one lymph node involved, but recurrence is common 
		- poor factors = diffuse growth pattern, spleen involvement, high stage
	- immunophenotype - LH 
		- RETAIN expression for normal b-cell markers CD20, 79a, 22, pax5, 
			- also poz for cd45, Bcl-6
			- neg : CD30, CD15, EBV

plasma cell neoplasms - final type of b cell malignancy 
- small number of abnormal plasma cells = monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance = MGUS ; prognosis good, risk of getting myeloma is 1% / yr, monitor it 
- higher numbers = with or without organ dysfunction = multiple/plasma cell myeloma 
	- prognosis - incurable + hard to treat bc it's mature cells. median survival 3-4 yrs... use chemo +/- stem cell transplant 
	- have evidence of monoclonal protein in sr or urine,bad plasma cells in bone marrow 
		- CRAB criteria = need to have multi organ impairment
		- hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions 
		- or 60%+ abnormal plasma clonal cells in bone marrow 
	- **smoldering** myeloma. - monoclonal protein, <60% clonal plasma cells in bone marrow/no CRAB criteria. 
	- MGUS - when we have way less, like <10% of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow 
- localized plasmacytoma formation - tumors happening outside of the bone marrow. 
- AL amyloid - abnormal amyloid is from the plasma cells which make that abnormal protein, which then are deposited = recall congo red stain apple green 
	- median survival 2 yrs 
- plasmas = eccentric nucleus normally, clock fae chromatin, perinuclear hoff/clear space. 
- abnormal morphology 
	- large size, prominent nucleolus, multinucleated
	- ducher bodies = intranuclear inclusions
	- russell bodies - IG containing cytomasmic vesicles
	- mott cell - having too many russell bodies in the cell 
- labs: peripheral blood smear - we see rouleaux formation - stack of coins of rbcs sticking togther bc of inc immunoglobuins 
	- electrophoresis shows monoclonal protein M-spike, immunofixation to characterize that abnormal monoclonal protein 
- plasmacytoma - solitary plasmacytoma of bone = up to 2/3 get myeloma 
- extraosseos plasmacytoma, some get myeloma 15% 

---
mature t cell lymphomas - less common 
most common = mycosis fungoides - involve the skin 
t cell lymphomas - lose expression of normal antigens! while b cells gain antigen expressions
pan t cell antigens = CD3, cD2, CD5, CD7, CD4/CD8
- cd7 is most commonly lost; we don't have ez / reliable marker of monoclonality 
mycosis fungoides - abnormal t cells involve the epidermis 
- ppl get erythemitous cutaneous patches then evolving into plaques which inc infiltration with clusters called pautrier microabsesses then to the lymph nodes nodular stage
- abnormal lymphocytes = small to medium sized with cerebriform nuclei 
- little brain like cells , = pautrier microabsesses = **collections of malignant cells of epidermis**
- most likely CD3,CD2,CD4+, negative for CD7 
- prognosis - depends on extent or stage of the disease; usually indolent. in rash-like stage, often missed. 

sezary syndrome- mycosis fungoides which progresses to systemic involvement 
- diffuse triad of erythroderma - reddening of skin 
- generalized ymphadenopathy 
- sezary cells = **abnormal lymphocytes cerebriform nuclei WHEN it moves outside of skin1**
- - most likely CD3,CD2,CD4+, negative for CD7 
- poor prognosis - very poor, 5 yr survival 10-20% 

adult t cell leukemia/lymphoma = ATLL
- unique biology + can overlap
- viral association with HTLV-1 virus - south western JP, caribbean, central africa - spread thru blood/sex etc 
	- infection alone doesn't cause malignancy 
- signs - lymphadenopathy, rash, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions 
	- huge: high WBC, skin rash, etc. 
- irregularly shaped lobular nuclei - **flower cells!**
	- in the peripheral blood we see too many lymphocytes with flower cells
	- lymph nodes = architectural effacement 
	- skin = dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with epidermotorpism 
	- **pautrier like microabsesses too**
	- bone marrow - fewer neoplastic cells = but extensive osteoClastic activity = boney breakdown leads to hypercalcemia 
- poor prognosis 
- poz = CD4,CD3
- pertinent poz = CD25 expressed strongly , HTLV-1; negative CD7

langerhans cell histiocytosis - LCH 
- accessory cells that mainly present antigen to lymphocytes - they have an elongated nuclei with grooves , might be multinucleated, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm,
	- usually have birbeck granules = granules shaped like tennis rackets in e-microscopy 
- this disease = abnormal prolif of these
- - happens in any age, mainly in kids/adolescents 
- solitary or multiple lesions, or involving single/multiple 
- might be disseminated and can happen with other neoplasms. 
	- **acute disseminated LCH - letterer-siwe disease**
	- triad = **hand-schuller-christian triad = calvarial bone lesions, diabetes insipidus, exophthalmos**
- lymph nodes - we see distended **sinuses** filled with langerhans cells + eosinophils 
- treat: surgery, steroids, chemo
