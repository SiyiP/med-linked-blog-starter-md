framework
![[WBC neoplasm framework]]
leukemia - from the bone marrow - progression marked by abnormal cells in blood + bone marrow- extended to peripheral blood - 
- classified acute - immautre blasts - block in stem cell maturation/differentiations = leading to neoplastic blasts. **blocked maturation**
- chronic = mature cells = block occurs later on in development 
- myeloid or lymphoid cells arise from these 
	- myeloid - think everything that's not like lymphocytes like t/b/nk cells. 
- normal bone marrow taken over by leukemic cells -> **cytopenias in peripheral blood, but WBC can be circulating increase!** - 
	- normal circularity % in bone marrow: 100-age, basically fat increases in your bone marrow with time. = **first order is in core bone marrow biopsy + aspirate**
	- are we cytopenic bc we have a malignancy in the bone marrow, or nothing there / aplastia 
lymphomas - arises in lymphoid tissue, like lymph nodes, spleen , thymus .... appear as tumors/masses
both leukemia and lymphomas are the similar in cell type j difference in where it comes from 

acute myeloid leukemia
- acute leukemia - 20%+ blasts in **peripheral blood OR bone marrow**
	- normal peripheral has no blasts
- signs + symptoms - cytopenias = bone marrow failure, thrombocytopenia (bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses), anemia, neutropenia 
- b-symptoms - fever night sweats, weight loss, bone pain, splenomeg, hepatomeg, etc. 
	- aleukemic leukemia - blasts trapped in marrow and don't make it to periphery 
myeloid blast. - **larger than lymphoid blasts, 3-4x size of rbc** more common - nucleolus + cytoplasmic granules 
- **auer rods - fused lysosomes ONLY THING DX of MYELOID LINEAGE!**
- AML - acute myeloid leukemia - has way more categories with different prognoses and stuff - these is clinically significant to subcategorize them into **genetic abnormalities or differentiation (what cell do the leukemias most look like), it's a very diverse dz category.**
	- APL - acute promyelocytic leukemia with PML::RARA fusion - **both have bilobed folded kidney/butterfly shaped nuclei!** - this translocation is present -> automatically APL 
		- hypergranular form - a lot of cyt and a ton of granules and auer rods
		- microgranular - fewer and sometimes no visible cyt granules and few rods 
		- ***this causes DIC!*** they all express tissue factor + annexin to breakdown fibrin 
		- this hybrid protein PML/RARA will block transcription/diff of granulocytes and stops it from getting mature. 
		- poz - CD117, CD33, CD13, neg for CD34, HLA-DR
		- TREAT: **with all-trans retinoic acid ATRA EARLY!!!! = good prognosis** to induce differentiation + reducing DIC risk. also arsenic 
	- monocytic lineage - 80% of leukemic cells in AML: acute monocytic leukemia 
		- monoblasts - round neucleus, visible/proominent nucleosis 
		- promonocytes - indented/folded nuc + less prominent nucleoli 
		- on the cells immunophenotype they have : CD4, CD14, CD64 
		- stain for nonspecific esterase = **monocytic lineage**
		- **they can relocate to the gums, gingival hypertrophy - huge extramedullary involvement**
	- AEL - acute erythroid leukemia - 30+% , are immature erythroid cells erythroblasts
		- round nuclei, agranular basophilic cytoplasm, cytomasmic vacuoles 
		- bone marrow has predominance of these
		- PAS+ stain, pink stain
		- has glycophorin + CD71 on the surface
	- acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
		- **associated with down syndrome/trisomy 21**
		- 20%+ blasts in bone marrow/blood, medium to large, **cytoplasmic blebs**
		- PAS+ stain
		- one or more of platelet glycoproteins CD41, CD61, CD42b 
favorable prognosis - acute promyelocytic leukemia w PML::RARA fusion 15;17, basically 50% have long term dz free survival! 15-30% overall survival
	t(8;21), t(16;16), and t(15;17)
bad prognosis - amls associated with myelodysplasia/late complications of cytotoxic therapies given for another disease = bad. 
- alkylating drugs, ionizing radiation etc. 

other prognostic factors in AML if no specific gene translocation 
- look for mutations in FLT3 and NPM1 gene
	- FLT3 = **mutation is a cytokine, worse prognosis**
	- NPM1 = **protein if mutated, good prognosis**
	- if poz for both, it's intermediate
TREAT: chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, ATRA for APL 

lymphoid blasts
- can be smaller, sometimes there's cytoplasmic granules 
common traits 
- nuc:cyt ratio smooth appearance in most blasts.
---
myelodysplastic syndrome - MDS. 
- **clonal hematopoietic stem cell dz - dysplasia in 1+ hematopoietic cell, at least 10% of total cells**
- *ineffective* hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias 
- inc risk to DEVELOP into acute myeloid leukemia 
MDS - typically in older adults but rare in younger
- risk - higher to progress into AML with inc % of blasts
- **Biallelic TP53 inactivation = very poor prognosis + very aggressive**
- more complex cytogenic abnormalities = worse prognosis 
- symptoms - CBC 1+ cytopenias and also symptoms associated. 
dysplasia in bone marrow how to define? 
- 10% of it in a particular lineage show dysplastic features
- in erythroid + granulocytic cells = look at the bone marrow aspirate slides
- in megakaryotic cells - look at core biopsy slides 
- 50-70% of MDS has at least 1 cytogenetic abnormality, **most common loss of 5 or 7 chromosome.** 
- gene mutations: **dna mehtylation, histones, rna splicing and transcription**
	- peripheral blood smear - shows up in the neutrophils usually - shows up abnormally hypogranular, hyposegmentation
	- platelets - thrombocytopenia, large platelets
	- macrocytic anemia with MDS! + anisopoikilocytosis with RBCs 
-  RBC precursors we can see dysplasia in bone marrow
	- nuclear budding (flower nuclei)
	- karyorrhexis - nuclei blowing up completingly 
	- megaloblastic change - cell too large for what stage it's in like if it's a darker red, it's too large 
	- ring sideroblasts seen in iron stain 
- dysplasia: granulocytes
	- hypogranularity, hypo/hypersegmentation, alterations in size, abnormally large granules
	- auer rods - seen in blasts and rarely in more mature granulocytes 
- dysplastic megakaryocytes
	- micromegakaryocytes = too small
	- nuclear hypolobation = **they normally have a very big complex fuzzy nucleus but in these abnormal ones they just have 2 uniform widely separated nuclear lobes.**
MDS - classification - not critical to memorize all the terminology for subcategorization 
- key - inc number of blasts = more aggressive and worse prognosis . auer rods. = will always make the disease more serious and bump down the prognosis to worse
- we newly have separate categories for pts with separate genetic abnormalities 



![[Neoplastic White Blood Cells II-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Immature Lymphoid Neoplasms_Rinker_PPT (1).pdf]]
myelo*proliferative* neoplasms 
- effective maturation, but **abnormally low apoptosis**, but high proliferation. 
- underlying etiology - still a clonal stem cell disorder , but are characterized by **EFFECTIVE maturation** in the bone marrow instead of ineffective like in MDS
	- bone marrow - hypercellular, increased amount of myeloid lineages 
- peripheral blood has cytosis - more type of cells - **unlike MDS, where you end up with cytopenias** peripherally
- associated with translocations/point mutations 
	- activated tyrosine kinase receptors+**tyrosine pathways in general**
	- enhanced expression of proteins participating in anti-apoptotic pathways 
common features - they all **have the potential to permeate at the same end point. - termination of bone marrow failure**: happens via fibrosis, ineffective hematopoiesis, transformation to acute leukemia. 
- CML - chronic myeloid leukemia - most common, predom in adults, but can be in kids
	- 20-40% asymptomatic but fatigue, weight loss, bone pain, splenomegaly, night sweats
	- labs - CBC - usually leukocytosis , 
	- BEST TEST DX: **t(9;22) BCR-ABL1** - enhanced tyrosine kinase activity of BCR/ABL1 causing constitutive activity -> proliferation 
		- PCR monitoring most sensitive 
		- note - this protein is a fusion protein but many different types can be made with sqme translocation - this is on the larger side bigger than the one in ALL. 
	- low LAP score - not in our tests
	- dz course - chronic -> accerlerated -> blast phase 
		- chronic phase - in periphery, we see leukocytosis, <10% blasts, no dysplasia, basphilia, and granulocytosis at all stages of maturation - left shift, basophilia (throwback, no benign causes of basophilia), thrombocytosis too -
			- hypercellular bone marrow , granulocytes in all stages of maturation, more myeloid than rbc 
			- **dwarf megakaryocytes seen**
			- blasts <10%
			- TREAT: tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs - imatinib 
		- accerlerated phase - <20% blasts, but more. evidence of disease progression **in spite of treatment** = with inc wbc, thrombocytopenia or cytosis, bone marrow **fibrosis**, additional genetic abnormalities
			- TREAT: switch to diff TKI 
		- blast phase >20% blasts in periphery or marrow - basically acute myeloid leukemia, but we still consider it part of the CML spectrum ; **25% of these blasts proliferating are acute lymphoblasts instead; acute lymphoblastic leukemias B>>T** -> thought that the genetic abnormalities build up on an even earlier phase  
			- treat as acute leukemia if all other TKI fail + bone marrow transplant 
- polycythemia vera - primary issue = inc rbc prod independent of normal mechanisms
	- hyperviscosity like headaches, dizziness, flushing, redness, htn, thrombosis 
	- PLATELET dysfunction + pruitis **after bathing** bc temp increase leads to mast cell degranulation. inc in other types of cells 
	- **JAK2 mutation poz in 95% of cases = activating tyrosine kinase!**
		- this pathway is always active even when not binded with erythropoietin 
	- bone marrow = **hypercellularity of all 3 cell lines**, no dysplasia (effective normal maturation unlike MDS), iron stores decreased 
	- progression - spent phase = marrow is fibrotic, -> acute myeloid leukemia up to 20% ppl 
	- TREAT: phlembotomy + antithrombotics like aspirin, JAK2 inhibitors too 
	- prognosis - good survival 10+ yrs .... death from thrombosis/hemorrhage
- secondary polycythemia - underlying process, not neoplastic but **physiologically appropriate**
	- chronic pulm/cv dz
	- high o2 affinity hemoblogbinopathy 
	- inc carboxyhb with smoking and methb , or resistance at high altitude
	- **physiologically inappropriate** - adrenal cortical hypersecretion, hydronephrosis with inc erythropoietin, or tumor making erythropoietin
	- relative polycythemia - meaning decreased plasma volume, like if you lose lots of fluids, recall ur hematocrit's a ratio, so it'll look bigger
essential thrombocythemia -
- abnormally high platelet production - some abnormally large. 
- clinical findings = giant platelets close in size with red cell
- 50+% are asymptomatic, but we might see thrombosis + hemorrhage
- JAK2 mutations + CALR, MPL mutations all jakstat pathway 
- bone marrow = see staghorn nuclei hypersegmented megakarycytes which are also a bigger number now 
- TREAT: antithrombotics + jak2 inhib
- progression - spent phase after years, marrow gets fibrotic. and progression happens to acute myeloid leukemia , **but this is lowest risk, <5%**
- prognosis - good typically peaceful with some interruptions of thrombotic episodes

primary myelofibrosis - prolif of granulocytes and megakaryocytes with depo of fibrosis 
- like 30% + asymptmatic but you get abdominal pain, thrombosis, hemorrhage, splenomegaly 
- peripheral blood - some left shift, 
	- early: inc platelets + wbc
	- late: cytopenias, tear drop RBCs, leukoerythroblastic with left granulocytes + nucleated rbcs 
- JAK2, CALR, MPL
- bone marrow: 
	- pre-fibrotic / cellular phase: hypercellular marrow, inc granulocytes + inc/abnormal **clustered circular lobed megakaryocytes**
	- fibrotic phase - inc fibrosis + **atypical megakaryocytes too**
	- prognosis - worse, 3-7 yrs fibrosis, death from bone marrow failure like hemorrhage/infection, 30% get AML
	TREAT: antithrombotics, JAK2 inhib, transplant

immature lymphoid neoplasms 
maturation block after hematopoietic stem cell has chosen to become lymphoid 
- all start in bone marrow then travel to blood then the periphery with b to the lymph nodes, t to the thymus 
precursor b cell neoplasms - broken down due to the lineage/genetic abnormalities 
B-ALL - **b lymphoblastic leukemia**
- most common malignancy of kids
- 20+% blasts in peripheral blod + bone marrow
- abrupt onset: fatigue, fever, bleeding, prolonged infection, bone pain, CNS involvement (**blasts will go into the nervous system)** lymphadenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly
- peripheral blood : has leukocytosis with lymphoblasts - huge - 
- bone marrow - hypercellular, sheets of lymphoblasts replacing ; don't tend to happen in lymph nodes
- morphology - **t and b the same blasts** - intermeiate in size, **very high nuc:cyt ratio!!1 scant agranular cytoplasm, no auer rods**
	- not always possible to tell them apart based on morphology - look at genetics 
- prognosis - overall good, but things associated with worse:
	- very young <2 yrs, older age 10+ yrs
	- high wbc at dx, and **philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)** - same thing in CML
	- better prognosis with hyperdiploidy 
THE BEST WAY TO TELL APART IN ACUTE LEUKEMIAS
- **flow cytometry - you can test for markers**
	- Immaturity markers: CD34, TdT, HLA-DR - 35 and TdT = **not as specific but tells you that it's a blast**
	- b cell line - **CD19**, CD22, **CD79a**
	- usually poz for CD10 
- lymphoblast - **PAS stain**
- myeloblasts: MPO, SBB, chloroacetate esterase CAE, NSE nonspecific esterase 

T-ALL t lymphoblastic leukemias
- 15% of childhood ALLs = more common in adolescents 
- 20+% blasts in peripheral and/or bone marrow - can happen in both lymph nodes (**lymphomas**) and bone marrow
	- maeks mediastinal mass with thymus involvement - 
- leukocytosis w/ lymphoblasts, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia all in periphery 
- flow cyt
	- markers; CD34, TdT imaturity 
	- T lineage - CD3, CD2, CD5, CD7 = **in the thymus they get CD4 and CD8... this is why we might have these! or both or neither!!!!**
- cytochem stains = lymphoblasts - PAS 
- cytogenetics - no major associations
