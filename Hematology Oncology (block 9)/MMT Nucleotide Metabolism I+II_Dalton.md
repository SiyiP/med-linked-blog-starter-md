- Azathioprine 3 purine synthesis inhibitor - inhibit the GPAT *not testable*
- ==**Leflunomide** 3 pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor== 
- ==**Methotrexate** 3 nucleotide metabolism inhibitor through dihydrofolate reductase inhibition (DNA synthesis); stops making it at the tetrahydrofolate level==
other: 
- ==**6-mercaptopurine** - purine synthesis inhibitor, inhibits GPAT== 
- aminopterin-> stops dihydrofolate reductase, stops that N5N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate regeneration ultimately 
- ==**5-fluorouracil** -> uracil memetic; suicide inhibitor, inhibits thymidylate synthase, disrupting dUMP -> dTMP==
- ==**trimethoprim** inhibits the bacterial dihydrofolate reductase...== 
- pyrumethamine - antiparasitic equivalent that binds to prozoal dihydrofolate
- ==**allopurinol - start several weeks after acute gout attack** - memetic for xanthine oxidase; hypoxanthine analog - will stop the hypoxanthine to xanthine and then its convesion to urate.== 
- ==**febuxostat** - second line, more selective for xanthine oxidase.== 

1. Introduction  
	1. a. General biological and clinical relevance 
		- activated precursors, atp/gtp, udp-glucose for biosynthesis, and cAMP signal transduction
		- diet is insufficient source - **they need to get synthesized!**
		- some drugs that impact nucleotide metabolism, some are DMARD - disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs - some are for chemotherapies. some are antifolate, and some are nucleotide/side analogs 
	2. b. Nomenclature 
![[nucleotide bases names nomenclature.png|432x210]]
base -nine, uracil 
ribonucleoSIDE - -sine for purines, -idine for the pyrimidines
ribonucleotide - -dylate for pyrimidines, -nylate for purines

majority of ADULT cells don't need de novo and just salvage is fine. but majority of fetus or cancer cells or immune cells (B+T cells) = they do de novo!!! 
1. De novo biosynthesis: Purine and Pyrimidine - building from very small building blocks; **PRPP + amino acids + ATP + CO2** -> nucleotide. **this is a chemo target as well as a target for over-active immune systems**
	1. a. Commonalities and differences between purine and pyrimidine synthesis 
		- they have many common blocks, like gettting the ==nitrogen from glutamine== 
		- ==bicarbonate, and aspartate too. also ATP== needed
		- ==PRPP== is also a commonality, activated form of ribose molecule. 
			- purines are larger, a few more structures needed! 
			- 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate = from the PPP, basically **PRPP synthetase adds ATP phosphate group to it**
		- ==**ring is made in pyrimidine FIRST, then attached to ribose unit**==
		- ==**purine ring is made AFTER attachment to the ribose unit**==
	2. b. Pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway 
		1. key precursors - bicarb, ammonia from glutamine and aspartate 
![[de novo pyrimidine]]
note - the only enzyme that's in the mt and not the cytoplasm is dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. inner mt membrane
![[pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway.png|432x335]]
CPS-2 = a multi step rxn 
- located in the cytoplasm 
- taking bicarb -> carboxyphosphate (activated w/ ATP) -> Carbamic acid when ammonia replace phosphate group -> carbamoyl phosphate at 2nd phosphorylation ATP
- recall: **CPS-2 has 3 domains with a glutamine hydrolysis site, then 2 more phosphorylation sites = TUNNELING**; it will grab onto the intermediates to prevent loss and labile intermediates are protected from hydrolysis. 
"CAD" = in higher eukaryotes like mammals, we fuse together **the first 3 enzymes in the chain!!!**
- together are: CPS2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase!!! CAD 
- go all the way from biarbonate to dihydroorotate, a closed ring structure just inside one enzyme 
	ATCase - will replace that phosphate on the carbamoyl phosphate with aspartate.
then dihydroorotase will dehydrate it to cyclize it 
OPRT (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase) enzymes will add ribose 5-phosphate to pyrimidine base with prpp, making orotidylate - OMP 
then, decarbosylate orotidylate with ODC to uridylate UMP - **very efficienct enzyme here.**
UMPS = **another fusion enzyme in mammals!!!**
- orotate phosphoribosyltransferase OPRT + orotidylate decarbosylase ODC = UMPs!!!
		1. -Clinical asides: DMARDs and hereditary orotic aciduria 
			1. note - DMARD **leflunomide** inhibits the synthesis by targeting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase!!! binding to a tunnel leading there... 
				- treatment of severe or mod rheumatoid arthritis + psoriatic arthritis; t cell expansion stopped.
				- overall the class can treat inflammatory diseases... but not all do target this nucleotide metabolism.
			2. high levels of orotic acid due to defects in UMPs, the fusion enzyme. basically megaloblastic anemia, severe mental/physical delays 
				1. Autosomal recessive
				2. treat with *uridine* UMP to bypass this lock (will make UMP automatically thru the salvage pathway)
				3. orotic aciduria - can also be due to blockage of urea cycle... like with this your carbamoyl phosphate in mitochondria will leak out, making high levels of orotic acid. 
					1. in this **urea cycle deficiency, blood urea would be high, NOT the megaloblastic anemia, which indicates having no nucleotides**
	- CTP = formed by amination of UTP... 
	- UTP = has a carbonyl, which must be replaced with nitrogen with CTP synthetase, **requires energy with glutamine and then the ATP will be used to replace that hydrogen with oxygen.**
---
continued
	3. Regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis - products are CTP and UTP, which will go back and inhibit : 
		1. CPS II = this is **the key regulatory step...** ; in the S-phase, where DNA is made, CPS-2 is more sensitive to PRPP activation and less so to UTP inhibition... then flipped at the end of S-phase. 
			1. this is phosphorylated by a MAP kinase 
			2. **will be activated by ATP**
		2. ATCase 
		3. ACTIVATION - happens when PRPP is higher. 
---
purine
	3. d. Purine biosynthesis pathway - they need both ==**glycine + N10fTHF for larger structures**== in addition to bicarb, ammonia from glutamine, aspartate
		1. larger ring structure - build while attached to that ribose. more complicated. 
		2. we make an initial purine ring *IMP*, and can make **either ATP or GTP**
			1. start with PRPP, **rate limiting enz is GPAT, glutamine phosphoribosyl amidotransferase** - will exchange that glutamine ammonia with the PRPP's phosphate group 
			2. GPAT = has 2 domains gln hydrolysis and amidotransferase
			3. also the target of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine 
		3. then there's like 9 steps.... know that **5 ATP molecules are used!!!!!! and 2 molecules of formyl THF are used**
		4. then you have the IMP inosinate... 
			1. adenylosuccinate synthase will add GTP and aspartate to make AMP, adenylate 
			2. IMP dehydrogenase + GMP synthetase will use ATP to make GMP , guanylate; basically adding carbonyl group with NAD+ and h2o, and then add amino from glutamine  
			3. we need to make sure we balance this, we can do that, **they drive the synthesis of each other!!!**
		5. -Clinical aside: Folate - purine synthesis is why you need folic acid in pregnancy to help fetal growth. 
	4. e. Regulation of purine biosynthesis 
		1. in order to make AMP. we need GMP, and so on 
		2. any buildup of AMP will inbhitit creation of gmp and vice versa 
		3. both of these molecules can inhibit GPAt(including AMP,GMP and IMP)
			1. not gonna be fully inhibited if only AMP is abundant, requires both. 
	5. f. Balancing nucleotide synthesis  - basically prpp synthetase, inhibited by amp, adp, etc.
---
1. Deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis - not a separate pathway, simply convert them to the deoxy form 
	1. a. Ribonucleotide reductase function and regulation 
		1. generally the only enzyme we realy use, we would turn the ribonucleotide to deoxyribonucleotide. 
		2. reduction of ribonucleotides, 2-hydroxyl reduced by **thioredoxin -> dNDP**
		3. reduced thioredoxin regen by NADPH from PPP 
		4. note - this happens in the DINUCLEOTIDE reductase form, like ADP -> dADP -> dATP reduction by ribonucleotide reductase then phosphorylation by nucleoside diphosphate kinases to get to dNTP form 
		the ribonucleotide does much regulation - 
			3 sites - active site, **activity control** allosteric site, and **specificity control** allosteric site 
			- activity decreased by abundance of deoxyATPs, or dNTPs, which will build up as product and decrease activity... 
			- activity upregulated by more ATP
			- specificity - when dATP is abundant, will bind to the specificity site, and then upregulate the binding of CDP and UDP instead ! - **just memorize the concept that binding of one dNTP will cause specificity of binding to other NDPs to go up!**
	2. b. Thymidine synthesis  - dUDP -> **dUTPase** will dephosphorylate it to dUMP monophosphate level -> ***thymidylate synthase will methylate*** it into TMP -> then **nucleoside monophosphate kinase** make it into TDP -> and **nucleoside diphosphate kinase** makes it into TTP 
		1. thymidylate synthase, takes the dUMP and then covalently links with cysteine into the active site, then will get **methyl group from** the **N5N10-methylentetrahydroofolate,** a folate derivative
		2. regen cycle - as we make TMP, we make dihydrofolate, which will get reduced with **dihydrofolate reductase's NADPH -> NADP+**, then makes tetrahydrofolate
			1. serine hydroxymethyl transferase takes serine -> glycine to reform that N5N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate
		3. -Clinical aside: 5-flurouracil/ DHFR inhibitors - we need thymidylate large quantities for more DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells. 
			1. fluorouracil -> fluorodeoxyuridylate F-dUMP; suicide inhibitor stops thymidylate synthase , when added with that enzyme it's stuck to it, long lived covalent intermediate
				1. antifolates - have antibacterial + antiprotozal activity. like trimethoprim inhibits the bacterial DHFR... 
				2. pyrumethamine - antiparasitic equivalent that binds to prozoal DHFR 
			2. aminopterin + methotrexate - > stops dihydrofolate reductase; these are **competitive inhibitors of this... not suicide inhibitors**  
2. Breakdown of nucleotides - nuclease - 
	1. common areas - similar steps - remove phosphates from nucleotides, then remove the ribose units, then break down the bases into small molecules 
	2. a. Breakdown of thymine -> ultimately b-amino-isobutyrate + CO2 + NH4+ 
		1. highlighted bc - **we create b-amino-isobutyrate, EXCLUSIVELY made from this degradation of thymine, a good marker for chemotherapy process** in excretement. 
	3. b. Breakdown of purines -> uric acid to be excretion ; also monitored in urine to look into chemo process 
		1. GMP and AMP; will remove that phosphate. 
			1. GMP - first remove the phosphates with nucleotidase, then the ribose molecule with nucleoside phosphorylase -> guanine, then demainate with guanine deaminase -> xanthine. 
			2. AMP -> nucleotidase remove phosphate, but then we deaminase it first with adenosine deaminase -> **inosine** -> then we nucleoside phosphorylase with removing the ribose, to get hypoxanthine. 
			3. hypoxanthine to xanthine with xanthin oxidase like below. -> oxidized it with H2o -> H2O2 with **xanthine oxidase** -> uric acid... 
				1. note. -in the process we make H2O2 - make ROS 
	4. Breakdown of cytosine from deamination-> uracil -> b-alanine + CO2 + NH4+, processed thru urea cycle 
	5. Nucleotide breakdown 
		1. i. ADA-SCID- adenosine deaminase ADA = **deficiency - will make SCID!!!!! this will be autosomal recessive, making loss of T cells** - only treated with bone marrow transplantation, enzyme replacement, etc.
		2. ii. Gout/ Allopurinol - red and swollen without trauma, hyperuricemia, can also be seen in the urine. **reduce amount of purines!**
			1. you build up a lot when you break down most of the nucleotides. 
			2. treatment - **allopurinol - start several weeks after acute gout attack** - memetic for xanthine oxidase

3. Salvage pathway nucleotide synthesis - most cells use to pick up bases free floating available from cell turnover to regenerate nucleotides - if we just break off phosphate and riboses and just leave those free bases, these can be in the bloodstream
	- **this is activated ribose PRPP + base**-> nucleotide 
	1. a. Purine and pyrimidine salvage pathway enzymes 
		1. purines - adenine/guanine + PRPP -> adenylate/guanylate + PPi 
			1. used by adenine phosphoribosyl-transferase APRT - special enzyme here on its own. 
			2. guanylate made by **hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase** HGPRT
			3. hypoxanthine (from adenosine breakdown)+PRPP -> inosinate + PPi 
		2. pyrimidines 
			1. uracil/cytosine + PRPP => uridylate or cytidylate + PPi 
			2. catalyzed by the **pyrimidine phosphoribosyl transferase** - no thymine relation
			3. also thymine + deoxyribose 1-phosphate -> thymidine. + Pi (**thymine phosphorylase**)
				1. **thymine is the exception that doesn't use PRPP**
	2. b. Genetic defects in salvage pathway enzymes
LNS - lesch-nyhan syndrome - mutation in HGPRT
- this is the purine salvage enzyme for guanine and hypoxanthine. 
- X linkd recessive, mostly males except females might get gout 
- buildup uric acid 
- neuro dysfunction + delays, **self injury + hostile behavior**, hyperuricemia - biting of lips and chewing on fingers. 
- severeity depends on specific mutations 
	- **allopurinol for gout, lithotripsy for kidney stones**
	- no neurological treatment ): 
	- poor prognosis living 1-2 decades. 
- mutation in HGPRT = cannot salvage guanine + hypoxanthine - basically they will be pushed to breakdown uric acid, then relieve inhibition of GPAT
	- **increased uric acid production with more breakdown**
	- increased PRPP bc not using as much = **this means less inhibition on PRPP synthetase, and more de novo synthesis too**
	- lower levels of GMP = stop inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase, excessive **purine synthesis, no more inhibition of GPAT**
allopurinol will treat this ... 

kelley-seegmiller 
- partial def of HGPRT, more de novo purine 
- gout + kidney stones, less neuro involvement

hyperactivity mutants of PRPP synthetase , more PRPP production 
- rare X linked, severe/mild form
- PRPP higher = GPAT and CPS2 activation more de novo purine synthesis 
- hyperuricemia, hyperuricosuria, gout 
- treat with allopurinol/febuxostat + low purines
