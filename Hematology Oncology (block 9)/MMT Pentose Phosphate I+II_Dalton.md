Introduction - it's also known as hexose monophosphate shunt - feeds off glycolysis and ultimately re-enters 
I. Overview of primary products and their functions
- glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD is the rate limiting enzyme. most common enzymopathy. 
pentose -> ribose 5 phosphate is the main product, made into prpp for nucleotides
phosphate - also generation of nadph to generate reducing powers. these are the key products!!! -> 
	reductive biosynthesis of FA, steroids, cholesterol, deoxynuc, neurotransmitters, and also making **reduced glutathione to defend ROS**! also makes ROS for host defense :P
- ribose 5 phosphate - synthesizing nuc acids + cofactors of ATP NAD, NADPH FAD CoA etc... also used to interconvert sugars... to convert the pentose sugars into glycolytic intermediates, generating atp
nad/nadh vs nadp/nadph
- nad+ = catabolic rxns, breakdown fuel moelcules
- nadh less abundant by far... so nad+ is valued as oxidizing agent particularly in glycolysis 
- NADPH = more abundant in cell than nadp+ ... so it's valued as reducing agent
