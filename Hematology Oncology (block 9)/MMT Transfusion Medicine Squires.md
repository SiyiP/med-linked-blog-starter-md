![[4. Transfusion Medicine I-The Basics_Squires_NOTES1.pdf]]- note this also has a notes section that is cumulative of all of his presentations. 
but we only are tested on whatever comes from the lectures and slides. 

what's transfused? 
- components - whole blood, rbcs, plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, granulocytes
- derivatives - factor 8,9, etc etc... all come out of pharmacy 
collection of whole blood - what comes out of the vein - mainly centrifused, getting rbcs on bottom, plasma on top, and separate the two. 
- all the antibodies are in the plasma. so in the rbcs there's antigens, and in the plasma has all antibodies 
- solution with citrate used to anticoagulate collected blood 
- apheresis - uses centrifugation into components. - will centrifuge into components 

all donors - risk factors - syphilis, hep, hiv/chagas, zika, etc. - all testing for these 

don't worry about blood component vol/storage, just have an idea - that rbcs have so much volume. might help you in knowing that you might wanna transfuse that much into a patient. 
- Leukoreduction LR - remove wbcs from red cell/platelet products - **makes you safe from CMV!!!**
- irradiation - using rays or gamma - **makes lymphocytes unable to proliferate, preventing GvHD in immunocomp patients!**
- Washing - removes plasma on red cell and plasma units with some saline... 

immunohematology - biggest thing 
rbc - has surface of carbohydrates, glycoproteins, etc. antigens. 
- if person's exposed to rbcs other than their own thru preg/transfusion, small genetic variations in these can be immunologically recognizable, resulting in antibody prod
