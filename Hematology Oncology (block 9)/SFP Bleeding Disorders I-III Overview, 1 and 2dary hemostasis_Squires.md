*make a flowchart?*
causes = defect in primary hemostasis platelet plug, in secondary hemostasis fibrin plug, and fibrinolysis - 3 categories 

primary hemostasis - bv, platelets, von willebrane dz
secondary - clotting factors
fibrinolysis - tPA, PAI-1, and alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor 
misc coagulopathies - DIC, TTP 

what matters for this lecture - evaluation of abnormal bleeding? 
- happens after many situations
- med hx, phys exam, lab testing ofc 
med hx 
- bleeding hx - extent of bleeding? location, appearance, age of onset
- medical hx - meds? dental/surgical procedures, liver/kidney dz 
- fm hx - females males or both, any hx of consanguinity? 
**physical exam - VERYYY important to know**
- defect primary hemostasis - platelet count or functionality issue
	- bleeding gums mucocutaneous
	- superficial bruising/petechiae 
	- low platelets 
- defect in 2ndary hemostasis - inhibiting or deficiencies in coag factors
	- soft tissue hematomas, 
	- **extensive bruising**
	- hemarthroses - **bleeding into a joint space**
	- more PT or PTT - meaning **prolnged prothrombin time or partial prolonged prothrombin time**
evaluation - we should know that a bleeding abnormality actually exists
routine panel - **CBC, PT, PTT, platelet count, sometimes fibrinogen/thrombin time**
- primary hemostasis - platelets
	- platelet count/morpho = normal is 150k to 400k uL. 
		- below 150k uL is adequate for hemostasis. 
		- morhpology - not too much, new platelets are fatter... so higher mean platelet volume MPV suggest increased peripheral destruction of platelets bc the newly released type are larger. - decreased MPV = failure in bone marrow
		- **bernard-soulier syndrome = fat platelets**
	- bleeding time - poorly reproducible - time to stop bleeding , normal is 9-11 min, but is not reproducible so they stopped. 
	- light transmission aggregometry- do these platelets work well @ all?? 
		- agonists of collagen, epinephrine, ADP all cause platelets to aggregate.
		- can make a platelet rich plasma PRP , **a ton of platelets**, then we pass light thru it for baseline. 
		- then we ad an agonist = which causes them to stick together. - 
			- **platelet aggregates and solution lets more light transmission than the original suspension**
			- aggregation pattern depending on the agonist can separate two diseases 
			- graph shows time vs optical density to look at the turbidity (goes down on normal aggregation.)
	- verify now 
	- tests for vWillebrand dz - several variants are seen 
		- will measure von willebrand factor antigen to assay it 
		- ristocetin cofactor - measures amount of FUNCTIONAL von willebrane factor 
		- multimer analysis - since von willebrand factor is large and multimeric, but in certain diseases some subunits are missing. gel electrophoresis to check size ultimately 
- 2ndary - make sure to focus on pt/ptt 
recall intrinsic pathway 12,11,9.8,10 tenant // tweleve eleven nine ate ten 
common pathway - 10, 5, 2, 1; 
extrinsic pathway = 7 
if there's prolonged PT/PTT, it means there's either deficiency or inhibitor (IgG antibody present that's blocking this action)
	- PT - star - **meaning that even tho aPTT and PT assess common path, PT is MORE SENSITIVE to common path deficiencies. so deficiencies in 10,5,2,1 can be prolonged PT but normal in PTT**
		- this is extrinsic and common - 7.10,5.2,1
		- to monitor oral anticoagulant/warfarin therapy 
	- PTT- aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time = **measure of intrinsic AND common pathways**
		- normal = 23-26 s= youo'll be given this 
		- to detect a def of 12,11,9,8,10 , prekallikrein, HMWK, fibrinogen , 5,2,1 
			- HMWK = high molecular weight kininogen = can screw up the ptt reading. just be aware of this even when it's not in your pathway 
		- note - **prekalikrein, HMWK, factor 12 are all measured by the ptt - but non can result in bleeding risk**
		- monitors heparin therapy and testing for lupus 
	- mixing studies - combining pt + ptt = if ptt prolonged = 
		- difficiency in factors of 12,11,9,8,10,5,2,1
	- but if normal pt says 10,5,2, 1 are normal.... 
		- **only 12,11,9,8 are gonna be prolonging the ptt**
also if the prolonged pt but normal ptt - 
- prolonged pt = think that 7,10,2,1,5 are deficient 
- but normal ptt says 10,5,2,1 are normal. 
- only factor is 7 = the cause 
only exception - **mild deficiency of 10,5,2,1 might be detected by pt but missed by ptt**
- so a mild def of 10,5,2,1 might yield a prolong pt but normal ptt 
if they're BOTH messed up = think multiple factor deficiencies, think vitamin K def or severe liver dz. 
	-INR - international normalized ratio normalizes pt testing from one institution to another. 
	- mixing study - **if you have a pt and aPTT, due to deficiency or inhibitor.... we should see what alternative is causing this abnormally**
		- example = used to evaluate and distinguish factor def vs inhibitor. 
		- normal plasma x deficient plasma = **normal coagulation result** = factor deficiency ... the deficiency CORRECTS. 
		- abnormal result meaning it will still be prolonged is if there is an inhibitor. does NOT correct! 
	- thrombin time - TT, time for the fibrin clot to form after thrombin addition. measures from the common pathway with the addition of thrombin aka factor II 
		- prolonged with some inbhititors or with some fibrin degradation products etc. 
	- factor assays - if it's a factor deficiency - which factor is involved?? 
		- but if it's an inhibitor present = they measure them out with **bethesda unit!!!! = this is the quantity of inhibitors**
	- fibrinogen - we don't need to know how to measure it ... 100 mg/dL + is usually adequate for coagulation
		- useful in times of **emergency - DIC and liver failure or primary fibrinolysis , which guides a transfusion study**
- clot stability / fibrinolysis
	- **D-dimer = most important assay - one of the fragments released when plasmin breaks down fibrin. really huge in DIC dx. pretty common** 
		- you must make fibrin polymer, and then factor 13 will **crosslink it to make it more stable.**
		- d dimer - the crosslinked thing from the fibrin polymer. 
	- tissue plasminogen activator
	- plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1 
	- factor XIII fibrin stabilizing factor 
- whole blood clotting tests - looks at all the things together. 
	- **viscoelastometry** = used frequently in transplant, studies, etc
	- thromboelastography - TEG - measure clot formation as a whole.... fast ish output in time. 
		- don't learn these just know the tracings exist. 
		- know the thromboelastograph results to get an idea of what we might need in clotting etc.
