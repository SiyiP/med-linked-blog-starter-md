#hemonc 
bleeding disorders - inc in anti-clotting or fibrinolytic, decrease in clotting 
hyper-coagulability - formation of thrombic
3 components of normal hemostasis - vascular wall (endothelium + ECM), platelets, coagulation cascade
injury -> local response (endothelin vasoconstrictor early and brief neurogenic reflex, exposure of blood collagen) -> primary hemostatic plug with adherence of platelets + secretion that attract others -> secondary plug (activation of coagulation cascade, endothelial cells that secrete tissue factor, thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin, which makes a permanent plug with platelets)
-> after plug formation, counterregulation in place where endothelial cells secrete t-PA tissue plasminogen activator, initiating steps to fibrolysis, when thrombin binds thrombomodulin, inhibitation of coagulation cascade is initiated

endothelial cells - normally antithrombic, but injured prothrombic, regulators of thrombus formation
- this will make a **barrier between platelets + ECM, stopping platelet activation**
- thrombin binding stimulates secretion of PGI2 and NO to inhibit it more 
- **endothelial adenosine diphosphatase** degrades ADP , inhibits platelets more 
- heparin like molecules and thrombomodulin inactivate clotting factors 
- T-PA synthesized to clear fibrin 
- TFPI = **tissue factor pathway inhibitor inhibits factors 7 + 10**
pro-thrombic activity in damaged vessel 
- secretes von willebrand factor, helps platelet binding to collagen 
- cytokines = TNF, IL1, endootoxins make TF secretion (tissue factor, **extrinsic clotting pathway activated**)
	- cells will bind activated clotting factors IX, X
	- secreting inhibitors of tPA = **PAI to stop fibrinolysis**

platelet contributions to hemostasis 
- made up of alpha granules (fibrinogen, fibronectin, cofactors V + VIII, platelet factor 4 binds heparin, PDGF, TGF b, P selectin)
- dense core granules - serotonin, epinephrine, histamine, ADP, ATP, Ca
prothrombic activity - adherence is mediated by vWF factor... 
ca++ - essential in coagulation cascade steps 

aggregation agents = in addition to ADP, platelets will secrete thromboxane 2 TXA2 (inhibited by aspirin , PGI-2 inhibits this)

contraction - reversible - action of coag cascade + fibrin to clot -> makes 2ndary plug 
binding of thrombin (product of coag cascade to platelet -> fibrinogen to fibrin)
- fibrinogen cleavage makes fibrin + fibrin split products FSP (attract monocytes + neutrophils into plug)

coagulation cascade 
![[coag factors charg.png|543x364]]

intrinsic and extrinsic component 
![[coagulation cascade]]

inhibitors of cascade = 
- antithrombin III which binds heparin-like molecules on endothelial cells - inhibits intrinsic pathway
- thrombomodulin - binds thrombin, activates protein S, inactivating V + VIII- common pathway
- TFPI - inhibits factor X and VII
