ANA test + anti-dsDNA antibodies for SLE initial dx 
ESR - highest sed rate is gonna be the one with the smallest blood line (the shortest one), happening settling fast on that! 
direct coombs - antibodies already bound to rbcs 
indirect coombs - antibodies in the serum 

CASE 1: Painful Hands  
A 30-year-old woman employed as an administrative assistant saw her primary care physician complaining of pain in both hands. Her first painful episode had occurred two weeks earlier, when walking outside on the first cold day of fall. At the time she noticed that all her fingers turned white and felt numb for about 10 minutes, then became purple. She had friends take pictures. When she warmed her hands, the fingers turned red and felt excruciatingly painful. She suffered three additional similar episodes over the next two weeks.  
- raynaud's, bilateral pain in hands 
- ask about: hiking in conneticuit - tick bite causing this? 
- ask about: joint pain 

**autoimmune ROS**
- weight loss, fever, rash, hair loss, eye inflammation, dry mucosa, SOB, acid reflux(esp in scleroderma), oral/nasal ulceration, proximal muscle weakness, pleuritic chest pain, hematuria, joint pain/swelling 

Past medical history: none  
Family history: no cancer, grandmother with **scleroderma**  
Social history: No tobacco or etoh use. She vacationed in Connecticut earlier in the year.  
Physical exam: Temperature 37.6ºC, P 78, Resp 12, BP 126/76  
Gen: well appearing, no distress  
HEENT: normal optic fundi, no oral ulcers  
Lungs: CTA bilaterally  
Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs, gallops or rubs  
Abdomen: +bs, soft, non-tender, non-distended, no bruits  
Ext: radial and ulnar pulses 2+, no ulcerations on her fingertips  
Skin: warm and of normal color and texture.  
MSK: no erythema or swelling of her joints  

Your team will be asked to:  
• Develop a problem representation  
**30 year old healthy female with family hx of scleroderma presents with 2 wks hx of pain associated with raynaud's phenomenon**
• Develop a differential diagnosis  - fair to keep the DDx broad at this point! 
- cold agglutinin dz
- cryoglobulin-  
- Peripheral occlusive vascular dz 
- primary raynaud's 
- systemic sclerosis
- mixed ct dz 
- drug rxn ergot- these are for migraines, be aware of this! 
- chloesterol emboli + thromboangiitis obliterans 

raynauds color changes:
vasoconstriction = pale; pallor 
o2 dec + venous stasis = blu
rebound hyperemia = red, bvs open back up and let blood thru 
we really worry about this if it's **prolonged or if there's ulcerations associated with this!**
- how abrupt are these coming up? good and important to know 
- what causs pain? ischemia + metabolic products (ros from that)

• List appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm or refute your diagnostic hypotheses  
ANCA-> think about centromeres or nucleolar 
calcium count / complement count? 
nail folds caplliroscopy

top 3 to order
- ANA
- Scl-70 
- CBC + diff 

dsDNA = only for lupus, if screening ANA is poz 
antinuc antibodies = braod 


• Interpret laboratory results to refine your diagnosis  
ana = homogenous? broad staining doesn't tell us much . 
negative for Scl-70 
differential = looks good 
antiphospholipids = negatives, normal coag tests 

SPEP = spike or not? 
- we all got that first initial spike
- not worried , this might be something that we can check out later , more of a bigger more broad peak that could mean inflammation 
so it can be: drug epxosure, primary raynaud

• Determine the final diagnosis
primary raynaud's! this can also happen in toes/ears/nose/lips 
no specific treatment and avoid cold 

cryoglobulinemia VS raynauds?
- cryoglobulinemia = this is more widespread, affecting tip of nose, vasculitis, many microthrombi which are present (this is the differentiating factor of the condition)
- ulcerations due to microthrombi, could be more severe

CASE 2  
A 59-year-old male presents to your office complaining of increased fatigue, pain, stiffness in  
the joints in his hands and swelling in his feet and ankles for a week. He has a history of COPD  
and congestive heart failure requiring two hospitalizations in three years, but he states his lower  
extremity swelling “feels different” than his normal edema and he has been experiencing  
increased stiffness in his hands and ankles for a few months. The stiffness is more pronounced  
in the mornings.  
He denies any recent infections, shortness of breath or chest pain, but his wife states he has  
been experiencing a decreased appetite and pain in both hands for two months. He reports  
taking all of his medication on schedule, including furosemide (Lasix) which he recently began  
taking, and denies using his inhaler in more than a month. ROS: unsure about weight changes,  
no fevers, no rashes, no Raynaud’s, no vision changes, no dry mouth or eyes, no oral ulcers  
- stiffness in joints of hands , more in mornings 
- swelling in ankles + feet 
- copd - lungs maybe think of the scleroderma? SOB, no appetite, 
ask about family hx - **does it get better with movement** (could differentiate between this and arthritis)
dry mouth + dry eyes for a few months? 

Past medical history: COPD and CHF  
Family history: Mother with “joint problems”  
Social history: Married, no pets. No travel out of state in past year. Social etoh use (less than 5  
drinks/week), former smoker (40 pack years, no longer smoking)  
Rx: Furosemide 40 mg/day, Albuterol inhaler as needed  
Physical exam: 6’1’’, 264 lbs, Temp: 98.9°F, P 84, Resp: 21, BP 140/90,  
Gen: obese male, no distress  
HEENT: normal optic fundi, no oral ulcers  
Neck: JVP not elevated  
Lungs: prolonged expiratory phase, occasional scattered expiratory wheezes, no crackles, no  
increased WOB  
Cardiac: regular, normal S1, S2, no murmurs or gallops  
Abdomen: protuberant, +bs, soft, NT, ND  
Ext: no pretibial pitting edema  
Skin: no rashes  
MSK: MCPs and PIPs swollen and warm bilaterally, with moderate decreased range of motion;  
decreased grip strength; ankles are swollen, tender, decreased range of motion  

Your team will be asked to:  
• Develop a problem representation  

**59 year old male w/ PMH of COPD and CHF with family hx of "joint problems" presents with increased fatigue, pain, stiffness in the joints in his hands and swelling in his feet and ankles for a week**
- "polyarticular, symmetric arthritis"

patterns of arthritis 
![[image 2.png]]
in noninflammatory arthritis, we see AM stiffness not lasting more than 30 min, bony hypertrophy bc it's reacting to that, so you see osteophytes. 

knees - get osteoarhtritis 
wear and tear arthritis, but ankles don't get that pain/swelling - > if they have it, think of mechanical inuries or autoimmune! 

• Develop a differential diagnosis  
- scleroderma 
- RA
- ankylosing spondylitis
- psoriatic arthritis ? - maybe present with the pain before the rash? 
- he did have some pancreas issues? but lower on the diff maybe it's IgG4 related dz 

• List appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm or refute your diagnostic hypotheses  


• Interpret laboratory results to refine your diagnosis  
• Determine the final diagnosis
rheumatoid arthritis

CASE 3: Sunburn and Seizure  
A 25-year-old physical therapist, was brought to the ED by her husband after having a  
generalized seizure. When she regained consciousness, she gave a history of feeling tired over  
the previous three weeks, to the point that she was breathless and exhausted after climbing to  
her second-floor apartment. She also complained of the progressive development of pain and  
stiffness in her wrists and fingers. She had noticed what looked like a bad sunburn on her cheeks and had been running a slight fever (38.2ºC).  - butterfly rash  
ROS: +weight loss, no vision changes, no red eyes, no hair loss, no dry mouth, no chest pain, no   

Raynaud’s  
Past Medical History: 2 first trimester miscarriages in the past three years.  
Social History: no tobacco use, occasional alcohol use, no recreational drugs.  
Medications: None  
Physical exam: Vitals: Temperature 38.6ºC, pulse 90/min, BP 135/60mmHg and weight 64.5 kg  
(loss of 3 kg in three weeks)  
General: well-nourished, no distress  
HEENT: normal optic fundi, no oral ulcers  
Lungs: CTA bilaterally  
Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs, gallops or rubs  
Abdomen: +bs, soft, non-tender, non-distended  
Skin: erythematous patches over the cheeks  
MSK: Hands and wrists were warm. Joints were boggy and painful to palpation with limited range  
of motion  
Neuro: Alert and oriented. CN II-XII intact, strength 5/5 bilaterally, reflexes 2+ in upper and lower  
extremities  
Your team will be asked to:  
• Develop a problem representation  
• Develop a differential diagnosis  
• List appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm or refute your diagnostic hypotheses  
• Interpret laboratory results to refine your diagnosis  
• Determine the final diagnosis
support lupus: 
- SM antibodies , dsDNA, iron studies in reticulocyte count bc she is anemic 
- positive coombs test - think hemolytic anemia too 

the MRI- shows a vascular leak, so the vasculature in brain is comprmoised, now the wbcs now have access to the brains to cause inflammation + elevated protein levels in the csf 
steroids might reduce seizures bc it would 
- reduce immune system inflammation as a result of the vascular leak 
**seizures = the most frequent neurologic abnormalities in SLE, might have a cns vasculitis, microthrombi, small vessle vasculopathy, metabolic encephalopathy etc.**
her skin abnormalities of rashes - **common manifestations of immune complex dz, uv light inducing widespread breaks in DNA, so release of this is a starting point of making immune complexes form, but they're dysfunctional or not able to act up right, staying deposited in the joints.**
