case 1 
58 yo - 1 mon hx worsening abd pain, jaundice, weight losss
- pain in upper abdomen - radiate to back + t2dm 
- no hx alc consumption but smoking hx 
liver problems going on + lfts, bilirubin, alk phos 
- suggest dx tests of lipase , ultrasound -> show a hypoechoic mass at head of bancrease, and dilation of common bile duct + intrahepatic bile ducts 
- on the histo slide - we see confirmed distal common bile duct obstruction - tissue samples taken - adenocarcinoma of small glands, small mucin collections
- samples sent to genetic testing + multigene panel assay -> based on that we got dx of pancreatic cancer/adenocarcinoma of pancreas 
- elevated levels of serum carboohydrate antigen CA = 19-9 is still elvated = malignancy 
- mutation in breast cancer susceptibility in brca1/2 and partner/localizer of brca 2 = palb2 

therapeutic drug = think - what is the mechanism of BRCA1/2 = **these genes for DNA repair!!!!**
- cisplatin = **DNA damaging agent** - this is what you should go for!!!!
- double strand breaks = hazardous, and then repaired by homologous recomb (high-fidelity) and nonhomologous (low fidelity).... and BRCA1/2 work in homologous recombination, so if targetted we get better outcomes. 

for metastatic cancer - comb regimins will combine leucovorin modulated 5-fu with oxaliplatin +/0 irinotecan = highe response rates
- adding leucovorin = **is to enhance inhibition of thymidylate synthase - leucovorin is used differently with methotrexate vs 5-FU**
	- [[-MMT Chemotherapeutic Agents I+II_Tew]]
- most adverse SE - 5-FU usage = mucositis = the ulcers!!! 

why they introduced irinotecan in her chemotherapeutic regimen 
- to do single strand breaks
and how can intestinal bacteria influence toxicity of irinotecan? 
- **they can reactivate the irinotecan back to the active form**
	- they get metabolized into their active form, then put into the bile. then they get cleaved by the bacterial intestinal things, reabsorbed into epithelial cells etc. 
	- intestinal efflux into lumen thru the marp2 and into blood via mrp1 
	- glucoronidase bacteria is the key for its reabsorption 

given oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, 5-fu. - she began to get tinnitus + fluctuating mild high freq hearing loss . 
- oxaliplatin - platin drugs known for = nephrotox, **ototox**, some neurotox
- hugely detrimental to the hearing loss 

prior, she was given ondansetron to reduce n/v - 
==important receptors regulating n/v==
- ==serotonin 5HT3 receptors==
- ==dopamine D2== 
- ==neurokinin-1== 
- ==histamine H1== 
- ==muscarinic ach receptors== 

parp inhibitors used a lot for BRCA1/2 mutations

case 2 
stenosing mass in sigmoid colon + biposy shows adenocarcinoma.... T4N2M1 + lymp node metastases 
- **colon cancer is on the rise. death @ 32 etc.**
![[apple core colon.png]] - indicator of colorectal cancer

insicion wound that opens a wound would be = **depletion of endothelial growth factors = wound healing is huge in EGF!!!!!!**
- bevacizumab = binding VEGF!! starves the tumor of angiogenesis but it will also suppress collagen production + crosslinking 
- other AEs = **perforation, MI, thrombosis is major !!!!**

cetuximab = EGFR.... what dramatically reduces cetuximab activity???
- antibody - Kras is downstream of EGF. 
- RASH = a side efect
Raf V600E gain of function mutation observed... so **so**RAFenib = effective to combat. 
sometimes Ras or Raf are mutated. 
- either or is enough for tumor to mutate!
- Raf = melanoma mainly 

**microsatellite instability - multiple repeats of something = basically dna replication makes a ton of mistakes = this is microsatellites. instability means some of those are repeats in coding sequences or mutations = now new proteins that are made with some in the cell surface.** 
- you will get more NEOANTIGENS = **most common in colorectal cancer - you get numerous neoantigens, which can be recognized by the host immune system, like CYTOTOXIC T CELLS!!! TO AVOID THIS, CANCER CELLS WILL OVEREXPRESS PD-L1!!!!! SO YOU NEED TO GIVE PEMBROLIZUMAB**

case 3 
13 yo male, acute lymphoblastic leukemia. given mercaptopurine 
- **thiopurine 5-methyltransferase** - know that there are many polymorphisms in this!!!! 

- watch out for assigning allopurinol + 6-mercaptopurine at the same time
- ==**specifically tumor lysis syndrome = hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, elevated sr creatinine**== 
- - PUK-calcium from tumor lysis syndrome = Phosphate Uremia K+ up, all go up; and calcium goes down 
			- biggest thing is to give fluid to keep the kidneys safe, IVF
			- hyperkalemia = insulin (give w sugar)
			- phosphate binders
			- allopurinol for prevention, and rasburicase for treatment -> prevention of gout 
failure of 2+ agents with different moa - think of transporter resistance = efflux happens

chemo terms
- neoadjuvant chemo - chemo given be4 surg 
- adjuvant = wipe out what's left post-surg
- induction chemo - used to induc a remission = to treat acute leukemias
- consolidation chemo - to sustain remission = aka "intensification therapy = more for acute leukemias"
- maintenance chemo - lowwer doses to prolong remission - only acute lymphocytic leukemias + APML
- second line chemo - only if first line fails or it's not good = "salvage therapy"
- palliative chemo - to address symptom management without expecting to significantly reduce the cancer
