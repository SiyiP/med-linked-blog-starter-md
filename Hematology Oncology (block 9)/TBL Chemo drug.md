case 1 
58 yo - 1 mon hx worsening abd pain, jaundice, weight losss
- pain in upper abdomen - radiate to back + t2dm 
- no hx alc consumption but smoking hx 
liver problems going on + lfts, bilirubin, alk phos 
- suggest dx tests of lipase , ultrasound -> show a hypoechoic mass at head of bancrease, and dilation of common bile duct + intrahepatic bile ducts 
- on the histo slide - we see confirmed distal common bile duct obstruction - tissue samples taken - adenocarcinoma of small glands, small mucin collections
- samples sent to genetic testing + multigene panel assay -> based on that we got dx of pancreatic cancer/adenocarcinoma of pancreas 
- elevated levels of serum carboohydrate antigen CA = 19-9 is still elvated = malignancy 
- mutation in breast cancer susceptibility in brca1/2 and partner/localizer of brca 2 = palb2 

therapeutic drug = think - what is the mechanism of BRCA1/2 = **these genes for DNA repair!!!!**
- cisplatin = **DNA damaging agent** - this is what you should go for!!!!
- double strand breaks = hazardous, and then repaired by homologous recomb (high-fidelity) and nonhomologous (low fidelity).... and BRCA1/2 work in homologous recombination, so if targetted we get better outcomes.
