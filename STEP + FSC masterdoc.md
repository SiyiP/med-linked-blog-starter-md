start right after block 12 exam?? dec 17 ??? 
goals for CBSE? / summer + make a plan for dedicated???

note - 40 qs/block - each block 60 min and can't get back in 
 - do 5 min / block instead of going str8 in
 - beteen 4-5 , take lunch?
 - maybe 3-4 take longer
 - more breaks end of day 
 - eye drop 
 - 1-guided, 3rd party (anki, sketchy, pathoma.?), note taking routine for cum. review, pract tests, simulation
	 - have note taking routine prepped for dedicated 
	 - work in sets of 10-12 - write up notes as we go 
	 - **sort your qs by system and/or subject instead of random!!!**
	 - scaffold based on hammer best - might help you out? 
	 - if you don't want immediate feedback do exam mode with 2x time
	 - 1 hr - make notes *only* on missed questions so you have time back. DONT ctrl c / v
	 - cross it off for the right reason? what's this i've never heard of? 
- note taking: 
	 - A list - "need to know" cards - anki 
	 - B list - "nice to know" cards- anki
	 - parking lot - anything you'd want more time on etc - add here to revisit later 
"weekly review day" - set agenda at begining of day/evening be4. - 
- decide - get active in review - organize notes? - tags? missed tag? etc. 
- high yield parking lot info - **have dedicated parking lot time**
- 3rd party materials on some topics. - sketchy, pathoma, FA etc 
- sets of 10-20 missed qs 
- base off old nbmes - what am i weak on?
pract tests - nbmes
- 200 qs , 4-5 hrs 
- stop the clock - use CAE/WC computer lab colbert 408 - simulated testing  you can go whenever. 
nbmes - don't just rely on this bc it's shorter... just represents the breadth of knolwedge
- better to do free120 eetc. 

**dedicated** 8-10 hrs/day, 6 days/wk 
possibility 
- 6am - review
- 7-11 - qs in sets of 10-12
- 11-11:30 lunch
- 11:30-2:30 - sets of 10-12
- 2:30-3:30 review

anki - 2 hrs in total? 
10 am then 8-9 pm - 
if you're 90% sure, uncover all distractors
if not
- uncover 1 choice at a time "can i elim?"
- 3 showing? elim 1 
do maybe a missed question excel sheet?
	question based on what you'ree unsure about + the answer on a diff column + tags (system etc)
**don't just copy the entire explaination** - how do you need to take your notes about this? 


---
there's many hammer ones 
- 325 total hammer 1s
many focus on 1-3s mainly 
maybe 4s? 
5s "not rlly worth the time"
- "bonus questions" - idk just when you have time, 
---
- work back from test date, put in things you dont move etc.
- 1 day be4 = rest day 
- 3-5 days be4 = final review
- 7-10 days be4 = a full length mock exam NBME + Free 120
when start? weekly rest/review days?  schedule 3-4 nbmes. 
- half rest half review? partner day off etc. 
- **practice exams schedule 1-2 day after review days** - do it when u finish h1-2 and or AFTER 3 weeks of study 
daily q quotas - resonably - 60-100 qs. 
- start with 80qs? 26 days to work, that's like 100% of h1-3 2080 qs

some more resources for assignments posted in brightspace for implementation 
**IRB proposal due Dec 1 2025, coompletion f IRB quality improvement self cert Dec 1, and req for data needed due then too** = this is all important for the research track specifically 

no matter what you need to do nov 21 citi certification + eIRB registration 
more paths hav in person, virt, and async learning modules

now to december - think about familiarity to ISP, initial review, realism. 
- good accomplishment - get familiar with your resources. 
- put together a good calendar. 
step 1 study tracks - we can switch tracks based on practice exam performance 
track 1 - required for dart?
- ==**step taken by feb 15 , flex begins day after = 6 wks to do step 1**== 
==track 2 - take by mar 15 , then flex the day after = 8 wks to do step 1 , 10 if we count holidays== 
- **composite score <86, *OR* CBSE <47** - either one ; our march 16 day is still so. we have to abide by this. 
track 3 - ppl participating in PAR
- take by apr 12, then begin on Apr 13 
track 4 - NIH funded research, takes it feb 1st 
==**people can practice in computer center 408 ECL**== = do these to take the practice test - sign up in advance! 
step1hotline@musc.edu - in december - helping you to have urgent concerns 
individual sessions/calls 

==NBME Score Targets: Passing at least two NBME practice exams with a minimum score of 65% indicates a 96% chance of passing within the next 2 weeks==

basic dedicated typical ISP
- daily q-based review - stp 1 areas
- new questions 4-5 days/week, 6+ weeks 
- some review time daily 
- one cumulative review day/week - meaning we look thru all the things we already reviewed that week and more? 
- 1/2 or full day off 
- CBSE ~2-4 practice NBME, free 120 ; often we take more NBMEs... 4-5 average taken.
time commitment - 
- ==5.5-6.5 days a week== 
- ==avg: **9-5 hours a day!!!**==
- maintain your wellness activities ofc! 
==have some wide open time scheduled to deal with areas of weakness!==


timeline 
July - step1 small group workshops 
break/ace in august beginning
block 10 sept 18 
10b oct 9 exam
block 11 in oct-november
==**CBSE nov 24-25, beginning of block 12!!!**==
Dec 17 
ACE on 30-31 
**submit - step 1 study plan jan 5th, on the study course**- 2 credit hour course P/F
- primarily independent study for us. there's some reqs and structures here though. 
- reqs - cbse, submit study plan, achieving min threshold score(given later) on nbme practices in simulated testing environments , submit full pdf of our final cbssa score, then take step 1 
review mastery sheets, cbse results, CAE in creating it 
- whats the areas of strength/weakness for blocks + CBSE
- testtaking strats 
- consider - acaemics, nbme, amboss use too (% completion not success - need to balance questions + weekly cumulative review of concepts = seen in small group)
==good success==
- ==**initial NBME 47+** (take this in NOVEMBER!!!!)==
- ==**composite grade 86%+**== 
- ==**achieving 65+ equated percent correct on multiple nbme in stimulated environment**== 

CAE in step1 study planning overview - develop a nice study plan by jan 5th, which will help you sset up 

280 qs, not all are counted, some are unscored, like 
7 x 60 minute blocks each with 40 MC questions. - there's some new or experimental items
most are clinical vinetas. some have tables similar to EMR charts. 
	btw 1 hr of break time, but complete the tutorial (15 min) the day prior to skip it 
	do stuff in 15 min rest time betweeen blocks 

content specs - 45-50% path, some pharm, micro, anatomy etc. 
more physio, moooore micro, immune, anatomy and less biochem+nutrition
**registration in mid september!!!**
- need to get scheduling permit to select exam day; student affairs need to verify. 
- choose a 3 month window to take it - **bc it's expensive to adjust it)):**
- CBSE scores + composite ones - predict how much time I need
- might wanna wait until you have a baseline - **Nov 24-25**!!!! but regardless... 
NBME reg - mid sept 22 tentatively 
- reg fee 680$ bruh - be realistic with window + exam date ): most ppl doing it feb - mar window. 
- NBME CBSSA practice exam costs - 
	- 6 forms
	- 62$ each, but we get 2 free vouchers 

amboss in preclerkship 
there's not a huge 3r yr curriculum - the sooner you do it the better. 
amboss for step prep - 
- just make sure - you can make a study plan based on rotations
- amboss for learning - articles are helpful and good - quick tips - 
	- turn on key exam info - highlighting without having it all go away. 
	- articles written very well 
on amboss questions - make sure you're using these to learn, know that well. 
what in the q stem mislead me to believe i was wrong? what did i need to pick out to get this q stem right? 
- if you don't remember much or know much about it, that means you have to read the artcile 
- know all the other answer choices too. 
CVSE - **used to determine ur track for step... right be4 thanksgiving. take it super seriously**
- this is before block 10 - incorperate it into your week!!! block it out in your schedule. 

amboss - has high yield stuff - amboss - use one of these. 
they also got score predictors
- **200 concepts in every step 1 exam is good for this - breaks it into different systems, good to start off** 

step schedules 1 - 
step 1 - do yours by system.. will be sent out 
do one hammers, then the systems based? 
- do amboss for the block you're in?? - work in the step prep beforehand 
- start with older blocks? 
- doing 5 qs of your current block maybe and then the other one. 

1. NBME creation
2. apply for step 1 + pay fee
3. verify id online 
4. musc enrollment confirmed by stu affairs
5. testing permit issued
6. schedule test date via prometric center 
deadline - oct 15 

**i have access to cofc and the citadel libraries with my MUSC badge???????**
