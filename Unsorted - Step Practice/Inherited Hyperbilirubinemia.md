Lab Readings: 
- bilirubin serum >= 1.1 mg/dL (isolated)
- isolated hyperbilirubinemia + no liver enzyme change 
Symptoms 
- transient jaundice primary symptom, mild presentation + good prognosis 

Clinical Manifestation 
- either conjugated or unconjugated
	- unconjugated bilirubin/**indirect** = excess release = 
		- hemolytic anemia 
		- defective conjugation = gilbert syndrome + crigler-najjar syndrome
	- direct bilirubin = conjugated = defective excretion 
		- dublin-johnson syndrome
		- rotor syndrome 

Defective Conjugation + Unconjugated Bilirubin/Indirect
Crigler-Najjar / Gilbert Syndrome 
	Individuals with [[Crigler-Najjar syndrome]] or Gilbert syndrome *cannot* ConjuGate [bilirubin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Ln0wFg#Z07a8a4f4a850245bf742b6a98121b3e0).

[[Gilbert Syndrome]]

Individuals with [[Rotor syndrome]] or [[Dubin-Johnson syndrome]] cannot get RiD of DiRect [bilirubin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Ln0wFg#Z07a8a4f4a850245bf742b6a98121b3e0).

Comparisons to others: 
not like cholestatic liver dz, which might lead to inc bilirubin serum levels
