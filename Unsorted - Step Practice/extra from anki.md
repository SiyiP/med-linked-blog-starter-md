wilsons disease
An autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of copper (due to ATP7B gene mutation) in which both impaired binding to its transporter protein (ceruloplasmin) and biliary excretion increase free serum copper, leading to accumulation in the body. Leads to copper deposits in the liver (early stages) and other organs (later stages), most importantly in the brain and cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings). Presentation involves hepatitis (or even cirrhosis), dementia, and parkinsonism.

hartnup disease
An autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by a defect transport protein required for the absorption of neutral amino acids (e.g., tryptophan) in the small intestine and proximal renal tubule. Since tryptophan is required for the synthesis of vitamin B3 (niacin), patients may become deficient and present with symptoms of pellagra (dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia) and cerebellar ataxia.

c-peptide
A peptide released during cleavage of insulin from proinsulin. Very low C-peptide levels indicate an absolute insulin deficiency and are seen in type 1 diabetes. Elevated C-peptide levels may indicate insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and are seen in type 2 diabetes. Exogenous insulin use does not elevate C-peptide levels.

hepcidin
An acute phase reactant released by the liver that decreases iron absorption by binding and degrading ferroportin on intestinal mucosal cells and macrophages, which inhibits iron transport. Levels are increased in patients with chronic inflammation, which causes anemia of chronic disease.

A drug that inhibits neprilysin (a metalloproteinase), which results in increased serum concentrations of natriuretic peptides, which induce vasodilation and natriuresis. Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor that acts through an active metabolite (LBQ657).- **Sacubitril** is a **neprilysin inhibitor**, found in association with **valsartan** → guideline therapy for **heart failure** (**neprilysin** metabolizes **ANP** and **BNP**)

subacute endocarditis - Form of endocarditis in which typically mild constitutional symptoms (low fever, mild fatigue) develop over a period of weeks to months. Most commonly caused by viridans streptococci species and generally affects individuals with pre-existing damage to the heart valves, structural heart defects, or the presence of prosthetic valves.

hypercapnia - An elevation of CO₂ > 45 mm Hg in arterial blood (normal pCO₂: 33–45 mm Hg). Can be acute (e.g., respiratory muscle paralysis, asthma, pneumonia) or chronic (e.g., COPD). Can be caused due to increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary embolism), decreased respiratory drive (e.g., sedative overdose, brainstem stroke), or decreased respiratory nerve/muscle function (e.g., poliomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome). 
Empyema is the accumulation of pus within a pre-existing cavity. A pleural empyema is the presence of pus in the pleural cavity, although the term is also used for any pleural effusion in which gram-positive bacteria are present. 

cor pulmonae - Altered structure (hypertrophy, dilation) or impaired functioning of the right ventricle caused by a primary disorder of the respiratory system (e.g., COPD, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary embolism). The primary respiratory disorder causes acute/chronic pulmonary hypertension, which in turn causes acute/chronic right heart failure.

achalasia - A condition characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation due to degeneration of inhibitory neurons within the esophageal wall. Symptoms include dysphagia to both solids and liquids, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, and weight loss.

intrinsic factor - A protein produced by the parietal cells of the stomach that facilitates vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum. Deficiency of intrinsic factor (e.g., due to atrophic gastritis, or following gastrectomy) leads to vitamin B12 deficiency.
**Sarcoidosis** is associated with **hypercalcemia** due to increased _1α-hydroxylase_ activity in **epithelioid histiocytes**
- 1 alpha hydroxylase - An enzyme that converts 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol (calcidiol), an inactive form of vitamin D, into 1,25-dihydroxy cholecalciferol (calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D. The enzyme is located predominantly in the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule and to a lesser extent in keratinocytes.

alkaptonuria - A rare, autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine metabolism caused by deficient activity of homogentisic acid dioxygenase. Clinical features include ochronosis, calcification of the heart valves, nephrolithiasis, arthritis, and urine that turns dark brown/black when left standing or alkalinized.

Dysgerminoma
Rare type of malignant ovarian germ cell tumor. Predominantly seen in young women (20–30 years of age). Female histological equivalent to male seminoma. - increased LDH
