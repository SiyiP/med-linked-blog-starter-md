SocHx - perhaps save the question about stressors+safety for the very end? to launch into that. 
Sexual - open questions, partners + practices , protection from STIs past hx from STIs, prevention of pregnancy 
- do the screening for the IPV during the social hx. 
- Assess for intimate partner violence with PVS, HITS, or HARK. ; 
- Further assess with Danger Assessment- 5 if need be. (NOTE: no written measures or assessment tools will be provided in the room
- provide counseling if warranted. - "There is help available. We could call a local shelter or national hotline to gather information on keeping you safe."
	- IPV is more likely to increase in severity than go away with time. This is a very huge issue in SC , people of every type of relationship experience this. 
Disclose about the child confidentiality - then ask: 
- has your child witnessed or been exposed to this violence?
- Has the perpetrator been violent to your child as well? 
"i dont wanna get anyone in trouble"
- "That's an understandable concern; I'm just asking to get a better idea of your safety. I want you to know that anything you share between you and the perpetrator is purely confidential, especially with any of the resources you might reach out to as well."
- if i may add something - **the only situation where i'd be required to share** as mandated reporters, we are obligated to report in cases where the child is involved, but you have the right to share as much or as little as possible. 
**share confidentiality as soon as possible!!! and don't bring it up again.**

resource counseling - might be viable to assess readiness to change similar to the substance use counseling? 
 
If yes to any of the PVS/HARK/HITS: 
Are you in immediate danger?  
Has the physical violence increased in frequency over the past year?  
Has your partner ever threatened to kill you?  
Has your partner ever used weapons such as a gun or knife?  
Has your partner ever strangled (choke) you?  
Is your partner excessively jealous?

"I am concerned about your safety” “You are not alone” Provide information “intimate partner violence is very common in all kinds of relationships” “Violence tends to continue and often becomes more  
frequent and severe.”  
*give them some time to respond every time you talk about the confidentiality + etc*
immediately follow up with the IPV screening as soon as they disclose 
about concerns with medical records - record what you discuss - but you can act and talk about access to the chart - patient's right to have confidentiality. 
- we report - gunshot wounds, strangulation., etc 

physical exam 
- lungs 4 places on back 
- cursory heart exam 4 places listen to bed at 30 degrees
- lungs 2 in front 
- auscultate abdomen bowel sounds
- palpate 1 handed 4 quadrants

Working with Med interpreter

working w/ interpreter + interpreting by phone 
Chapter 2 Interviewing, Communication, and Interpersonal Skills > Other Considerations in Communication and Interpersonal Skills
they are a cultural navigator, trained in both languages + cultures. 
clear, straightforward + short questions // don't condense or summarize, translate everything - what you tell the interpreter 
arrange seating to make the eye contact with patient + speak directly. 
having the interpreter if in person sit close to them or even behind you. 
ROS symptoms - have bilingual written questionnaires. - make sure they can read in their language first. or use speakerphone translators. 

MNEUMONIC: INTERORET 
|**I**|**Introductions:** Make sure to introduce all the individuals in the room. During the introduction, include information as to the roles individuals will play.|
|**N**|**Note Goals:** Note the goals of the interview. What is the diagnosis? What will the treatment entail? Will there be any follow-up?|
|**T**|**Transparency:** Let the patient know that everything said will be interpreted throughout the session.|
|**E**|**Ethics:** Use qualified interpreters (not family members or children) when conducting an interview. Qualified interpreters allow the patient to maintain autonomy and make informed decisions about his or her care.|
|**R**|**Respect Beliefs:** Patient with limited English proficiency (LEP) may have cultural beliefs that need to be taken into account as well. The interpreter may be able to serve as a cultural broker and help explain any cultural beliefs that may exist.|
|**P**|**Patient Focus:** The patient should remain the focus of the encounter. Providers should interact with the patient and not the interpreter. Make sure to ask and address any questions the patient may have before ending the encounter. If you don't have trained interpreters on staff, the patient may not be able to call in with questions.|
|**R**|**Retain Control:** It is vital as the provider that you remain in control of the interaction and not let the patient or the interpreter take over the conversation.|
|**E**|**Explain:** Use simple language and short sentences when working with an interpreter. This will ensure that comparable words can be found in the second language and that all the information can be conveyed clearly.|
|**T**|**Thanks:** Thank the interpreter and the patient for their time. On the chart, note that the patient needs an interpreter and who served as an interpreter this time.|

by telephone - they do not replace the need for on site med interpretation due to many nonverbal cues ): - 
do a face to face interpreter for : 
- serious dx or other bad news
- when pt is hard of hearing 
- family meetings/group discussions 
- interaction that require visuals
- complicated/personal med procedures/news
-   
    Appropriate Use of Medical Interpreters by Juckett and Unger [http://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/1001/p476.html](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/1001/p476.html)  
Children should never be used as interpreters except in emergencies
Statements should be short, and the discussion should be limited to three major points. In addition to acting as a conduit for the discussion, the interpreter may serve as a cultural liaison between the physician and patient.

when a bilingual clinician or a professional interpreter is not available, phone interpretation services or trained bilingual staff members are reasonable alternatives

multilingual staff members should be encouraged to receive additional training in interpretation technique; fluency alone does not make them effective interpreters
most feasible option - telephone service like ([http://languageline.com](http://languageline.com/)) or CyraCom Language Solutions ([http://www.cyracom.com](http://www.cyracom.com/))
soon after request, on-call trained interpreter is connected, clinics subscribe to service or pay per call 
- not inferiour to having a bilingual health professional 
- **if pt insists on having ad hoc or family as interpreter, this should ALWAYS be recorded on their chart!**
deaf/HOH are via video calls -not good to rely on any computerized services 

It is best to meet briefly with the interpreter before the patient encounter to make sure he or she is the appropriate choice, give some clinical background, build rapport, and set goals
The interviewer should speak in the first person (“I” statements), not the third person (e.g., “tell her,” “he said”), and speak directly to the patient, whereas the interpreter should function as an inconspicuous conduit for the conversation
![[med interpreter tips.png]]
- allow extra interview time, give bgd, build rapport + set goals
- document name of interpreter in progress note 
- seat the interpreter next to or slightly behind the pt
- ask one q at a time. allow time for interpreter to finish 
- insist on sentence by sentence, 
- **10 min breaks for every hour of interpretation**
- show me or teach back technique. 
- post-session discussion to get further details + make corrections. 
larification occurs when the interpreter interjects a brief explanation, often prefaced by the words “the interpreter would like to state….”

General Principles of Child Development 
    - Surveillance of Development 
we assess 5 critical domains of development: 
- physical (gross/fine motor)- mainly maniputlation of objs with hands and stuff; these are what parents are most famiiliar with 
- cognitive/problem solving - measure of child's ability to solve with intuition, perception, verbal/nonverb reasoning + info retention 
- lang/communication- also involves nonverbal modes of communication such as waving and head nodding
- social/emotional - ability to form/maintain relationships, responsiveness to others, formation of self-help skills in various activities of daily living, such as feeding, dressing, and toileting
**we use STANDARDIZED screening for these!**
development quotient is used **for each category of the 5; and we need to monitor over time bc it can change!**
Dev quotient = development age/chronologic age * 100 
- and 85+ = normal 
- 70-85 = possible delay, req follow up 
- lower than 70 = delayed. 
    - Key Components of Health Promotion 
Advise parents on upcoming developmental stages/strategies, capitalize on the examination to give age-appropriate guidance + on reading/conversing/etc for development. 
provide advice about expected maturational changes or how health behaviors can affect physical findings - such as with exercising can reduce bp + prevent obesity 
need to know vaccinations schedule 
oral health is huge 
anticipatory guidance covers genuinely so much. 
age specific screening at specific ages: 
	newborn genetic and metabolic screening
	newborn screening for hearing and critical congenital heart disease (oximetry), 
	(if appropriate) newborn screening for bilirubin, 
	growth parameters and developmental screening and behavioral/mental health screening at all ages
	blood pressure screening after age 3 years, 
	BMI screening after age 2 years
	vision and hearing screening at key ages.
	
    - Newborns and Infants, Preschool and School-Aged Children 
        - Health History: General Approach
    newborn visit is new = engage with the family, learn about the newborn's family and environment, understand key aspects of the pregnancy, bond with the family, and observe the family's interactions with the newborn
    - get info on: qs/concerns by parents, prenatal hx, labor, delivery, neonatal course prior to visit like health of mom, plans for feeding, neonatal hx inclusive of cultural beliefs, family hx, soc hx, parents observation of behavior, feeding/nutrition, sleeping, stooling, urination, safety, anticipatory guidance abt care: illness prev, dressing, protection, care of their body, and upcoming visits/when to call 
    
        - Surveillance of Development - neurologic dev central to peripheral , they control head first growth is huge during infancy. 

![[Dev Milestones Birth - 12 mon.png]]
        - Physical Examination: General Approach 
First exam is performed immediately post-delivery. Listen to the anterior thorax with your stethoscope, palpate the abdomen, and inspect the head, face, oral cavity, extremities, genitalia, and perineum.
subsequent physicals at regular intervals -  **If possible, do the physical examination in front of the parents so that they can interact with you and ask questions**
- swaddle + undress, dim lights and rock it, demonstrate calming maneuvers, observe feeding + teach parents about the transitions as it wakes up 
ex of newborn behavior - habituation, attach, state regulation, perception of faces etc 

infants - approach w toy, speak softly , make sure they're well fed, ask about their strengths. 
**Close observation of an awake infant sitting on the parent's lap can reveal potential abnormalities of tone, conditions with abnormal skin color, jaundice or cyanosis, jitteriness, or respiratory problems.**
We do an [[APGAR Score Algo.png]] score for the infants + newborns 
gestational age is determined by ballard scoring to estimate it to within 2 weeks 

        - Health Promotion and Counseling: Evidence and Recommendations 
 AAP and the group Bright Futures[19] recommend health supervision visits for infants below 1 year of age at the following ages: at birth, at 3 to 5 days, by 1 month, and at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months
 Then after that we would go annual 
 Discussions - address concerns/questions, provide advice, obtain soc hx , assess dev, nutrition, sleep, elim, safety, oral health, fam relationships, stressors, parenting beliefs, comm factors. 
 - Use a standardized developmental instrument to measure milestones
for screening we need to screen vision/hearing + social risk factors
immunization schedule AAP / CDC 
**Anticipatory guidance**
injury + illness prev
nutrition
oral health 
parent/infant interaction - promoting development 
family relationships - time for self, babysitters 
community interaction - childcare/resources 

---
school-aged children health hx - get needs nad pov of both the kid + caregivers. 
Call the parents as Mr or Ms Smith ... and ask who they brought here. 
- who else do you live with? 
- eye contact on their level, playful engagement, clothes, toys, favorite book/tv show or their adult companion 
	- spend some time in the beginning to calm and connect with them 
simple open ended questions - OLDCCAAARTSPIES
"are you sick? ...tell me about it"
“Your mom tells me that you get stomachaches. Tell me about them.”
“Show me where you get the pain. What does it feel like?” 
“What helps make it go away? What makes it worse?”
“What do you think causes it?”
get other povs if there's family members not present but have concerns: _“If Suzie's father were here today, what questions or concerns would he have?” “Have you, Mrs. Jones, discussed this with your mother or anyone else?” “What does she think?”_

 _“Mr. Chang, you are doing such a wonderful job with Brian. Being a parent takes so much work and Brian's behavior here today clearly shows your efforts. We might have some suggestions for you at the end of the visit.”_ Or to the child, _“Brian you are so lucky to have such a wonderful dad.”_
As with adults, the chief complaint may not relate to the real reason the parent has brought the child to see you. 
_“Do you have any other concerns about Randy?”_
Surveillance of Dev: Middle childhood, 5-10 yrs 
physical - enhanced strength + coordination+ competnce in various tasks / activities. need screening, assessing parental problems 
- Anticipatory guidance: safety, exercise, nutrition, sleep|
cog - concrete operational focus on the present, emphasis on short term consequences
- achievement of knowledge is here, screening for skills + school performanc 
social - achieving good fit for the family, friends schoo, self esteem, evolving identity . assessment, support, advice about interactions and peer relationships. support + emphasis on strengths, understanding etc. 
for physical exam, make sure to give gown and leave underwear in place. leave the room while they change w parental help. 
- _Parents of children younger than 11 years should stay with them. Adhere to your setting's chaperone policy._
- **Examine painful areas last and forewarn children about areas you are going to examine.** If a child resists part of the examination, you can return to it at the end.

- Review the Infancy, Early Childhood, and Middle Childhood “tip sheets” for anticipatory guidance here: [http://www.brightfutures.org/TipSheets/index.html](http://www.brightfutures.org/TipSheets/index.html). These do not need to be discussed in class. 
We can get you a family tip sheet for more information on day-to-day experiences. 
Between the ages of 4-6 before they enter school they should get 
- DTap, IPV polio , measles, mumps , rubella MMR, and Hep A in some areas. 
- regular checkups at 5,6,8,10 
social development recs - how they grow in confidence, independence, etc. they'll get ideas about personal responsibility and morals. 
- spend time together, encourage them to do some chores for sense of responsibility, and be clear about behaviors that are and aren't okay. 
- encourage family time, and make sure your children can be encouraged to solve their own arguments. 
- help them become aware of other people's lives, strengths, problems and needs. 
we can discuss how they express anger and conflict resolution, signs of low self esteem or depression, and how they're doing in school. 
- near this age, we can anticipate some changes to happen in puberty, such as potentially menstruation in girls and breast development. 
- this is the time where their thinking ability shifts from being self-centered to being about to think about others, and eventually understand cause and effect. 
- they'll get groing independence, sense of right or wrong, and understanding of one's role in the world 

eating - nutritious meals w/ grains, fruits, vegetables, chicken/fish/lean meats and l**ow fat dair**y 
encourage modeling good healthy eating habits and start off with good breakfast 
keep nutritious snacks in the house and limit ones high in fat or sugar. 
discuss possible food allergies + weight gain 

oral health - losing much of their baby teeth and permanent ones grow in place. We should be brushing 2x a day with a pea size of fluoridated toothpaste and need a dentist every 6 months. 
i think a convo about tobacco and smoking is also helpful, and note that it could cause some oral diseases, cancers, and other conditions 
there are ways to protec ttheir teeth like mouthguards as well 
- discussion - thumb sucking, when and how to floss, whether we need fluoride supplements, what to do if the kid hurts his mouth or breaks tooth, if they should get sealants or braces. with **dentist** 

physical activity - make it fun, encourage many differnet activities including everyday tasks like raking leaves, washign the car, or any other family volunteer events. 
- limit screens to an hour, and outside the bedroom 
- be a role model. 
dicuss - difficulties ith any activities, right amount for your child or concerns w special needs 

EDU - 
- prep ur kid, tour the school, meet your teachers + stay in touch with them. 
- attend school related things if possible and encourage participation. 
- what does she tell you about school? 
- difficulties might be related to vision, hearing or other health conditions. we can talk about special needs nad how we can support them in getting accomodations 
sexual dev - as they near ages 8-10 prepare them for natural experiences of puberty and teach them the correct words. encourage them to ask questions and I'd reommend getting them some books with the librarian's help. discuss what he's learning in other forms of sex education and share your values and attitudes about it 

safety discussion - setting clear rules about safe behavior as they get older
- make sure there's a safe route to or from school 
- teach to cross the street safely, and biking rules + helmet whenever + protective gear + swimming + limit suntime or use sunscreen 
- no front seat until age 13 
- use a car safety seat until he can sit upright against the back seat and bend his knees over the edge. make sure the seat belts have both shoulder + lap straps 
- remove guns from home or keep them unloaded/locked + install smoke alarms
- lock meds, cleaners etc. 
know the route to the emergency room + closest ones, especially covered by insurance. you can ask for financial assistance. 
get the poison control center near the phone number 
get first aid + child cpr course. 
do safety check on your home
- during the chckup we can tlak more abt dealing w emergencies, injuries, poisonings, reaching us after office hrs + community safety programs

*Intimate Partner Violence Screening
--- 
-> Health promotion + counseling: Evidence/Recs
IPV screening*
1/5 women experience some abuse during pregnancy -> delayed prenatal care, low birth weight, death of mom + fetus. 
ACOG - universal screening of all women for IPV 
“Because violence is so common in many women's lives and because there is help available for women being abused, I now ask every patient about domestic violence.”
screening questions - 
-  “Within the past year—or since you have been pregnant—have you been hit, slapped, kicked, or otherwise physically hurt by someone?”
- “Are you in a relationship with a person who threatens or physically hurts you?”
- “Has anyone forced you to have sexual activities that made you feel uncomfortable?”
look into nonverbal clues of abuse: freq last min appt changes, unusual behavior, partners who refuse to leave the pt, etc. 
- "whats the best way for me to help you? you can have limits on what you share; just know that as a mandated reporter, I would have to report any harmful behaviors **if there are children involved**" - i trust you know your current situation the most and know how to be the most safe you can. 
- we have some resources like updated local referrals, and **we'd like to plan any future appointments at more frequent intervals too.**
may i conduct a physical exam and best document all your ijuries on a body diagram? 

uptodate _Intimate Partner Violence: Diagnosis and Screening_
no gold standard here - but the 39 item revised conflict tactics scale - most widely used ref for IPV ... but they're too lengthy 
theres some short surveys for practicioners. 
- "Violence can be a problem in many people's lives, so I now ask every patient about trauma or abuse they may have experienced in a relationship."
short surveys - one listed in the OSCE: PVS partner violence scale
• Have you been hit, kicked, punched, or otherwise hurt by someone within the past year? If so, by whom? 
• Do you feel safe in your current relationship?
• Is there a partner from a previous relationship who is making you feel unsafe now?

HARK - one point for every yes
**H**umiliation – Humiliated or emotionally abused in other ways by your partner or your ex-partner?
-**A**fraid – Afraid of your partner or ex-partner?
-**R**ape – Raped or forced to have any kind of sexual activity by your partner or ex-partner?
-**K**ick – Kicked, hit, slapped or otherwise physically hurt by your partner or ex-partner?

HITS - Each HITS question is scored on a five-point scale (never, rarely, sometimes, fairly often, and frequently, with a score >10 indicating likely victimization).
•How often does your partner:
-**H**urt you physically?
-**I**nsult you or talk down to you?
-**T**hreaten you with harm?
-**S**cream or curse at you?

in general, pts reveal IPV when questionnaires are self administered like computer screening or form disclosure. 
times to administer it 
- pregnancy, initial primary care + ob/gyn visits. and ER visits on adminssion too
