good review for this - check the TBL in the summary section. 

CASE 1: 
resp distress - 1 yo, tachypneic 
no tonsils. 
right lower lobe pneumonia 
1 wk later - productive cough, low grade fevers, spread pneumonia
recurrent ear infections 
note - we have a pedigree 
==Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of Infancy==.Â This condition is a type of hypogammaglobulinemia, meaning low levels of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood, which are part of the immune system.

why was this kid healthy for the first 6 mon of life then reduced? - mom's antibodies, IgG from transplacental 
- what happens post-6 months? - the half life of these antibodies wane. 
- what immunology labs to order? - IgM, IgE, IgA. we can test b cell lvls too , expect them to be not there. 
- pathologic immune defect associated w/ this condition - BTK
- treatment option - bandaid of pooled plasma's Immunoglobulins 

XLA - 6-12 mos, recurrent sinopulm infections, small/no tonsils/lymph node, chronic giardia diarrhea, entrovirus meningoencephalitis 

case 2 
full term baby - not breastfeeding
seizure like, blue skin 
testing for me
thoughts on ordering panels - 
seizure reasons -
- glucose check (on CMP)
- calcium (on CMP)
enlarged <3, no thymic shadow
what we're worried about - 
1 day old baby w/ a hx of seizure like activity, bluish color,  poor feeding, big heart, and no thymus 
- 22q11.2 , digeorge - microdeletion. - most common immune problem is T cell, most common infection? - 
- Thymic defects = mild - mod t cell lymphopenia, if they dont have a thymus at all, **we have SCID**
most common : ear infections (craniofacial abnormalities too), recurrent viral infections. 
don't get any live attenuated vaccines for this! 
- MMRV 
- DTap, HiB conj, hep b, polio + prevnar 20 - are all inactivated 
treatment - prophylactic antibiotics, bone marrow transplant, thymic transplant.  

stem cell treatments - usually for combined defects

case 3 
premature, c section, resp distress, apneaof prematurity + feeding difficulties, difficulty to thrive and very small. x-linked. 
formula feeding, chronic nasal congestion, viral uris + allergies maybe? 
intermittent diarrhea 
acute resp distress + fever
2 diff resp viruses. +much pneumonia 
clogged tear duct purulent eye discharge
notably - WBC 6.96, 59% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes
- normal WBC - "normal for his age, but expected for infection?"
- neutrophils in a kid with pneumonia - is kinda normal?? 
concern - function deficiency in b cells? SCID? 
3 antibx , worsening pneumonia - which persisted in spite of antibiotics bc he wasn't able to bc our cells arent poewred up 
- he has SCID. 
- get labs and studies - 
- flow cytometry - are nk, t and b cells normal? 
- CBC - are for NICUs, "poor mans flow cytometry, this is an absolute lymphocyte count, nice and ez but not something that we can rely on"
- antibodies also helpful but more for b cell stuff
showed t cell profoundly low! normal B cells, and NK cells low. 
- always in scid you have low t cells. 
immunoglobulins decreased 
types of infections with SCID
- viral, bacterial, fungal (due to low t cells too); mainly opportunistic - PJP, candida, MAI, vaccine associated dz, CMV. 
- what we can do for the baby - stem cells , and before that prophalactics. 
	- irradiated, leukopoor CMV negative blood products - **bc CMV makes IL-10?** no risk of getting anything from the blood 
persisten eczema like rash, thrush, diaper rash. 

TREC screening - new born screening - t cell receptor excision circle - now screened for in 50 states - tell them if they need a bone marrow transplant before day 100 
for newborn scid identification = so that they can live past year 1 

case 4: 
15 yo boy in hs , shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, patchy cotton ball densities in both lungs. 
can be something fungal? 
- so we would think of imaging CXR 
worried about - phagocytic defect / cellular one 
- CBC
- check innate issue - check complements with CH50 or something; 
	- other things - you can check for NADPH oxidase with theDPH + color 
	- LAD - check for flow cytometry cells 
	- we ultimately get a DHR assay 
- basically no functional bursting activity - CYBB mutation - no NADPH oxidase, so this is chronic granulomatous Disease. 
and the older NBT - if it's normal, we ill see blue = reactive superoxide. rapid, but technician dependen,t and we have a lot f false negatives in carriers ): 
in general - these are phagocytic disorders = know 
- CGD - look out for cat-poz orgaisms. 
- LAD 
mom with lupus, healthy dad, 1 healthy bro+1 perirectal abscess brother, healthy sisters. 
- should anyone under go immune eavl? _ should do a DHR - we can tell carriers in it too! 
- best - test mom, brothers AND BOTH sisters!!! family planning + sisters can be a carrier 
note - mom with lupus can be a carrier. 
treatment for CGD - just phagocytic defects -  have some prophalactic antibiotics + antifungals + iFN - gamma, curative therapy might be - **stem cell transplants.** 
note - these kids don't present normal with infections - **no robust inflammatory responses, might present with abscess + lethargic. aggressively control infections.**
