=="adolescence - don't focus on it too much but have an idea of age"==
- ==early = 10-13, middle adolescence 14-16, and late is 17-21.== 
- extensive growth. and development, rapid growth, puberty, cognitive , sexual maturity , simultaneously but asynchronously. 

==10-13 early== 
- ==preocupied with changing body== 
- ==able to weigh view points== 
- ==moral - begin to perceive right + wrong== 
- ==academic - algebra ; concrete== 
- ==social - same sex peers== 
- ==just developing sexual interests==

==14-16 -== 
- ==more accepting of body ; for the girls, development starts slowing down== 
- ==strained with parents==
- ==personal codes of ethics==
- ==experiment with specific peer groups, cliques== 
- ==cognitive - abstract thinking, future orientation== 
- ==dating + same sex experimentation might be normal . very common doens't mean a label.== 

==17-21 - late adolescence==
- ==less stable body image , physical changes slow==
- ==less self centered , delayed gratification== 
- ==moral - more focus on justice, patriotism, history ; future-oriented, more thinking of the future.== 
- ==future oriented, focus on long term plans.== 
- ==intimate relationships > peer relationships.== 

priorities for visit - good more time for teens . 
- physical growth + dev, social + adademic competence, emotional well being, risk reduction, violence and injury prevention 

--
introduce urself directly to pt first then the caregiver 
explain the format of visit 
- interview as a group 
- interview adolescent individually - 
- physical exam. 

same format - hpi - well check or problem focused
- well check- diet, elim, sleep habits, shool, activities, behavior 

confidential hx 
- screen for risk taking behaviors + provide individual counseling 
- statement - patient confidentiality - allows physician to maintain this unless there's risk of harm to pt or others - i cant' tell t any family members 
- ==**mature minor - state laws, at 16 - that allow pt consent for care without parental consent.**== 
	- ==younger ages are allowed as deemed necessary by the provider - like if they're 14, having sex, they'll screen for STIs and then test for poz, we can treat them and then don't have to tell parents==
	- 14 yo having sex, they do screen for STI, and test for chlamidia. 
	- they need treatment, and beg for us to not tell their parents. 
	- **at 14... we should treat them, and we won't tell the parents bc we don't need parental consent.** 
==birth control - if 14 and starting BC, we need to tell parents. "let me talk to your parents abt this. if not about sex, we can find another reason, like heavy periods or something"==
if they're 16, no consent needed. 14 yo, HPV vaccines, if parents decline u just have to go along ); 
- but at 16 yes.

exam findings 
- ==tanner staging - **2 things on step one - but keep this in mind key findings** - start this convo at age 7== 
	- grade puberty on scale of 1-5 (1 is nothing)
	- we have beads that measure testicular volume (vol 4 = early puberty) - first thing noticed is the balls are slightly bigger. 
	- female - stage breasts + pubic hair. 
	- ==**stage 4 = - nipple + areola will project to make a 2nd mound on the test - clinically easy to identify . **==
	- ==pubic hair growth - **stage 3 - darker coarser + more CURLED hair. NO hair on thigh areas.** same for males.== 
additional screening
- ==screen - htn annually , obesity + ED, vision, hearing, anemia, TB, dyslipidemia== 
- ==htn - bp - male/female, height and age gives you a percentile. weight is **not a part of the formula**==
- ==STIs if sexually active. some do point of care hiv blood draw etc.== 
- ==anemia in mensturating females - end of puberty in them.== 
- ==pregnancy== 
- ==substance abuse/alc==

normal v abnormal behaviors. 
==impairment distinguishes abnormal behavior- how does behavior affect ability to accomplish tasks + avoid injury/other legal/med/social consequences== 
prefrontal cortex - develops in mid 20s - self regulation, thinking before actin,g planning + judgement 

==3 leading causes of adolescent morbidity + mortailty== 
- ==intentional injuries==
- ==unintentional injuries like accidents==
- ==unintene pregnancy, STIs==
- alc and drug use contribute to many of these. 
normal - experimentation with alc/drugs, with sex, and mood fluctuations, passive / transient thoughts of self harm 
abnormal - use of alc/drugs that result in impairment, early initiation of intercourse , unprotected, multiple sex partners, sex under the influence. depressive mood 2 wks + !! and persistent self harm cognitions or behavior/plan 
- impairment we see dropping things, like dropping grades, etc. 

avoid taking notes
be attentive, express empathy
establish confidentiality early like at 12 . every year we have this opportunity , let me knw if you want to meet more often 
ask sensitive / difficult questions in third q - like do your friend vape?
