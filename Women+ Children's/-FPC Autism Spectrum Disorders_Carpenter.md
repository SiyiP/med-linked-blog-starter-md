we value the autistic adults
==2 clusters - social communication deficits + restricted repetitive behaviors== 
==social comm skills==
- ==social emotional reciprocity - give and take of social interaction , convo structures + responses== 
- ==nonverbal comm - poor use of facial expressions etc== 
- ==social relationships - prefers to be alone , no understanding of social rules, center on shared interests only== 

 autismnavigator.com video glossary - great resource w typical v atypical development for parents. 

 ==restricted repetitive behaviors - 2 of 4 must be present==
 - ==repetitive behavior like speech, use of obj==
 - ==routines/rituals==
 - ==intense interests==
 - ==sensory differences==  
ASD. - some children fall on the border.
some get dx as adults. inappropriate diagnoses - particularly women with many mental health dx. 
- many people have some forms of autism, but doesn't mean we have to get an offficial dx

pathways to asd - doesn't change the diagnoses. many pathways. 
- genetic 65-91% heritability ; recommend genetic testing in dx ppl but not huge. 
- genetic changes in 12%, like with angelman, fragile x etc
- inherited or de novo, multiple changes might compound
- pre/perinatal RF
- early neglect? not sure of all the factors. 
- we don't worry about which pathway - the treatment and dx is still the same

==Why is it increased? - expanded criteria, improved detection, decreased stigma, survival of premature infants, later marriages/older dads, parent/provider awareness of social milestones. 2 ppl with mild autism characteristics might find each other...==

==ASD in toddlers - symptoms emerge between 1-2 years.== 
- 17 mon - when there's first concern reported in dev/behavior 
- very few symptoms before 12 mos. 12-24 mos - huge thing 

==dx - earliest at 15 mos==
- ==early dx fairly stable, most will meet criteria at 36 mos.== 
- up to 10% might not meet criteria later in childhood. 
- ==lack of dx not stable . ppl who don't meet criteria @ 2,3 do meet criteria later.==
- ==waxing and waning of symptoms== 

screening for ASD - 
general dev screening 
9,18, 30 
==autism specific screening. - 18 + 24 mos - M-CHAT-R/F - more accurate at 24 mos + misses some kids who do have it + many false positives.== 
- ==free form. 20 y/n questions complete by parent.s== 
- ==<3 dont' need any follow up, but score 3-7 need followup, but 8+ = early intrvention referral== 
- 18 mos, 24 mos 
broad screening -> early dx -> early intervention = best outcomes 
 - screening decreases age of dx which is good. 
 - autism specific screeners are good 
 
==after a high risk screen they can totally just refer to early intervention / early childhood edu services.== 
- ASD dx - developmental hx most important to collect. 
==Autism dx observation schedule - ADOS-2==
- ==structured 40-60 min strctured to elicit comm/social skills==
- ==for younger kids - looking at joint attention, free play, novel toys, social routines==
- ==older kids - convos, books, interview==

==ADOS-2 scoring== 
- ==language  , social, play/immagination, restricted interests/stereotyped behaviors==
