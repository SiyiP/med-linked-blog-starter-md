recall - 
boudnaries 
Medial = sternocostal junction 
 Lateral = mid-axillary line
 Inferior = level of sixth rib at midclavicular line, inframammary fold

**tail of spence -** axillary tail of breast extending up to the armput + shoulder
glandular tissue = hormonally sensitive , like during menstruation 
fibrous connective tissue - cooper ligaments / suspensory ligaments
adipose tissue 
breast anatomy - divided into 4 quadrants to facilitate clinical finding description ... + findings can be described in reference to a clock in clinicals. 
- describe where you felt it! ![[breast clock + quadrants.png]]
- reminder that most lymph drainage to axillary nodes; and remainder to the clavicular nodes 
mostly done for screening - clinical bresat exam
- or a problem visit with smoeone with concern 
- in the last 5-10 yrs, gotten controversial - shoould we even be screening? - addition of clinical breast exam can detect 2-6% more than mammography alone, but like 55 false positives to get 1 true poz! - causes lots of anxiety in patients. 
they usually offer it to the patients. but let them know that some would skip it and do shared decision making. 
get a history 
- breast complaint - lump/pain, nipple discharge skin changes
- always ask prior imaging, biopsies, surgeries etc. 
risk assessment 2 models- very helpful for poz fam hx but less than 40 yo 
Gail model - provides personal 5 yr risk and lifetime risk of breast cancer - recommendations for lifetime screening. getting mri imaging every so often etc. some imaging every 6 mon 
Age 
• Race 
• Age at menarche 
• Age at first delivery 
• Prior biopsy? 
• Family h/o breast cancer (1st degree relatives)

Tyrer-Cuzick Model adds 
• BMI 
• Menopausal status 
• Hormone therapy use 
• Ashkenazi inheritance 
• Extended family history
10 year and lifetime risk;; if 20+% lifetime risk, high risk and more imaging. 

use chaperone, drape / cover areas of body not being examined. inspection + palpation, seated + supine 
- ask first "how do breast exams go for you? how can I make this more comfortable for you?"
- verbalize - im looking for skin changes, nipples to see any cracks/drainage. 
- textbook - start with them seated then bring them flat for palpation. 
- but clinical rotations - ppl have a different way! 
==visual inspection==
- ==seated position, lower + open drape to inspect both simultaneously== 
- ==masses too deep to feel can cause changes in contours of breast.== 
- ==hands at side, then raised hands (reveals dimpling) , then hands on hips (will stretch lateral tissue- dimpling/retraction in skin)==
- ==leaning forward last motion - optional.== 
- ==asymmetry is very normal. new skin changes - lok into history - thickening, prominent pores, redness.== 
- ==sudden nipple inversion - recall this is cancerous potentially .==
	- nipple retracition - acute + abnormal. 
	- ==paget disease - rash/ulceration of nipple, indicates underlying ductal carcinoma. looks kinda like eczema around the nipple== 
contour - look for masses, dimpling/retraction with lift up, and flattening. 
- ask pt - is this a new thing? compare breasts too. 

![[lymph drainage breast.png]]

==best palpate lymphatics - just palpate **lateral + supraclavicular ones**==
- ==support their arms, try to keep breasts covered, examine all 4 sides of axilla in a "diamond"==
- ==deep in apex of axilla, hand straight up, deep into underarm==
- proceeding down chest wall, lift tissue, medially palpate in border of pectoral muscle
- then subscalpular nodes + then sweep back up 
- then supraclavicular + infraclavicular, just above the clavicle a bit
==supine breast palpation - put arm up and over the head==
- cover non palpated breast
- ==palpating technique - pads 2,3,4th flexed fingers. lawnmower go up and down.== 
	- small circles light then medium then deep pressure. - don't wanna miss anything 
	- going form medial to lateral border to mid axillsry line 
	- lawnmower in best validated technicque 
==know her density and the consistency of tissue - if too dense, we can't feel it - might warrant sooner screening==
tenderness? - palpate that area - is it the breast or the pec/intercostal muscles? 
nodules - note - Location  Size  Shape  Consistency  Well circumscribed  Mobility

nipple palppation 
- ==gently place thumb/index finger on medial + lateral sides of nipple or sandwich nipple between fingertips of both hands - good if there's no discharge complaint==
- complaint of discharge - more thorough, will radially palpate around the nipple 
- note any change in elasticity / discharge. 

==many abnormal findings - skin findings.== 
- ==dimpling, edema (lymphatic blockade, mass deep inside blocking lymph draining, peau d'orange), pagets dz. , nipple retraction==

there's like 3 algorithms for complaints:

==breast mass - super common - order diagnostic mammogram not screening one.== 
- ==<30, targeted ultasound... we see something that's possibly benign. = 6 month follow up ultrasound.== 
	- ==reason why we do ultrasound not mammogram - young ppl have dense breast tissue== 
- sus finding - mammogram, then img guided core needle biopsy 

- ==30+ -> diagnostic mammogram + ultrasound.... then if it's prob a benign , we see 6 month followup imaging .== 
- ==if suspicious finding, we do image guided core needle biopsy for both== 
--
breast pain - 
focal pain = localized - can be hormonal, trauma, musculoskeletal 
- ==cyclical focal pain - no non-routine imagine if clinical breast exam normal ; coming with other PMS symptoms?== 
- ==noncyclical focal pain - age under 30, ultrasound, and over 30 - diagnostic mammogram w/ ultrasound== 
diffuse pain - in whole breast or both - can be hormoneal too, heaviness of larger breasts (bad bra), pregnancy 
- under 40, no imaging if CBE normal 0
- 40+ - mammogram 
--
==nipple discharge- unilateral bloody discharge very abnormal , intraductal papilloma; bilateral white discharge can be physiologic or prolactinoma.  or breast milk== 
- ==physiologic - non spontaneous bilateral, white yellow or green - no imaging needed==
- pathologic- spontaneous , without palpating it, unilateral, bloody or serous
	- under 30 = get retroareolar ultrasound
	- if negative **do mRI or ductography** 
	- lesion seen - get image guided core biopsy 
	- 30 + = get diagnostic mammogram ; negative - do mRI or ductography 
	- lesion seen - get image guided core biopsy 
--
if new nipple inversion - we do dx mammogram + ultrasound 
if normal - **please do breast MRI +/- excisional biopsy if we find something bc malignancy is super high**
paget's dz - peau de orange - if dx mammogram + ultrasound, and if normal, still do breast MRI + excisional biospy . 
==self-breast exam monthly - not required. but self awareness is recommended. notify if there's new lump, nipple discharge, redness or pain.== 
most common most dangerous - they like to ask about broad differentials.

P: 1 term, 
- bleeding
- how far apart?
- how long they been having them? 
- water? 
- braxon hicks contractions
