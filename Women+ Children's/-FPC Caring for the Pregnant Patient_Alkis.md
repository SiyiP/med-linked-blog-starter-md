anticipatory guidance, comprehensive antepartum care program - coordinated approach to care +psychosocial support
we talk about all the histories, including nutritional, psychosocial, cultural , edu needs for the family, continual risk assessments. 
high yield slide ==![[prenatal visit info freq.png]]==
we look at the baby and the mom
==before the 3rd trimester which is like about 28 weeks pts come once  a month== 
==then it's every 2 weeks== 
==then it's basically every week for the last month.== 

==first prenatal visits - pregnancy dating // earlier the pregnancy the more accurate==
==last menstrual period calculation only useful if they got regular cycles of 28 days.== 
- ==EDD - estimated date of delivery - best dating is an accurate last menstrual period with a first trimester ultrasound.== 
can be off by 2 wks - 1 month as we get more and more later. 
==first thing - blood counts, antibody screenings, STIs, HIv, immunity to stufff, etc==
in the middle - we look at genetic conditions like tay sachs etc. 

pregnancy dating EDD / EDC are the same thing 
between 1st and 2nd trimester = 14 weeks become 2nd, 28 weeks become 3rd. 
don't have to know in detail of the gestational age ranges etc. like when do we go by ultrasound measurements vs the other stuff - we use a certain table. 

genetic testing - focused on birth defects, intellectual disability since birth, metabolism errors, known genetic dz. 
- we have genetic counselers here for aneuploidy screening, carriers, pedigree making. 
like specific ethnic panels too. 

==carrier screening - basic carrier stuff for EVERYONE==
- ==hemoglobinopathy like thalassemias, sickle cells, CF, spinal muscular atrophy== 
==special populations - like family hx of fragile x or intellectual disability we screen. also premature ovarian failure==
==ashkenazi jewish - canavan dz, CF, dysautonomia, tay sachs==

==aneuploidy - cell-free fetal DNA  - noninvasive, this is what we do now called NIPS/NIPT==
- ==most commonly checking aneuploidy for placental SNPs in maternal circulation.== 
- ==**indiates at risk, not diagnostic bc it's just a screen.**==
- basically we refer them to counseling but diagnosticallly not tested just yet. 
==amniostesis - amniotic fluid tap to get an actual diagnostic test.== 

healthcare disparities - huge focus - in south carolina 
- maternal mortality - many pregnancy related deaths + morbidities for specific groups. 
- in SC - the deaths are due to cardiomyopathy, mental health conditions, hemorrhage, infections
- ==changed to leading cause now for maternal mortality is - **maternal mental illness and substance use**==
- every year, increase healthcare access - hard for patients ... some ideas for hospitals to be prepped with hemorrhage bundles 
- most complications for the postpartum period to catch stuf early 

==ACOG strategy - QI focus initiative, see postpartum 1-3 wks instead of 6 wks. , mental health resources and establishment of PCP for up to a year postpartum.==
