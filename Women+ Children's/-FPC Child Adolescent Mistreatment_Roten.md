==CAPTA - passed id min set of acts + behaviors **on a state level** to define child abuse== 
- =="Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation” OR • "An act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm."==
- can be an act or something they fail to do. child <18. 
==abuse/neglect - done or not done by parent, caregiver, or individual in a custodial role (i.e. babysitter, coach, teacher) - **note - it doesn't matter the intent**==
==*assault* -  refers to actions performed by non-caregivers==

maltreatment classification 
- physical - Caregiver or responsible adult inflicts physical injury/lasting tissue damage upon a child by other than accidental means; to a child or a vulnerable person 
	- ==if you hit them to punish but don't mean to cause injury - could still be considered physical abuse.== 
==physical, sexual, . attempt @ sexual contact is also seen as sexual abuse== 
physical neglect as lack of supervision or a neglect/failure to provide
==emotional maltreatment - persistent or extremely thwarts a child's basic emotional needs.== 

ideally - we want to preserve the family. but if not, ther's a time limit, and making sure we don't over or under prescribe meds, and thinking about a permenant thing we can do as a plan. 

sequelae - 
- developmental impairment. where are they when the insult occurs. 
- mental health symptoms / dx
- impaired academically 
- social difficulty 
- PTSD 
- ==physical consequences - stress response, cortisol + neuroanatomy - **decreased hippocampal size in adults suffering from abuse**==
==prevention - stress like poverty): , strengthen families==

2. ==Strengthening family relationships== 
3. ==Understanding the impact of trauma on the child  - what is bothering the kid the most? completely individual based on the kid.== 
4. ==Well-being of child (treatment of psychiatric symptoms, functional impairment); disrupted sleep + nightmares. make sure they're not to blame/not responsible for the trauma==

we are all mandated reporters!!!
- CPS - national name; but we have our own org - 
- ==https://dss.sc.gov - we need to call for abuse and explain it - for suspected case etc. - now we have a central intake system, one phone number for everyone in SC.== 
- when to report- if we believe the physical/mental health has been adversely affected
	- ==we don't need to have conclusive proof. we don't ave to be certain - **reasonable suspicion**==
	- ==**realistically, we can always report to law enforcement. never wrong to; dss would ideally cross report w/ law enforcement too when you reach out.**==
	- ==also it's helpful to notify everybody in the household like the parental figures beforehand.== 
	- ==we must be there to report - cannot delegate it to any assistant or something== 
	- ==will have to report for other people's kids too== 
	==-kid doesn't have to be your patient. if you see a parent as a patient, you can still report.== 

==you will call law enforcement **if the perpetrator isn't the kid's guardian or caregiver at all!**==
good thing to ask in residency - ask how they personally go about reporting abuse. 
- report ASAP upon disclosure
- be prepared to provide: 
	- Name / birthdate of child •
	- Name / contact (phone, address) of parents •
	- If there are other children in the home • 
	- Where the child goes to school • 
	- Reasons for concern
- don't have to tell them everything but this can be helpful.
potential outcomes - accepted for investigation or case referred to voluntary preventative services. (when they contact the family to offer in home services etc)
ACEs - not the same as child maltreatment, but child maltreatment falls within this 
- divorce, mental illness of parents , incarceration of parent, etc. 

ACE scale - **most adults experience at least one ACE. 4+ ACEs = more high risk of pysch + medical morbidity + mortality!**
