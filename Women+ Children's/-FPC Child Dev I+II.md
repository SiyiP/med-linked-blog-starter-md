movement/physical dev: gross+fine motor - **crawling isn't a milestone, if they skip crawling its not an issue**
language/com
soc/emo
cognitive 
**newer: guidelines expect 75% or more children expected to exhibit these listed milestones.** 

how to monitor? 
surveillance - Continuous process recommended at every well check; caregivers obs changes **over time**
screening - Done in pediatrics! Formal screening at **9 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30 months** with **validated tools**
- **Autism specific screening at 18 and 24 months**
evaluation - trained **specialist takes in-depth look** ; with additional validated tools 

great resource for parents: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/index.html keep track of milestones

![[Shapes by Age Cheat Sheet.png]]

**red flag** $ all of these are frequently tested 
- **milestone regression = never normal**
- **referral - no walking by 18 mon** 
- **fail to dev 3 real words by 18 mon** 
- **tone abnormalities** 
threats to dev - ACEs/adverse childhood experiences, chronic dz, SDOH = food insecurity, poverty, insecure/inappropriate housing. 

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development 
• Sensorimotor (~Birth – 2 years) 
	egocentric - cannot perceive world from others - **cognitive goal: obj permanence!**
• Preoperational Stage (~2 – 6/7 years) 
	interact w world thru language, imagery, still egocentric
	animism + pretend play 
	**cognitive goal of using symbols in thinking**
• Concrete Operational Stage (~7 – 12 years) 
	converse + think logically - and also understand reversibility - pour water from one container to the other + go back
	classification - can group things 
	**cognitive goal: logical thinking**
• Former Operational Stage (~12+)
	develop ideas in abstract world without physical constraints, easy conversation + logic 
	tackle moral philosophical and moral issues. 
applicable across cultures and places in order. but time span to complete stage may vary, and not all will reach formal operational stage

Erikson's stages
8 sequential stages of psychosocial development 
• Each stage is characterized by an **opposing tendency with which an individual is confronted with a conflict and must resolve in order to develop a positive, adaptive or negative, maladaptive trait**
- identity crisis coining from him ![[Erikson's Stages.png]]
- from amboss - covers parts of your graphs and fill it in! 
	- **infancy - stranger danger , 2nd most tested**
	- **early child - 1-4 - exploring on my own, but wait, parents still there. gets will, 3rd most tested** 
	- play age - 3-5 yo 
	- **schoolage - 5-6 yo to 11 yo - gettin competent! Most freq tested**
	- adolescence for identity 
Frued: **most TESTED**
Id – unconscious and instinctual, i**mmediate gratification (present from birth);** pleasure principle 
Ego – decision-making; **reality principle** (seeks satisfaction via **practical strategies**); mediates the id and the “real” world

![[Freud's Changes.png]]
stage 3 and stage 4 are the most commonly tested.
