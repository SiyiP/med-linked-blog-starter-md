We still ask all the qs we know but these are just emphasized. 
![[1.+Child+Interview_Ritchie_NOTES-compressed.pdf]]

Basic Construct is the Same: HPI,ROS,PMHx,FHx,Soc
Different structure from a problem visit (CC)
- Well-check/screening focused instead majority are preventative care  
What is a **triad?**
- patient, parent/caregiver, provider - a different dynamic 
4/5-12 school age population tested 

**Slide 9+10 - Age of Developmental Stages with motor, cognitive etc skills in mind**
> ==1 year old: first words, point to communicate a request== 
> ==2 years old: 2 word phrases, 50 words, 50% intelligible, follows 2-step commands== 
> ==3 years old: 3 word phrases, “why” questions, 75% intelligible== 
> ==4 years old: 100% intelligible==

**Medical Interview**
Introduction 
- ==at 6 mon, maybe just acknowledge the baby and then start talking to the parent== 
- ==5-7+ y/o, engage w/ child/parent in the same;== 
	- "Anything going on this summer?" to kid + then "what's going on this summer" to parent
	- “My name is Dr. Ritchie. What’s your name? And who did you bring with you today?" 
		- if they can't say, ask the caregiver "Who all am I meeting today?” 
		- "I want to make sure I'm saying your name right. What do you like people to call you?" - **never guess **

HPI: Well Check : **start asking child, and then ask caregiver "tell me a bit more about that/anything you'd like to ask?"**
==-Concerns - Do you have any concerns?==
==• Diet : Foods, Food Groups? What type of liquids are you taking in?== 
==• Elimination : Stool habits/Peeing , frequency ; 2 mon - 24 mon, potty training questions== 
==• Behavior : What behavioral concerns do you have? most have tantrums around age 1.== 
==• Sleep habits : time waking? going in bed? any naps?(most stop napping around 4 or 5) kids need more sleep.== 
==• Activities : and school - childcare/daycare? rotating care shifts? any therapies like speech, physical, occupational? sports?== 
How much can I ask the kid v. the caregiver? 
- direct the child a bit. "Let's go back to xyz"

==PMHx== 
==• Birth history==  - were they preterm? did they spend more time in the hospital than like 3 days? more like for a month like in the NICU? 
• ==Allergies== - usually don't know that much. Seasonal or environmental allergies more applicable to know. 
• ==Immunizations== - are they up to date? (good to ask for just this week)
	but in other people like for ER recs - consider do we need to know the booster if the kid cuts themselves on a nail when they're 8 but the previous TDAP was just when they were 4. Are we partially or fully vaxed? this is important 

==FHx==
==• Childhood illnesses== - Significant Childhood illnesses? Been to the hospital for ex asthma exasterbations? eczema, allergies? Chronic childhood illnesses **particularly ones that land you in the hospital**
==• Sibling health== - genetic components 

==SocHx==
==• Who’s in the home== - like pets? 
==• School, grade== - make sure you ask: name of school, grade, how are you doing academically? how did that testing go? 
==• Smoking exposure== - Anyone smoke in or around the home?  
• ==Guns== - we don't have to ask it this week, but the guns @ home question can be asked. 
	Be SMART mneumonic for the framework in asking about guns *add backlink when we get lecture*

==Screening Q - Extra things== 
• ==Developmental milestone==s - if older you can ask about these. 
	*we will get new lectures for these - add link when we get it* 
	 
• ==Lead exposure -== anticipatory guidance lecture. we have a lot of lead in the city. 
• ==Risk factors for hyperlipidemia== - in family : obesity, fm hx of early cholesterolemia? 
• ==Risk factors for vision or hearing loss== - when did mom get glasses or family members ? family who are deaf? who lose vision? 
==• Fluoride exposure / Dental Care - at about 3 yrs, floss.== Using fluoride toothpaste? and how much 

Anticipatory Guidance - introduction

Next expected dev milestones, etc? car/booster seats? Lifestyle medicine 

MNEUMONICS:
