![[22. Child Psychiatry I and II_Roten_NOTES.pdf]]

note - we haven't had the general psych/neuro health - but she'll point out differences
overview - a lot of diagnostic criteria 
comorbidity is common in child psych 
common are psych disorders in kids and adolescents. 
many pediatricians practice child psych in their day to day work. 

==key components of a mental health assessment - mood, energy, concentration, function in environments like school / home etc.== 
when interviewing kids - mostly parents are giving most of the hx 
creativity + enthusiasm is huge
younger kids have difficulty separating from parents, but in kids 8-10 give more time with just the kid 
use tools like art , drawing pictures etc with them. appropriate and strategic toys to build rapport. 

==for adolescents - changes in mood, motivation, thought process/content best reported by adolescent. goals for appts are different than that of parents + guardians== 
- ==changes in behavior, socialization, attention + performance best given by others not them.== 
- confidentiality - discuss upfront, and spend more time with the teen 

specific psych disorders - directly from DSM 5 
==mood disorders==
- ==disruptive mood dysreg disorder DMDD - *only in kids* not adults  onset be4 age 10==  
	- ==fairly newer dx... highlights kids w/ this pattern = **more likely to have depression as opposed to bipolar in adulthoood**==
	- ==more chronic specific and persistent irritability rather than an episode.==
	- ==severe recurrent temper outbursts - out of proportion to age. + the situation== 
	- ==outbursts 3+ times per week, mood is persistently irritable between outbursts==
	- ==symptoms present in at least 2 settings,== 
	- onset of symptoms is before age 10 
- ==depression - common in kids, more in girls after puberty.== 
	- ==earlier onset , worse the prognosis==
	- ==higher risk for recurrence== 
	- kids - more likely to deny depression, ==more presenting with irritability, boredom, grades down, somatic complaints + decreasing other hobbies.==
	- - depressed ==most the day or every day nearly - feels sad **or irritable** by the kid or others think so; empty, hopeless. 2 wks +== 
	- significant weight loss or gain 5% change. or change in appetite. ==in children, c**onsider failure to make weight gain**. problem with sleep ...== 
- ==persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - depressed mood for most the day, for at least *2 years*== 
	- 2 years
	- "depression lite?" - in kids mood can be irritable and duration for at least 1 yr 
- ==bipolar - late adolescence, early 20s onset==
	- equal prevalence
	- ==65% concordance in monozygotic twins - hugely family hx genetic thing== 
	- ==first id'd episode of bipolar disorder is often a depressive episode.== 
	- substance use , sexual activity, antisocial behavior 
- ==suicide - 2nd leading cause in youth aged 12-18== 
	- lgbtq+ at elevated risk, huge 
	- aacap.org - facts for families, risk factors
	- ==safety planning for suicide - easier for kids than adults==
		- ==inquire directly abt suicidal thoughts - at a developmental level==
			- ==do you wish sometimes that you weren't alive? to young kids.== 
			- ==thoughts about not wanting to wake up? hurting yourself?==  
		- ==ideation, plan, intent, means , preparation==
		- ==id risk factors. + protective factors==
			- ==protective factors - family support, plans for the future.== 
		- ==if access to weapons/danger remove them== 
		- ==increased observation + direct monitoring; sometimes hospitalization== 
		- safety planning can be easier given role of guardians 

==anxiety disorders ==
10% of kids have these... shy kids at higher risk for developping it . 
include hyperactivity + inattention as symptoms. good eval for adhd rules out, but are also common comorbidities
- ==separation anxiety disorders==
- ==selective mutism== 

==obsessive compulsive + related = same criteria for adults== 
- ==OCD - obsessions thoughts , and compulsions are the behaviors. sometimes they might not be able to pick out the thought== 
- body dysmorphic 
- hoarding
- trichotillomania
- excoriation 

==trauma + stressor related disorders==
- ==adjustment disorders==
- ==reactive attachment disorder/==  same antecedent as early trauma 
	- ==RAD- withrawan behavior to adult caregivers when distressed,==
	- less emotional responsiveness to other 
	- significant social neglect early on 
- ==disinhibited social engagement - same antecedent as early trauma==
	- ==overly familiar with unfamiliar adults== 
- ==ptsd - in kids *more than 6 yrs,* *repetitive* *play* may occur in the themes of the trauma. recurring dreams + flashbacks. recurrent/distressing dreams or interruptions.== 

ACE study - higher rate of mental + physical consequences. most adults had at least 1 ace. 

adjustment disorders - similar in kids + adults - frequent thing
- ==identifiable stressor in adjustment disorder = occurs within 3 months of the onset of this.== 
- response and distress out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor. 
- ==significant impairment. but once the stressor/consequences terminated, symptoms dont persist for more than an additional 6 mon== 
- specify what mood or what distress it is 

==disruptive impulse control== 
- ==oppositional defiant disorder -== 
	- ==hard to follow the rules== 
	- what's the normal epectation? looking at all the interactions and caregivers
	- must be develpmentally inappropriate to make the dx. 
	- must be in 2+ environments. but no longer has to be to meet criteria 
	- ==**less of a mood component than in DMDD**==
	- ==angry/irritable/loses temper==
	- ==touchy, resentful, chronic . spiteful / vindictive 2x during the past 6 months.== 
	- ==huge - therapy is the biggest thing.== 
==conduct disorder== 
- aggression + destruction of property + law breaking. 
- ==more severe version of oppositional defiant disorder== 

other - 
Substance use - common in teens 
- ==don't assume they never used. good to screen early - 10-12 yo is good to screen substance abuse== 
- ask if anyone they know 
- kids who experiment dont go on to get serious problem. but the ones that do, consequences are grave. 
- ==CRAFFT is useful for screening SU. all use is problematic== 
	- screening tool for age 12-21 
	- ==in the past 12 mon - how many days did you xyz with alc/smoking==

- ==imaginary friend - normal in younger== 
- schizophrenia in males onset late teens
- ==involves medical workup like labs, mri,eeg== 

==neurodev disorders - all start early on and are persistent== 
- ==intellectual disabilities== - onset in develpmental period. cognitive + adaptive (activities of daily life etc) functioning are both impacted and has deficits.
	- ==mild, moderate, severe, profound. used to be iq corresponds. but now about **how severe is their adaptive functioning?** has to be 2 sds below the mean on iq tests + deficits in adaptive functioning== 
- ==communication disorders==
	- ==social communication disorder - difficulty in verbal + nonverbal cmmunication, not reach full criteria of autism== 
		- ==struggle to ebb and flow regular convo.==

		- deficits in social emotional reciprocity 
		- deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors 
		- deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships 
		- restricted repetitive patterns of behaviors, at least 2 on the list of stimming, highly restrictive interests, sensory + inflexible routines. 
		- specifiers - we can have with or without intellectual impairment. or language impairment, or associated with known med/genetic condition/environmental factor... but associated w another disorder. 
		- eval - at 18 and 24 months ... but m-chat is.a common tool in peds offices for kids 16 - 30 months. after screening use a comprehensive dev eval. with ADI, ADOS(gold standard), CARS  
- ==ADHD - consistent inattention/hyperactivity-impulsivity==

- ==specific learning disorder==

- ==tic disorders - can be common fairly. just bc of tic doesn't mean they have a tic disorder ; generally *start 4-6 yrs, peak 10-12* then decline== 
	- ==tourettes - both multiple motor + 1+ vocal tics that are consistent. onset before 18, wax and wane, but persisted for 1+ years.==
