refusal, etc how to counsel ppl on vaccinations. 
vaccines prevent diseases + save lives! 
hesitancy and refusal - has become politicized. relatively new term, behavior of someone who's influenced 
might decide to vaccinate children, alt schedule or some other thing? 
ultimately some people are outright refusers. 
cautious accptor- minor concerns, just some questions
==fence sitter - might have articles or a lot of questions about the vaccines, more mistrust + distrust in you as a provider. can gt fully vacinated or sometimes they are vaccinated. ***place where we make the most diff***==
refuser - ppl who refuse no matter what, have done their own research. 
vaccine hesitancy is not new. mistrust of the med system among black people (tuskagee experiment) and sterilization of indigenous women. 
modern anti-vax - 80s-90s. dr andrew wakefield - vaccines + autism. a lot of dmg from a fraudulent link. 

covid - mistrust in med system, etc. so much unification between people who didn't trust it. vaccination of adults trickled down into childhood vaccine distrust. AI geneated misinformation , growing distrust, social media amp. 

global - vaccinations has dropped - got behind in covid , gotten more and more down in the us for kids over time. 
lower vax rate among black, hispanic, ai/an children, insured by medicaid, rural, uninsured, etc 

high disease burden + no vaccine = we get it 
then we get vaxxed and the disease burden is low, ppl start thinking to not get vaxxed anymore.

counseling 
==fully unvax - white, higher income, more educated, full acess but refuses==
==under vaxxed - public insurance/uninsured, AA, lower income , less edu, miss due to system issues. - takes a lot of time to set up a new schedule + education. we need to have a convo with them== 

some countries out of us - mandate vax. but in the us , we req in case of med emergencies + generally refuse vaccines for med/non med reaosns. 

med exemptions - allowed by all state. 
3 states - non med exemptions. - like personal belief, religious etc. ==SC only med and religious exemption== 
==concerns - safety, ASD, ingredients, quantity of vax, pain for kid, and politicization.== 
autism - start seeing near that time, 
==vaccines are toxic - thimerosal== 
- ==mercury based preservative to prevent bacterial growth . not the same as mercury ... thought to cause neuro effects==
- ==has been removed by FDA , but still used in multi dose flu  vaccines + DTaP - Hib -== 
	-  ==**was used in processing but later removed, trace amounts.**==
	- no data of causing adverse effects. 
==adjuvants - aluminum mostly - make stronger immune response==
- ==it's also in air, food, water, comparable to amount exposed thru breastmilk + formula== 
- ==**possible link w asthma**==
- ==you can lessen your aluminum burden by not using tin foil, pans, etc,,, basically other ways.== 

too many vaccines would overwhelm my childs immune system
- FDA studied tha its fine
- givinvg multiple is better, and safe, 
- kids exposed to hundreds-thousands of antigens in the first few yrs of life 

vaccines cause infection - except live attenuated, only part of the bacteria/virus are in these products
- most common SE are due to immune response not the disease

i don't wanna hurt my child - they're resilient and no long term dmg
- ways to mitigate pain - vaccines giving in combo quickly 
- tactile stimulation , distraction, sweet liquids, topical anesthetics. 

religious concerns
- based on the thought that vacines have cells from human fetuses
- ==tricky to discuss about religion - encourage to talk to their religious leaders abt vaccines and their concerns.== 

==political hesitancy - acknowledge conflicting info, refocus on shared common goal of child health, avoid direct challenges, reinforce yourself as trusted messenger.== 
- "there's sm conflicting info out there online and in news, hard to know what to believe"
- refocuse - shared/common goal is health and safety of cild
- avoid - direct challenges 
- reinofrce - yurself as trusted messenger even wit decreased trust 

counter misinformation - if presented w/ info, gently ask about the sources/studies and ask to read them. 
- reinforce and encourage high quality evidence - CDC, AAP , large scale studies. 
- avoid directly debunking every peice of misinfo in detail 

==open ended, affirmations, reflections, ask perm to share, autonomy support - all Motivational intrviewing for vaccine counseling.== 
AAP - they should fill out a refusal to vaccinate form for the visit if they refuse. 
- not absolutely required , but good to have
- also let tehm know you'll label the kid as undervax or unvax in their records so that if they go into the ER or hospital, they need more testing done, more pokes and draws 

==alt schedules - more fear made, not evidence based, prolongs time child is susceptible to certain illnesses - the last ditch effort, lots of fear mongering== 
last ditch effort - only consider this here. 
- the vaccine book - fear mongering. but a veryyy common thing.  
- ==debunk by telling them where the source is and who's the author "he lost his lisence bc pts died or almost died of preventable diseases."==
==use prescriptive language - ur kid is due for their ___ today, do you have any questions about it - just assume they'll have the vaccine.== 
give them info sheets before the visit.
