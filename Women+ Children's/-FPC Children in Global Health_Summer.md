global health + children - there's mortality of kids <5, 99% are from low income countries 
a lot of progress in reducing these deaths 
seen that thy're highest in subsarahan africa then South asia 
how does the US compare with other wealthy countries - 75% higher infant mortality rate. and also 15-19 age, due to firearms + motor vehicle accidents 

==globally - most common cause of mortality = pneumonia ; acute respiratory infections!== 
- ==caused by RSV, influenza, etc. usually malnurished + deficiencies + suboptimal treatment options.== 
- shortage of healthcare workers, delay in seeking care, lack of dx tools , limited availability of antibx and oxygen therapy 
- ==increasing antimicrobial resistance in many countries== 
vaccination is huge+breastfeeding + sanitation + healthcare in a timely manner
==most common perinatal/neonate death = prematurity== 
- quality prenatal care is put in , at least 4 in these countries 
- availability of emergency ob care c section 
- kangaroo mother care helps encourage skin to skin + help warm them 

==diarrheal diseases = caused by rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, reduced by ORS!! (:== 
- oral rehydration solution ORS - discovery that Na and glucose transport are couples - glucose will accelerate absorption of solute and water
- resulted in reducing deaths in children + toddlers 
dropped the usage. needs to push again to use it - readily avaliable 
helps reduce deaths - recommend continued feeding like whatever protein source there is 
- ==zinc supplementation global (not in the us)==
- improving female education 

==diarrheal illness will weaken gi, that give malnutrition which causes other infections so much.== 
- malnutrition - biggest role in child death 
- protein energy malnutrition - 
	- stunting- common form , chronic, really common - tooo short due to insufficient calories, vitamin + mineral def diet, disease. brain dev lags - poor learning. 
	- kwashiokor + maramsmus -
		- kwashiokor - "displaced child" - wasting in arm, edema due to low albumin, enlarged fatty liver, apathy , lightened hair color. 
		- marasmus - severe fom of proteinenergy malnutrition - huge wasting - like in war torn areas + famine. 

==WHO - exclusive breastfeeding - continue up until 2 years, but introduce safe complementary foods at 6 months== 

==vaccine preventable dz - biggest contagious - measles. most contagious disease!!!==
- coverage has fallen worldwide - and then plateaued 
- vaccination - most commonly the bad cases are with kids who are vitamin A deficient 

==polio - impact kids under 5 yo, 1/200 infection leads to paralysis== 
- ==endemic in afghanistan + pakistan.== 
- almost completely eradicated 

==neonatal tetanus - rural areas and inadequate sterile procedures esp during unsterile delivery==
- caused by potent neurotoxin made in growth of bacteria in dead tissues like in dirty wounds or in umbilicus after nonsterile delivery 
==prevention - **immunize the moms against tetanus**==

==parasite - most responsible for death== 
- ==**plasmodium falciparum**= malaria== 
- 1/2 population is still at risk of malaria - still many who die though ): majority in sub sarahan africa. 
intervention cycle : 
- ==well nourished mother with prental cares, HIV medicines, exclusive breast feeding, 6 month introduce the solid food, , nets to reduce malaria, and ORT access.==
