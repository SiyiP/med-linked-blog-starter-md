#womenchild #clinics 

in 2019 - firearm injuries are the leading cause of death in our country 
- homicides= most common but there are more unintential injuries in younger, teenager suicides by firearms. 
- racial disparities - in all deaths black children at higher rate. 
- 6th highest rate of gun violence in the usa. in south carolina

firearm access - talk about this with parents. majority of kids are very aware of where the gun is. 1/4th of the parents don't know that the kids had handle the gun 
90% off unintential inuries and suicides happen in the home
78% of shooters under 18 get gun from home or relative

firearm - most lethal suicide attempt 

prevention 
educate children? - **not effective.**  they would still play with guns. 
- we can't rely on kids to make the change
we need to do responsible storage. 
- locked , unloaded, separate from ammunition 
AAP- we should routinely screen for firearm access and counsel about risk eduction. 
provide something tangible like a gun lock 
EHR - prompts put in about firearms + smoke alarms, but we were still less likely to ask about the firearms ): 

be SMART
S - secure all guns in homes and vehicles , make sure they're locke,d unloaded, separate from ammunition. hiding is NOT securing. 
M- model responsible behavior - it's our responsibility to avoid guns, make it a regular conversation - if you see a gun don't touch it. let an adult know 
A - ask about unsecured guns in other homes - make it a regular thing when sending kid to a new home . try email or text. 
R - recognize role of guns in suicide - safe storage does decrease it 
T - tell your peers. just let them know 
every child is asked these questions at every well check + inpatient floors 

counseling tips 
- ask = if there are firearms where your child lives and plays, how are they stored? - less accusatory 
	- "firearms are kept away" - "okay, tell me more about that" - get their exact definition of safe storage. 
- educaition - safe storage or offer to move the playdate to a neutral area 
- if the thing is "we don't have any" - open them up to discussing it w others esp parents they sent kids on a playdate with. 
sample language
 -“Let's talk about some everyday safety issues. Many families I see have firearms in their homes, and I talk with each of them about how to help keep their families safe. If you have firearms, can we talk about how you store them?”
▸ “Kids can be curious and they like to explore everything. And we know that even the best kids don't always follow the rules.” 
 ▸ “Teens can be impulsive, and if they get depressed or some unexpected crisis happens, if guns are accessible, they might use it to harm themselves. And when guns are used in a suicide attempt, it's almost always fatal."

always provide a gun lock - still offer - gun locks for free at the childrens hospital 
frame the convo of safe storage as risk mitigation - use the swimming pool analogy 
- "if you got a pool in your back yard, i dont wanna take away your pool. but just secure it wit a fence like im securing a firearm and locking it"

legislation - safe storage laws but no federal laws. 
SC doesn't have it lol 

effective physician advocacy. 
do more and more researh 
speak out - op ed, letter to editor, media interview
- start to community orgs - newspapers, getting on tv
legislative advocacy - contating elected officials, state/local levels - 
- senators phone numbers are there on your phone, call it on your phone , leave a voicemail 
public testimony too 
lobbying - musc - go to state house and then stand and talk with legislatures that impact children. 
on a federal level - there's the AARP national advocacy conference, which is where people can talk to senators in person 

in other work - research to inform the policy debate + work on an advocacy curriculum. identify trainees in advocacy + mentor. 

AFSVP - advcates for firearm safety + viol
