![[Continuity Of Care and Impact on Relations_Haley_PPT (1).pdf]]

continuity of care - over a spectrum of life. we know the part of their story and that impacts how we give care; **reduce the fragmentation of care**
- quality of care over time - managed by a team based approach to healthcare. 
- do not miss - physician led - this is not delegated out. **make sure it remains like a physician led team**

patient - continuity of care = idealized with an individual. 
provider - delivery of seamless service thru integration, coordination and sharing of information between providers... can rarely be accomplished w/ just one. 
- this is a service industry - focus on sharing of info all across the notes. 
- continuity on provider side - case management + multidisciplinary team working. 
- shift to provider patient continuity to team patient continuity 
- look @ satisfaction and efficiency feedback - how they would grade not us, but our team. 
	- we care about pt satisfaction but not everything we care about. 
doctors cannot do it all . we need to delegate. 

==alternative views- 3 types of continuity of care==
- ==informational continuity - use and transfer of info from one provider to another, making sure that current care is appropriate== 
- ==management continuity - consistent, coherent + responsive approach to the care. am i managing it the same way my subspecialists are== 
- ==relational continuity - therapeutic relation between an individual pt w/ one or more providers. soo much bigger than we think== 

how to foster continuity 
panel management - appropriate patient attribution to providers within med record? charts, etc. followups. how many patients are saying "Angel Li is my doctor"; 2-4k people. lately might be wayy too high. shrink your size/? 

open scheduling - access is a major limiter to continuity in real time practice, allowing pt open scheduling access = but can cause increased burnout. 
- like time limitations for emergencies, no appointments for like weeks so i go to urgent care and then do something random and that never gets back to my pcp. 
- note - burnout for staff like nurses etc is huge too, with too many patients, **remember, their pay isn't tied to how many patients they're seeing.**

pools/interdisciplinary care teams - introduction of all care team members on initial visits 
consistency in utilizing these pools/teams is then essential. 
APP - hey if you come in and im not here, youre gonna see Dr.xyz for instance. = sharing this cohort of people. 

==care coordination - organizing pt care activities sharing info among all participants concerned w/ pt care to achieve safer + more effective care== 
- ==preplanned conversations = like advanced care planning== 
- know their needs. + prefs known ahead of time and to the right time to the right people. 
everybody that touches healthcare in care coordination is huge. they all use different software. 

==effectiveness of care coordination - look @== 
- ==hospital readmission, morbidity/mortality, prescriptions filled, time to follow up appointment==
	- our wait for pysch is like 8-9 months ): 
- patient perceptions - satisfaction surveys , press ganey, healthgrades ; patients look at this to tell what type of dr you are. 

==hotspotting- interventions - as an attempt to mitigate "superusers"==
==80/ 20 rule - 20% of the USA accounts for 80% of healthcare expenditure==
- ==superutilizers - frequent contact w healthcare system but minimal improvement in their health== 
- top 1% of pts account for almost 25% of healthcare spending
- we can target these patients to decrease costs! don't just go to the ER every time you have a cough, you can see someone else. 
unfortunately - once they do it in a randomized control trial...
- ==**it doens't work,,, basically care and reductions vs standard care is not that big**==
- ==ppl spend so much in acute crises. -> result in them spending a lot more money, but this is **really temporary, like the crisis could resolve in a small amount of time.** and then they stop using the care as much.== 
basically alternative predictors are needed to see who's gonna be big users. 
instead of hotspots, who has that rising risk? 

==transitions of care - high risk times- whenever we move from one care center to another, this is a massive risk to the patient.== 
- ==hospital discharge - transitional care management , case management/placement (readmission within 30 days is a major flag - how do we follow what meds we do)==
- ==clinic referral - referral coordinators, patient feedback (then the referral might not be picked up!!!; and patient voicemails aren't good)==
- ==shift changes - iPASS, SBAR==
- ==leaving post-acute care - Home health, pcp f/u==
- ==weekends - staffing continuity, call coverage - everything flips bc no one wants to work these!== 

care coordination interventions - many systems still do hotspotting , making some bundles
- ==acute care intervention -== 
	- ==bundled ; early discharge planning, like when you go home, who's taking care of you? etc.== 
	- ==patient education, and then the pharmacist shows up== 
	- follows up post-discharge; post-acute care + home 
	- greatly helped lower ER use and fewer follow up visits 
- ==community intervention== 
	- ==predictive - deployed community health workers, behavioralists, nurse care managers==
	- ==not helpful for medicare pts but helpful for medicaid (low SDOH, so basically environmental).== 
	- reduced avoidable hospitalizations 
- ==chronic care management==
	- medicare pts ONLY, eligible - ppl w 2 chronic conditions 
	- ==monthly calls, bilable service from care coordinators to help pts achieve set goals from provider to improve chronic conditions== 
	- monthly goals and touchups - they can call and follow up on this stuff 
- ==Collab care management== 
	- ==focused on medicare, mental health and psych patient==
	- ==partnership w primary care physician, care manager / coordinator, psych consultant==
	- increased reimbursement for behavioral health services in primary care. 
interpersonal medicine - huge with pateint provider/team context. 
pediatrics - suicidal thoughts + behaviors are related to social connectedness. 
geriatrics - low levels emotional support + social engagement = faster cognitive decline. 

==social isolation point - loneliness - subective response associated w/ social isolation - loss or lack of compainionship -==
- solitude = fine, loneliness is not 
- ppl with severe loneliness is like smoking 15 cigs a day 
improved relaitonships = lead in many improvements. 

==societal level==
==FMLA - family med leave act - you can leave work and not get fired if you need to care for an ill family member==
health insurance - home health + 24/7 care
policies to protect known vulnerable populations - women , esp widowhood AA people 
growing evidence - social isolation in lower SE communities 

Connect2Affect - from AARP foundation - trying to get ppl connected esp in the medicare world 
https://connect2affect.org/

be aware - of our role. 
identify social connectedness - asset or a weakness, SDoH
- build a therapeutic alliance, don't underestimate the power of presence
