![[11. Contraception_Dempsey_NOTES.pdf]]

a therapy for multiple conditions
- abnormal uterine bleeding, pcos, endometriosis, anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding, hormone sensitive conditions like menstrual migranes, etc. 
- 2-3 children are ideal in the US. 3 years woman is pregnant, postpartum or trying to get pregnant. 
- 3 decades to avoid pregnancy
women 15-44 - have used at least one form of contraception in their lifetime. 
most ppl use pill + permanent female contraception most commonly. 
think of our national health goals - healthy ppl 2030 - public health goals of family planning 
- mostly reduce proportion of pregnancies unintended, or within 18 month of previous birth + in adolescents. 
bc pill - one of greatest public health achievements + reduces risk of ovarian / endometrial cancer.s 

help pts make sense of wide array of contraceptives. 
==think of it anatomically: - anything that does something with progesterone = will deal with preventing ovulation.== 
==![[moa overview contraceptives.png]]==
==progesterone - inhibits LH surge from pituitary gland, inhibiting ovulation and menstruation- primary contraceptive==
	==thickens mucus of cervix==
	==decreases cilia motility of fallopian tube==
	==endometrial atrophy== 
==estrogen - inhibits FSH in turn suppressing follicle dev from the pituitary gland. - bleeding control will continue with the combined hormones, also more predictable== 
mechanisms of action in IUD 
- ==copper inc copper ion IUD -> spermicidal==
- ==levonogestrel IUD - will thicken cervical mucus, endometrial activity, about 50% users don't ovulate. hormonal iud users.== 

==reasons to avoid hormones - CI to estrogen breast cancer, pt pref, medication interactions==
combined methods v. prog only methods under hormones 
- ==permanent - fem perm, vascectomy== 
- ==long acting - copper iud + LNG IUD + implant== 
providers - required to deal with permanent fem/male contraceptives like IUDs/implants. 
==prescription - oral contra, patch, ring, injection (stop on your own, but prescription only)==
==self initiated - condoms, Opill (prog only) without prescription, etc.== 
![[contraception bleeding effectvs.png]]pts need to know - how well does it work? efficacy - 
- contraceptive failure - % users who become pregnant within first 12 months of initiating use!
- typical use = failure rate taking into accoutn inconssitent/incorrect use by some users. 
- perfect use - failure rate in perfect setting, highly controlled research based stuff. 
==implant + IUD - most efective reversible methods + also permanent method too== 
educate on reminders, and what to do if they miss the pill 
think of typical v perfect use- we see them line up completely with implant, vasectomy, etc. 
gap widens a lot with "less effective methods"
safety is huge too
- ==CI to estrogen therapies - risk of venous or arterial thromboembolism== 
- DVT hx? or PE / htrombophilia
- SLE with poz antiphospholipid antibodies
- immobilization/surg
- pospartum hypercoag 42 days postpartum 
- ==smokers 35+ breast cancer, migranes , severe htn. = more coagulation to be aware of with estrogen therapies== 
==breastfeeding women can safely intitate prog only methods (postpartum women are hypercoagulable) + e after 42 days immediately.== 

- will contraception worsen condition or decrease effectiveness of concurrent therapies
- will cndition/concurrent meds decrease efficacy of contraception method? 
one ex) p450 system ramped up by anti epileptic drugs
- hx of bariatric surgery - less likely oral absorption

great resource - we can get all the information from an app! safety of what they'd like to use.
