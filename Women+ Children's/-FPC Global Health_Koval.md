omg this powerpoint is scuffed. 

global health - health issues beyond national boundaries - prevention, clinical, health equity, veryyy interdisciplinary + multidisciplinary 
international hlth - isues outside of ones own country, binational, help others
public health - focus on our own communities - health equity in the nation 

focus on health equity - extra attention given to people in need. 
equality - eveyrone gets equal chance
there's opportunity to improve global health in SC - think of PCPs to increase into rural areas - are much worse outcome 
there's a lack of indoor plumbing in some places. 
our population is very diverse! refugees and ppl with other bgds need to come here. - health disparities, appreciate other heatlh systems + beliefs, and preventing epidemics too .. 
- we can learn from each othr! diversity + fulfilment in career is good burnout prevention!! 

where do we deicde where to invest our efforts/
- ==**world bank funds based on income,** using Gross National Income==
	- ==low income, low middle, upper mid, and high income== 
	- ==LMIC - low middle income country== 
- ==**based on international org recs -** *WHO or unicef* - tells us the *sustainable development goals* - we have 17 , each have targets and each is mapped with an indicator.== 
train the midwife, access to birth control, etc. 
pregnancies in children aged 10-14 = high rate of complications + difficulties + disparities. - suffering in terms of gender equality too 
big 4 focus on these. 
big 3 - HIV, Tb, Malaria. frequetnt killers. + vaccination preventabilities. 
first vaccine = hep b sooo easily preentable. 
mental health - is not viewed the same as physical healt in many countries. 
- **population health indicators** - how do we report the data? getting acurate data is really hard. important aside - we spend more than anyone but our system is bad 
**==top 3 causes of maternal mortality**== 
- ==**hemorrhage**==
- ==**htn**== 
- ==**sepsis==** 
newr study - early detection of postpartum hemorrhage - taking tranexanmic acid, how much blood is measured lost in delivery? put a drape that collects the blood in a drape? - looking at how much blood is lost in the delivery process
- early detection of postpartum hemorrhage by measuring the blood loss 
about neonatal mortality rate - leading cause of neonatal mortality - perinatal asphyxia
helping babies breathe = educationla program with mortality benefit seen!

worldwide mortatliy - ischemic heart disease
- **is a country developed or not?** 
LMIC or low income countries = most socially acceptable 
dislike developing world - bc of the hiearchy made
==epidemiologic transition - when birth and death rates decrease due to better quality of life for women, and increase in life expectancy and then a plateau - stronger health system will help transition us.== 
also changing = cause of death - from infectious dz to non communicable diseases. 
- **based on burden of disease**
daly - disability adjusted life years - you cause suffering + early death 
1 DALY = one lost year of healthy life. 
==biggest thing that causes most DALYs = neonatal conditions bc of the life expectency + disabilty years. also why some diarrheal diseases go up== 
- ==but COPD goes down bc it primarily affects older people== 

many argue that dALYs are more reflective rather than life expectancy
