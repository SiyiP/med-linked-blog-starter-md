![[Intelectual Development Disorders & Medical Comorbidities for Patients with Intellectual Disabilities_Carpenter_PPT.pdf]]
#womenchild 
we have a down syndrome clinic led by dr angela larosa! 

there's some major shifts in how we treat intellectual developmental disabilities
- like nowadays we get exposure to them. more respect for autonomy 
- anytime we think of policies, include them in the process of decision making
- LEND program here - including ppl from all fields + self-advocates 

don't have to memorize 
 Neurodevelopmental Disorders (DSM-5): Disorders of brain development with onset in childhood, affecting cognition, behavior, or motor function.  - more systemic medial disordders engaged 
 Developmental Disabilities (Legal/Service Term): Chronic conditions due to physical and/or mental impairments, emerging before age 22, likely lifelong. - more likely to be ADHD etc. 
intellectual disability + autism in both . 

==almost 20% of ppl have some sort of dev disability. super common. autism is huge too, 3% prevalence.== 
==intellectual disability - defined by IQ==

==global dev delay - 0-5 yrs, not meeting milestones **delays in 2+ areas**==
- ==might be transient , over half are okay but half do transition to a diagnosis of intellectual disability 5+ yrs of age.== 

==intellectual disabilities - onset under 18. 2 sectors== 
- ==cognitive functioning delay - reasoning,learning, problem solving==
- ==deficits in adaptive behavior covers a range of everyday social+practical skills.== 

how iq works - ==85-115 = avg. based off percentiles and comparisons to peers, measures cognitive functioning==
lower than 70 = intellectual disability. 
grey area = borderline people. slow learners, harder to keep up. not a ton of supports ): - severe behavioral challenges - harder to deal with 

==adaptive behavior - more important in predicting outcomes - how much support do we actually need?== 
- ==conceptual = academics==
- ==social = how we interact w the world, social judgement== 
- ==practical - bathe self, use bus, can we drive?==
DSMV def of intellectual disability - **some deficit or impairment in one domain**

l==level of severity based on IQ== 
==mild 55-70, intermittent support==
==moderate 40-55, limited support (down syndrome)==
==severe 25-40 - extensive support==

causes of intellectual disability - lots of causes, don't know them all 
2 main ones 
- genetic - can be de novo too 
	- chromosomal disorders
	- x linked
	- autosomal dom
	- AR
	- microdeletion 
- acquired -
	- prenatal - congenital infections TORCH, rubella, CMV herpes, ;; substance use, maternal illness, toxins 
	- perinatal - birth asphyxia, extreme premie,
	- postnatal- meningitis, encephalitis, sepsis, brain injury , malnutrition, neglect(such as kids from international orphanages), lead poisoning 

most common causes
==down syndrome==
- ==most common genetic cause of ID== 
- 1/800 live births
- pregnancy termination for this is going down. more willing to go forth, more services, etc. 
- trisomy 21, translocation in 3-4% cases or mosaicism (facial features but not cognitive ones)
- ==mild to moderate ID, starting in 1st year.== 
- ==avg age of sitting 11 mo, and walking 26 mo 2x the age expected== 
- ==first words at 18 mon vs 12-15 mons normally== 
- ==IQ declines thru 1st 10 yrs of age... plateau in adolescence that continues into adulthood==
	- ==they learn @ slower rate, so bigger gap between their peers and them.== 
	- make sure to explain what iq is to the parents. 
- ==<3 conditions, hearing loss, leukemia risk, early alzheimers==

==Fragile X==
- ==common INHERITED CAUSE (down syndrome is spontaneous)==
- ==FMR1 gene mutation , full mutation happens, premutation is 55-200, of CGG increasing w/ each generation.== 
	- mom - ataxia + premature ovarian failure 
- most severe in males, mild to severe 
- ==long face, large ears, jaw, forehead + macroorchidism, connective tissue signs==
- ==poor eye contact, social anxiety, hand flapping, sensory sensitivities, delays in motor + adaptive skills==
- ==ASD + mitral valve prolapse + seizures==

==fetal alc syndrome==
- acquired + preventable ID
- ==dose dependent effect!== 
- ==microcphaly, growth stop, facial features== 
- mild to moderate
- ==SEVERE ADHD + behavioral problems.== 

high risk populations ): 
- accidental injury due to awareness lack
- untreated med conditions with lack of communication + "disruptive behaviors"
- societal problems - exploitation + abuse. 

CATS - carolina autism transition study 
- individuals who were identified thru the sc autism + DD network. 
- young adults with ID 
	- more likely to have maltreatment
	- pass away before young adulthood
	- treated in the ED 
	- huge thing = elevated rates of abuse + neglect. 
- less likely to receive cancer screening like pap smears / mammograms + vision screening too 
- greater rates of chronic issues there. 

no standard clinical guidelines exist for treating adults w disabilities - huge issue bc nowhere to transfer growing patients too
- not enough time for complex pt visits in current primary care setting 
- no doctors or field that specializes in this. 

interventions + support
==kids <3yrs, everything has "BabyNet" - early intervention program that gives IFSP individualized fm service plan ; at home services + trainings.== 
==3-21 yrs - IEP individualized edu plan or 504 plan thru public school services.== 
==young adult - ITP individualized transition plan at 16 yrs - 22 yrs.==
- ==huge - clemson/usc, etc have programs for non-degree seeking students, going to live with ppl their age and dev more skills. pretty expensive ): also apprenticeship programs== 
- other things = apprenticeship programs 

==IEP==
- ==legal docu==
- ==covered by special ed law, only up to age 21== 
- renewed annually  + updated
- ==provide interventions that require money like therapies, counseling, classroom mods, etc==
==504 plan== 
- ==civil rights law under ADA==
- ==accomodations/mods based on diagnoses, like extended time, xtra textbooks, preferred seating - all levels of edu!== 
- ==no funding for special services / instruction tho==
