IPV inclusive intimate partner violence, sexual violence, childhood physical and sexual abuse
- threatened / actual violence against a person 
intimate partner violence legally: perp is someone they would have a child w/, lives with or married to but broader in society 
be behaviorally specific when talking to the pts: "Slapping, pushing, shoving, strangling, pulling hair, kicking, and use of restraint."
> Impact on PTSD, fearfulness, and severe injury is greater among women than men.
   although the prevalence is somewhat similar, for women greater impact is recorded 

many female homicides are perpetrated by intimate partner, more than half. 
76% women were stalked the month before. 
- Women who have been separated from a partner, left, or asked to leave are 3-4x more likely to experience homicide. they are @ risk in and leaving the relationship, it's a hard decision 
A woman owning her own gun shows no statistics supporting that it'll actually help her in IPV homicide risk, much higher risk of danger instead. - help them weigh it out and connect them with experts on that. 
Homicide is the second leading cause of death among pregnant women - 7x higher for Black women compared to White women - rates increasing from 2021 - pregnancy can be a means of which the perp can control the relationship - high risk of IPV to continue 

Teen dating violence is high among high school students › 1 in 11 female and 1 in 15 male students report physical dating violence in the last year › 1 in 9 female and 1 in 36 male students report sexual dating violence in the last year + 
IPV very common among emerging adults - 18-34 mostly 
IPV is maintained by "socially acceptable or tolerated violence" - some casual things contribute to the broader rape culture 

cycle of abuse - sometimes what it can look like and makes it hard to get out of these relationships 
1. tension builds, 
2. incident
3. reconciliation with apology 
4. calm with eggshells where nothing takes place depends on relationships, hours to years. can be the "hook" that keeps people in 
Slide 37 - can look @ together to analyze type of power/control in violence 
*Prevalence of IPV equal to breast cancer, exceeds hypertension, thyroid problems, and colon CA.*
50% of the men who frequently assaulted their wives also frequently abused their children. - mandated reporting - **we need to report if the child has witnessed it - make sure to share this with them so they know what they want to share.**

Sexual assault reports that do not have sufficient evidence to prove it took place are not the same as a false report Allegations may be dropped because of various factors such as public scrutiny Survivors may recant because of aversive process of sexual assault investigations
-  Rarely does a false report result in a wrongful conviction - 
- also "false reports" are typically from individuals with severe mental health dx such as psychosis 

Inform them of the importance of having information for treatment planning and safety - our goal is not to make them leave - they are the best wisdom for themselves
LEADER › Because violence is common in many people’s lives and can impact health, I have begun to ask all of my patients about it. › I am concerned that your symptoms may be caused by someone hurting you. 
PVS: • Have you been hit, kicked, punched, or otherwise hurt by someone within the past year? If so, by whom? • Do you feel safe in your current relationship? • Is there anyone from a previous relationship who is making you feel unsafe now

DANGER ASSESSMENT-5: 
1. Has the physical violence increased in frequency or severity over the past year? 
2. Has the abuser ever used or threatened to use a gun, knife, or other weapon? 
3. Ever threatened to kill or injure you? 
4. Ever tried to strangle (choke) you? 
5. Is abuser violently or constantly jealous?
- if they say yes to 2+ statistically they are more likely to be killed by their partners. - share this with them. when they think of that, what do you think of it 
“As many as one in four women will experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime.” › “Intimate partner violence is especially prevalent in South Carolina: We rank 6th in the nation in rates of IPV.”
usually this type of violence gets worse over time ; address chronicity . 

IPV is current and ongoing, express concern for the patient’s safety › “ Listening to the the things that you have told me about your current relationship, I am concerned about your safety.” › “Thanks for sharing this with me. I’m so sorry this is happening. What you’re telling me makes me worried about your safety and health.” › “As your doctor, I am concerned about your safety in your relationship. I want you to know that you are not alone and help is available.”
then they'll get to listen to different options and safety planning with the resources that are avaliable. taking the referral is not them making a choice. 

mandated reporting - gunshot wounds
- “Before we get started, I wanted to let you know that I won’t share anything we talk about today outside of the care team here unless you were to tell me about your child being the victim of abuse or observing the violence against you.”
- **always screen without the partner in the room - if you can't get them alone, we cannot screen **
