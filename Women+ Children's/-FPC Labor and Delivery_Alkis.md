ob hx - 
pregnancy hx, G = gravida number of preg

==fetal heart rate tracings - we need to know these.== 
==top part - the baby , measured with doppler.== 
- ==big lines = 1 minute. small boxes = 6 seconds.== 
- ==y axis - the heart rate.== 
==bottom part - the contractions on the mom , external and internal monitors.== 
- external - just tells you the timing , nothing about the other things. 
- internal - we can tell how strong that is , uterine activity 
interpretation systematic approach: 
1. ==Baseline rate  - the baby tends to stay near this number on the y axis - this is the baseline?== 
2. ==Baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) variability - degree of fluctuation above or below the baseline... note that this is over time bc the fetus has to sleep too which impacts it.== 
	1. ==we want moderate variability the most - to make sure we dont have an acidotic baby! best indicator! squiggly line;== 
	2. ==minimal variability - like l*ess than 5 beats* variation around baseline. barbituates/prematurity/== 
	3. ==absent variability - like a flat line==
	4. ==marked variability - super rare, super squiggly, not good nor bad but needs more information.==
	note that the drugs like barbiturates and prematurity and arrhythmias and neurologic issues can all impact variabilities, causing less variability. 
3. ==Presence of accelerations- increase above baseline and come back down - **visually apparent, abrupt peak from baseline** - sign of good healthy babies.== 
	1. ==<32 weeks, expect 10 bpm , one box above the baseline for 10 seconds.== 
	2. ==32+ weeks, 15 bpm above the baseline. for like 15 seconds==
4. ==Periodic or episodic decelerations - VEAL CHOPS - look at the onset of the decelertion, how long it takes to hit the nadir/valley, and then the recovery to baseline.== 
	1. ==Variable - Cord compression, looks like a V! where the onset to nadir is less than 30 s, then recovery. or water broken early== 
	2. ==Early - *good*, from head compression and labor, onset starts before the peak of the contraction.== 
	3. ==Prolonged - **very bad**; emergency C section - looks like a plane crash - hr down to 60s and 80s, baseline basically completely crashed for a long time. greater than 2 min, less than 10 min== 
		1. greater than 2 min, less than 10 minutes. 
	4. ==Late - bad - *placental insufficiency* - this is like a *more gradual bad change*. - will be starting aftr the peak of contraction .== 
5. Changes or trends of FHR patterns over time 
6. Frequency and intensity of uterine contractions
recall - 160+ = tachycardia, <110 = bradycardia

reactive/nonreactive - in labor v not in labor
==three tiered FHR intrpretation system for being in labor.== 
==cat 1 is okay== 
- ==baseline rate 110-160 beats per min== 
- ==variability moderate==
- ==No late/variable decel,== 
- ==early decelerations can be here or not.== 
cat 2 - a limbo 
==cat 3 - very srs, absent baseline FHR variability== 
- ==recurrent late decel, variable decel, bradycardia==
- ==sinusoidal curves? = **fetal anemia, very strong! 3-6 cycles in 1 minute**==

labor - needs to be regular contractions + c**ervical change**
==stages of labor==
- ==first stage onset of labor to complete dilation 10. cm== - latent and active phase. 
	- ==6 cm dilated or more = active phase rapid cervical change==
	- latent phase - more and more pts will take gradual changes. 
		- ==only prolonged if it's 20+ hrs.== 
		- ==3 components to cervical exam? dilation, 2 fingers to feel how thick or thin it is = effacement. and station = head to the ischial spine of the mom.== 
		- dilation = what is ur finger? subjectiv, you need to measure how much your fingers are. 
		- ==effacement - feel length of the cervix on your fingers. lng = 0% effaced, then 50% is like 2 cm . very thin below that, so they've been laboring for a while.== 
		- ==fetal station== - feel the bony part of baby's skull, sweep out your fingers to find where the ischial spines are. ==0 = plane of ischial spines==. 
		- ==+3,2,1 are good, pushing it out.== 
fetal landmarks - we will feel that pubic bone = anterior with sacrum posterior. occiput = the back of their head. 
==occiput/back of head anterior = anterior at the pubic symphisis==
==occiput posterior - baby's looking up at the cieling. can deliver vaginally tho .== 
==rarer presentations - face presentations - we cannot get to their occiput bc they come out face first.== 
- ==so mentum / chin anterior can deliver but mentum posterior can't...== 

==protracted labor = 6 cm + and dilating less than 1 cm over 2 hrs. - we can make pitocin. and perform amniotomy - we also have oxytocin==
==arrest of dilation - rupture membranes, 6 hrs no cervical change with inadequate contractions and 4 hrs of no change with adequate contractions==
- we basically have to put an internal monitor on them to judge that though. 
- needs a c section. 

- ==2nd stage - complete dilation to fetal expulsion - passive phase - before mom is actively pushing. active phase - when mom pushes more==
	- no absolute time limit as long as progressing. 
	- ==nulliparous - allow new moms to push for 3 hours.== 
	- ==multiparous - allow mothers to push for 2 hrs==
	- ==add one more hr for epidural==
	- ==begin pitocin if no descent in first 60-90 min of pushing== 
	- operative delivery with vaccuum. 
- ==3rd stage - expulsion to placental expulsion - avg length 5-6 min, max is 30 min.== 
	- at 30 min, we worry about retained placenta = do either manual extraction or a DNC! we get to do this. put a clamp on the cord and then push down on the uterus. prevention of post-partum hemorrhage (really common tho)
	
PPP
power uterine activity, passenger - fetal size, position, presentation, pasage - maternal pelvis 
==cardinal movements.== 
==Engagement • Descent • Flexion of head, under pubic bone• Internal rotation - angle of head tries to face up into ceiling to fit thru • Extension - under the pubic bone• External rotation - head turns for shoulders • Expulsion==

pain management - nonpharm - with mvovement, amssage, hypnobirths, aromatherapy, etc. 
narcotics - early deliver morhpine etc. not later otherwise baby can come out with resp depression. 
- active labor = no narcotics. at that stage we have epidural = neuraxial anesthesia 
pts can do nitrous oxide (not common), but it's self administered. 

==ob triage pearls - 4 qs always ask== 
- ==contractions- how ofen, how strong== 
- ==vag bleeding - never normal in pregnancy== 
- ==leakage of fluid== 
- ==fetal movement- increased is not bad, but decreased is bad.== 
==common workups== 
- ==preeclampsia CBC, CMP, urine protein/cr ratio==
- ==rupture rule out - pool , ferning, nitrazine paper, swabbing their vagina==
- ==preterm labor - cervical exam. what makes labor contractions different than normal ones is that cervix will dilate.==
