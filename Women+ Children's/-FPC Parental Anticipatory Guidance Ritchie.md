-------
==toddlers = 1-3 yrs==
- ==15,18,30,36 months all well checks offered==
Healthy bodies
- avoid sugary drinks - j water + plain milk 
- ==**toddlers need actually less food bc they don't grow as fast! they can become picky/erratic eaters!** Just offer a selection! encourage sitting while eating/chewing==
- plenty of activity + free play 
- ==limit screens less than 1 hr "quality programming" like pbs kids, slow moving and stuff; avoid screen in bedroom== 
- ==sleep recs 1-3 yrs, 11-14 hours including naps==

- block stairs , lock doors(put lock up higher), plug covers on all unused electrical outlets, anchor furniture to walls. lock up meds, never leave them alone in vehicle. continue car seat rear facing 
	- ==keep a 5 point harness with the car seats.== 
poz parenting 
- ==read daily, work on naming obj/body parts, ask about the pictures too to work on sounds, colors, etc.== 
- pretend play, matching, sorting, simple puzles
- ==**allow independence w dressing/feeding; reward wanted behaviors MORE. use *brief timeouts from 1-3 yrs, no need for logical explainations***==
	unwanted behaviors naturally will decrease on its own with poz reinforcement 
==toilet training - exhibit readiness anytime from **18 mon - 3 yo**==
- ==at 18 months, they take off diaper on own - showing readiness first== 
- ==2.5 - 3 years of age most children are developmentally ready ; terrible 2s are when they don't necessarily wanna cooperate== 
- practical knowledge - ideally feet touch ground; so toddler potties are good. but squatty potty is okay. 
lead exposure - natural metal - traditionally think lead paint chips, ingesting contamination, breathing in lead dust
- ==low income households - "tell me what type of home you live in" - like housing built before *1978* ... "and do you know when it was built?"==
- kids younger than 6 = hand to mouth behavior 
- higher risk professions of battery manufacturing + older home renovation. dad who's a old home renovator can take off clothes before going home. 
- ==even low levels of lead - ***teardrop cells, basophilic stippling = all lead poisoning***==
	- ==tested at 12 + 24 months = test EVERYBODY== 
	- developmental delays + behavioral issues + learning difficulties 
	- 3.5 ug per deciliter = elevated. 4.5+ = call toxicology -> chelation therapy
