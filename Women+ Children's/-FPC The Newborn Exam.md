More important Newborn Vital Signs for Rotations
==Temp 36.5-37.9C==
==HR 120-160==
==rr 35-60==
==systolic bp 70-80== 
==diastolic bp 40-60== 
they'll have spikes right after they're born - remember we should take progressive values. 

Do not interrupt a feeding  
‣ Introduce yourself, ask when would be a reasonable time to return to  
examine the infant  
▸ Take a moment to observe  
‣ Consider the time since last feeding  
▸ Unbundle, but do not expose - keep the baby warm  
▸ When you pick baby up, support neck and spine

there's ob/peds team both - and so many people surrounding them - come back later 
if you find a dirty diaper you must change it 
==soothe - swadddle, say, shh, suck, (put on) side/but might stop this and put on back  = 5 s==

gen appearance - 
term babies - tight and toned 
preterm - floppy/flexible 
assess ease of breathing 
assessments - RR, tone of skin, skin, estimate gestational age
alert? fixing with eyes? responsive/neuro stuff? 

size and maturity - relative to sex/gstational age - always plot them on a growth chart 
AGA proportional for 10-90 percentile
==weight LGA >90% with infant of diabetic, beckwith-wiedemann syndrome, maternal obesity== 
==SGA <10% with placental infsuff, infections, chromosomes, syndrome, drug use== 

==Ballard Score - to put them on a date for gestational age; term tight/toned and premies floppy/flexible== 
- term babies tight/toned
- premies floppy/flexible 
- you have some Neuromusc manuevers and then physical structures to note - to corelate score w gestational age.

APGAR Score - more self explainatory 
==![[APGAR Score Algo.png]]==

feel for the sutures + fontanelles 
sutures - fibrous cartilage that hold together spots of kid's skull
![[Newborn Suture Fontanelle Position.png]]
==anterior fontanelle- diamond shaped, bigger, closes later==
==posterior - smaller, triangle shaped, closes 1-2 mon== 
note - if sutures override/fused, and then note if fontanelles are flat, sunken, bulging 

==common feat== 
- ==molding "conehead" when mom's laboring for a while, swelling in pelvis/scalp->pointed shape = all improves in next weeks== 
- ==caput succedaneum - diffuse swelling all over head = just fluid swelling, **will cross suture lines**==
- ==cephalohematoma - bump , collection of blood under periosteum, so **trapped in the bone and not crossing the suture lines**==
you must always measure head circumferance and plot it 

==CardioVasc Exam - we need to close foramen ovale + patent ductus arteriosus== 
- we don't want deox blood bypassing the lung ofc 
==central cyanosis - blue in mouth + central of body, lungs are crackly, resp distress, systolic murmur when we have cardio issues.== 
==hands and feet = blue = normal== 

INSPECT  
‣ Chest wall: pulsations, parasternal heave  
‣ Color: central cyanosis, mottling, peripheral (acro-) cyanosis  
look into RR, symmetric chest rise etc, accessory muscle use 
▸ AUSCULTATE  
‣ S1, S2, additional sounds   
‣ Rate  
‣ Rhythm  
‣ Murmurs (listen in between S1 and S2)  
‣ systolic vs. diastolic, early vs. late, character (harsh, vibratory etc)  
▸ PALPATE  
‣ Apical impulse, pulsations, thrill  
‣ Radial pulse  
‣ Brachio-femoral delay
breast buds normal 
==![[Newborn Cardio Pulse Points.png]]==

==neuro exam==
==on tummy - when prone they turtle and try to push themselves up,== 
should calm quickly with swaddle, recog parental voice 
tone - position @ rest normal tone v hypotonia central/peripheral with floppy baby 
- test with ventral position + at rest limb flex 

*A few reflexes unique to the newborn*  
==‣ Suck and Rooting  - root baby turns to stroking @ face side== 
==‣ Grasp – palmar & plantar - 1 finger in both places to grasp and pull up a bit== 
==‣ Moro (grab on to momma)- 4 months  - pretend to drop, they should lift arms== 
==‣ Babinski (toes upgoing)  - diff from adults, toes curl up with tickling at bottom feet== 
==‣ Fencer (tonic neck reflex)  - not in presentation== 
==‣ Back: trunk incurvation (Galant)  -  rub fingers on one side of trunk, body moves towards that side?==
==‣ Stepping - if you hold the baby up , they take some steps - just a reflex== 

face
- check eyes for red reflex, make sure it's symmetrical. both red in textbook but babies w darker skin has lighter ones. 
- ==subconjunctival hemorrhage - regular to have. but just note.== 
- ==eye drainage normal - clogging of tears, goopy appearance, every baby gets azithromycin drops to protect against infection is less likely== 
ears
- ==preauricular pits sometimes in ears, and abnormal tragus, all normal== 
==can have cleft lip/palate which close in weeks 6-7== 
- some do great and others have trouble w feeding 
==intraoral lesions== 
- ==epstein pearl can b in hard palate==
- ==natal teeth== 
==overly tight frenulum of tongue can affect feeding== 

arms/hands - check digits / color of limbs 
abdomen - look b4 ausculatation + palpation 
- ==palpate liver + spleen or maybe kidneys bimannual (not right after the meal)==
- ==normal **umbilical cord - 3 bvs, hardening of it, 7-10 days stump fall off **==
hip/leg/feet
- gently place back dysplasia with stretching ... otherwise we can get club feed
- toes count etc 
hip exams- checking 
- ortolani = pop out first, then barlow to pop back in ?? bringing legs back to midline from out 
- ==ortolani = reduces dislocated hip , feels it pop back in after barlow== 
- ==barlow feels hip pop out==

so if we catch the hip dysplasia we put them in a harness, fixes itself in a few weeks. if we miss it they'll need surgery 
leg creases - where buttock crease + thigh we need symmetry 

genital exam
- ==chordee - curve down of penis bc of firmness==
- ==hypospadias, look for rugae of testes (more = more mature ), descended, hydrocele==
- girls - majora/minora, hormonal changes like color, discharge etc. 

back/buttocks - dimples/pits seen , but if we can't see base, we image them. + look patency of anus

==normal skin findings== 
==vernix caseosa - waxy white coating they're born with - delayed back for 6 hrs for moisturization== 
==lanugo - more common w darker pigmented babies - fine hair== 
==dermal melanocytosis - common in back/upper arms, butt - **please document in exam bc it can look like bruising.**==
==acrocyanosis - blue limbs normal== 
==erythema toxicum neonatorum "e-tox" - little dots on a red base. can clear up and new ones pop up -== 
	==eosinophils seen under microscope!== 
==milia - white dots mostly on noses normal finding , pores on top of skin== 

**abnormal findings**
more common - resp distress - retractions accessory, nasal flaring 
![[resp distress differential.png]] 

FACE/Dysmorphism - look for fetal alc syndrome, low set ears etc nasal bridge 
things to note:
The Face and Dysmorphism  
▸ Eye  
‣ Shape and size, Slant,  
Epicanthal folds, cornea &  
pupil  
▸ Ears  
‣ Low-set, rotated, malformed  
▸ Nose & nasolabial folds  
‣ Nasal bridge  
▸ Mouth  
‣ Cleft, lip formation  
▸ Chin  
‣ recessed  
▸ Hairline & whorls
![[low set ear test.png]] ear not crossing midline 
abnormal : 
Body proportion  
▸ Chest  
‣ Symmetry, Wide-spaced nipples,  
pectus  
▸ Back  
‣ Scoliosis, dysraphism  
▸ Genitalia  
‣ Ambiguous, undescended testes  
▸ Hands and feet   - might have some extra fingers with a bigger base = surgery 
‣ Phalangeal deformities, spacing,  
palmar creases  
▸ Skin and hair  
‣ Birth marks, coloration, hair  
patterns

down syndrome - wide toes, one crease 
==signs of birth injury== 
==Petechiae, bruising, hemorrhage==  
==‣ Cephalohematoma== 
==‣ Subgaleal hemorrhage  - they can lose a lot of blood - does not cross suture lines, very superficial, see fluid wave with head movements== 
==▸ Fractures==  
	==‣ Clavicle, humerus  - some swelling here== 
==▸ Nerve damage  - erb's palsy - they have their hand flexed always== 
==‣ Brachial plexus, facial nerve palsy==  
==‣ Intracranial hemorrhage==
