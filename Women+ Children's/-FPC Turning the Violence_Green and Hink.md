getting something on community violence + youth violence - interdisiplinary and in all aspects
victims are disenfranchised, many unmet health needs before we even see them. help them recover. 

case 1 - aj , 
- denies depression, fight at school, suspended, occasional etoh abuse, marijuana use
- grandma household, 16 yo 
- 2 yrs later comes in with a gunshot wound 
- ppl in our teams, victims and people in law,  ppl who might not be in medicine, come in and talk to aj
- make sure the pt is stable. im xyz here's my role, what can i do for you right now? 
	- violence suppression + listening more to what happens. 
- support + empathy + anti-retaliation thing 
- community violence exposures. high risk of experiencing this again. we need to intervene. 
- connect to psychoologist, job placement, schools. get them a driver's lisence, services, crime compensation. 
- follow up happens for months - calling schools, calling law to follow up on investigation, calling mental health services 

implementation of public health approach and interventions can do great things ... like seatbelts for kids etc. 
many people do survive firearm assaults. they have trauma, chronic pain, dsability, functional loss, etc - so much impact for your community too. 
burden is seen hugely . leading cause of death for kids + teens in sc. firearms. 
lowcountry - highest homicides vs all of sc. 
homicides ages 0-12 - occurs at home, most involves adult perpetrator. and then there's multipel victims. 
teen - peer on peer + interpersonal violence. 
very different risk factors in teens vs children. 

homicides are often 
- young, male, black hispanic 
- previous assaults, witnessing violence
- urban areas
- prior ACEs, neglected psaces,ilegal firearm carring 
- poor social economic mobility + social capital , disaprities 
- "i carry a gun bc everyone else carries a gun" = fear factor in society makes things worse 
suicides - 
- older, 
- male white
- life stressors, military 
- med illness
- rural 
- recent suicides in community 

area deprivation index - income, edu, housing quality and employment - how vulnerable is it ? this is hugely the most accurate thing 
highest homicide rates are from the most area deprivation indexes. think about community context. 
understand all the risk factors
individual, interpersonal, organizational, community and policy 
we have a hospital violence intervention program here. 
- helps reuduce violence + improve outcomes 
- TTVIP - turning the tide violence intervention program 
	- what brought you in here
	- hoow can we help you recover
	- support your family 
	- suppress retaliation - help them do that 
	- retaliatory violence - among youth is super common 
	- what needs do you have? group violence? what were the circumstances 
	- use community + mental health services bc they dev ptsd. 
	- follow them in the community - getting kids back into school, helping them move, getting them transportation etc. 
who do we serve?
- other trauma centers are all around. high risk - older teens, young adults
- those people are often the most open to change. older people aren't able to most of the time. 
- 3 frontline client advocates to help... we need more people. 
- intensive services 12-30 yo helped. hard to go into georgetown, buford etc. so in the tricounty area. 

on-call team member, paging system , trauma pages + referrals. 
- how we identify patients integrating into the system. 
"what happened to you" instead of "what's wrong with you?" - trauma bay swarming is very very triggering - talk about trauma informed care 

we should invest in evidence informed community violence intervention programs
- hospital violence intervention programs
- community violence intervention 
- changing the landscape + building community - improving beauty will decrease crime bc makes people feel more safe.
