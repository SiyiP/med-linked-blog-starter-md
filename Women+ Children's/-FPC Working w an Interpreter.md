![[5. Working with an Interpreter_Khawaja_NOTES (1).pdf]]

limited eng proficiency LEP - limited ability to read,write, speak or understand - less than "very well" ... 22% speak lang other than eng @ home 
Span speakers inc by 30 million since 1980 

==National CLAS standards - interpreters should be offered at no cost==
notify of avaliability of lang assistance services in language both verrbally and in writing 
- **ensure competence of intrpreters + avoid use of untrained persons or minors as interpreters!!!**
==provide **print materials and signage in commonly used languages of area **==

significantly worse outcomes of preventative services bc the use of that is significantly decreased. worse outcomes -> higher usage of emergency services due to lack of primary care interpreters 

interpreters will interpret spoke/sign language. we have translation at musc sometimes too. 
==ad hoc interpreter - untrained - **use only if requested by pt or in emergencies**==
- more likely for errors, med term unfamiliarity, intimate/personal issues 
- sometimes they want their family member specifically to interpret. ad hoc is easier in some mean, but there's some consequences. 
- they're also not trained w/ HIPA etc, issues outside the visit. pt not providing all the information. 
==also many are undocumented - parents might speak spanish, child speaks eng. sometimes minors interpret for their parents. some laws forbid the use of minors as adhoc - the term "minor" is different in different states j lyk.== 

qualified interpreter -  interpret effectively, a ccu ra te ly, a n d i m p a r tially, b oth r e ce p tively a n d e xp r e s s i vely, us i ng a ny s p e ci a lized vo ca b u la r y r e q u i re d b y th e ci r cum stan ces.
- ==qualified interpreter - effective, accurate, impartial and both receptively and expressively able to use vocab. can cost less than a certified interpreter, no special cert, but better than ad hoc== 
==**certified interpreter -** fluent in 2+ lang, trained in professional standards/ethics, formal program for training in their role, courses on med term, oral+written boards.== 

MUSC - in person spanish 24/7 , ASL 8 AM-5PM
telephone 240 lang, 24 hr/day 
video remote interpretation 24/7 , multiple languages like ASL 
braille + audio reading download too 

I speak badge - assess fluency + level of comprehension of multilingual staff providing direct med pt care in top 5 lang of patients @ MUSC 
- **we cannot speak that language unless we pass the badge and get certified**

==we need to do better pre-visit - id need, allow **extra time**, huddle with interpreter!==
- ==**document name and ID of ad hoc or any interpreter** - give a bgd of patient w/ any useful anticipation-== 
	- im going in, this is a 5 yo well check, who's in the room 
	- or we're giving a bad diagnosis, i'm gonna allow a lot of silence, a lot of emotions, 
	- any useful anticipation or bgd on the patient! 
- **huddle interpreter** - **note that we need these appts to last LONGER! huddle with the team**

seat interpreter next to or slightly behind - a parrot on their shoulder 
speak directly, use first person, only say what you want interpreted. 
short sentences , one q at a time. 
sentence by sentence 
avoid idioms, acronyms, jargon, humor. 
- we cannot say stuff like "stomach bug", instead of just saying something else like gastric enteritis 
- we cannot use acronyms or whatevs - a good interpreter will interpret you exactly 
- you cannot use sarcasm, and you should ask about side stories to make sure they feel more connected - give the same care as you give anyone else. 

==After - use **teach back to assess patient comprehension**==
- ==**debrief ww interpreter to make corrections or clarify** : hey how did I do? anything I could work on or anything I needed to say?== 
decrease errors
- slow work to understand and verify . interpreters tell you they're gonna stop to have a convo to clarify 
- nonverbal cues - "you seem a bit worried, tell me more about what's your understanding of this."
- ==provider should **restate/summarize pt comments/history** after each step - HPI, dx, treatment plan discussion.== 
- ==or if you believe there's some interpreters not interpreting everything - **you can ask politely to interpret line by line**==
- sometimes many interpreters have much of med knowledge and know pts and families, sometimes having convos back and forth... it's cool to debrief and ask if they can interpret line by line personally with me, since my understanding is weaker.
