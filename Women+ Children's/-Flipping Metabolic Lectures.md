**PLEASE IGNORE G6PD DEFICIENCY IN THE NOTES PDF!  I AM TRYING TO HAVE THIS REMOVED. IT IS NOT TESTABLE FOR FLEX28!**
==nonclassical galactosemia - no GALK / glucokinase - *Cataracts*, failure to track objects or develop a social smile, increased risk of _E. coli_ sepsis==
==Classical galactosemia - Growth delays, *jaundice*, eventual cataracts, lethargy, *renal failure*, intellectual developmental delays, increased risk of _E. coli_ sepsis== 
(C) Type 3 GALE Deficiency (most rare)

glycogen storage disorders for Step 1 
Type 1 glycogen storage, von Gierke disease (Glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency) 
testable for block 7: ==**Type 2 glycogen storage disorder, Pompe disease (Lysosomal acid ⍺-1,4 glucosidase)**==
- ==treatment = IV administration of human acid-alpha-1,4-glucosidase; enzyme replacement therapy== 
- ==**glucose levels remain normal bc the metabolic defect affects glycogen degradation in LYSOSOMES, not the maintaining blood glucose levels in the cytoplasm.**==
Type 3, Cori disease (Debranching enzyme)
Type 4, Andersen disease (Branching enzyme)
Type 5, McArdle disease (Muscle glycogen phosphorylase)

==leigh syndrome can be impacted by - **pyruvate carboxylase** (autosomal recessive), **pyruvate dehydrogenase** (X-linked), and the **Fo subunit of ATP synthase** (mitochondrial inheritance) can all be mutated!!!==
- ==buildup of pyruvate -> lactate -> metabolic **acidosis, chronic lack of energy into tissues.** eventually leading to necrotizing brain lesions==
- necrotizing brain lesions. 
treat leighs syndrome with: 
==treat leighs with -High thiamine (PDH deficiency) and/or biotin supplementation (PC deficiency)==
==-High fat and low carbohydrate diet, ketogenic amino acids:leucine and lysine (want to *avoid glucogenic AAs to avoid further formation of lactate*)==
==to treat acidosis - Oral supplementation of sodium bicarbonate or citrate==
diet. -  Leucine and lysine are strictly ketogenic amino acids. They are not converted into glucose (via gluconeogenesis) and do not enter metabolism as pyruvate (thereby avoiding further build up of lactate!)

----
biotin cycle 
==biotin cycle: homocarboxylase synthase(made of 4 enzymes) adds free biotin to the apoforms of carboxylases .. and then freeing it once it's been degraded; B7 essential. any reduction or defect in holocarboxylate synthase results in metabolic acidosis== 
==biotin is freed from associated protein from diet -> and then activated with ATP to make biotinyl==  
- **holocarboxylase synthase a**dds it to the apocarboxylases , which are the 4 enzymes that take it - 
	- any reduction in this = metabolic acidosis 
- ==gluconeogenesis - pyruvate carboxylase, req biotin==
- ==lipid metabolism acetyl coA carboxylase req biotin== 
- ==amino acid catabolism 3-methylcrotonyl coa carboxylase req biotin== 
==at end of carboxylase cycle - will degrade the enzyme, only leaving biocytin, which is still bound to the spot.== 
==biocytin will be claved with biotinidse. - less common - very similar symptoms , metabolic acidosis== 
==deficiencies in biotin: Metabolic acidosis, lethargy, hypotonia, seizures, alopecia and dermatitis==

---
major site of ammonia clearance. = liver 

==**Hyperammonemia​:** hypotonia, poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting, troubled breathing, seizures; can lead to coma, irreversible brain damage and death +  **spasticity/spastic paraplegia**( specific to arginine buildup = NEUROTOXIN, *gait of patient is weird*)==
- ==arginase deficiency seen => no more arginine into ornithine which makes urea.== 
==treat: Sodium phenylacetate-sodium benzoate, low protein/arginine diet supplemented with essential amino acids, hemodialysis for hyperammonemia, liver transplant (LT)==

Which **_two_** compounds provide nitrogen to form urea throughout the urea cycle?- ==Carbamoyl phosphate + aspartate provide nitrogen to make urea== 

==argininosuccinase def - Hyperammonemia, so supplement with arginine to replenish ornithine==: hypotonia, poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting, spasticity, troubled breathing, seizures; can lead to coma, irreversible brain damage and death, supp with arginine to replinish ornithine 
- ==When there is a buildup of carbamoyl phosphate, it can diffuse out of the mitochondria and get utilized in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in the cytoplasm to form orotic acid==
- ==- Orotic aciduria can occur with both ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency and UMP synthase deficiency==

- ==Ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency: _hyper_ammonemia, _low_ BUN, and _no_ megaloblastic anemia==
- ==UMP Synthase deficiency: _no_ hyperammonemia, _normal_ BUN, megaloblastic anemia; UMP synthase gets rid of orotic acid?==
==![[urea cycle.png]]==

AA catabolism - note - alkapturia is not covered but you need to know for step
**Phenylalanine**
==Classic PKU - mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase. requires tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a cofactor. first step.== 
==Rarer PKU - when there's deficiency in dihydrobiopterin or mutation in dihydrobiopterin reductase. - more severe bc tetrahydrobiopterin is in other hydroxylation rxns. (tetrahydrobiopterin can't be regen.)==
- ==mousy/musky + *hypopigmentation*==
- ==treat: dietary supplementation with _tetrahydrobiopterin_==

**Tyrosine**
==Tyrosinemia I - defieciency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of tyrosine catabolism==
- ==accumulation of maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate can be converted to succinylacetone which can cause cellular damage to the liver and kidney==
- ==cabbage== like odor. 
- ==treat: Supplementation with nitisinone (NTBC; Orfadin)==
Alkaptonuria
**Branched Chain Amino Acids (Leu, Ile, Val)**
==Maple syrup urine disease - alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase - It requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor.==
- ==- Positive test: elevated leucine/isoleucine, valine==
- ==- Infants with maple syrup urine disease _cannot be breastfed_ and their levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine need to be carefully monitored (consider liver transplant)==

**Methionine** - 3 main stages , 
methionine cycle - convert to homocysteine
==transulfuration - homocysteine produced may condense with serine to form ⍺-ketobutyrate and cysteine==
==propionyl coA to succinyl coA-  ⍺-ketobutyrate is converted to propionyl CoA which then forms succinyl CoA==
Homocystinuria - Mutations in multiple enzymes of the methionine catabolism pathway lead to a builup of homocystiene
- ==osteoporosis, tall, kyphosis, lens subluxation, atherosclerosis.== 
1. ###   
    ==Cystathionine beta-synthase mutation that affects overall enzyme activity // treat with Decreased methionine intake and increased cysteine, vitamin B12, and folate(B9)== intake in the diet
2. ### ==Cystathionine beta-synthase mutation that specifically affects PLP cofactor binding /// Increased vitamin B6 in the diet==
3. ### ==Methionine synthase mutation (last step of methionine cycle) // Supplementation with trimethylglycine (folate-independent methylation of homocysteine) **OR** supplementation with methionine (do not do both at the same time);; **b12 and b9 deficiency can mimic this.**==
	1. trimethylglycine -  is able to methylate homocysteine to form methionine in folate independent manner 
4. ==### MTHFR mutation - - Methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase is essential for the regeneration of 5-methyl THF from 5,10-methylene THF, just treat by supplementing 5-methyl THF==
	1. - 5-methyl THF is the methyl donor for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine
	2. treat; 5-methyl THF supplementation
==![[odor s in AA catabolism.png]]==
==organic acid metabolism - defects in conversion of **propionyl coA to succinyl CoA**, metabolites of amino acid/fatty acid catabolism==
- Organic acids are intermediate metabolites of amino acid and fatty acid catabolism
- An organic acid disorder is caused by a deficiency in a specific enzyme necessary to this degradation process
- ==buildup causes - metabolic acidosis== 
- ==associated with the breakdown of isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and valine (IMTV) amino acids, as well as odd chain fatty acids, because these pathways all converge on **propionyl-CoA.**==
==propionic acidemia Due to lack of functional propionyl CoA carboxylase, AR inheritance==
- AR inheritance, poz = ==elevated levels of propionic acid and propionycarnitine in the blood, but with _normal_ biotin levels==
- ==Poor feeding, vomiting, dehydration, hypoglycemia, 2° hyperammonemia, hypotonia, lethargy, and seizures, long-term complications may include intellectual disability, coma, and death if untreated==
- ==treat with Low protein diet and carnitine supplementation==
==methylmalonic acidemia lack of functional methylmalonyl CoA epimerase or **methylmalonyl CoA mutase**, AR inheritance==
AR 
- _elevated_ levels of methylmalonic acid, methylmalonylcarnitine, propionic acid, and propionylcarnitine in the blood
- ==Vomiting, dehydration, hypotonia, lethargy, hypoglycemia, 2° hyperammonemia, *hepatomegaly* and *growth delay*s​, long-term complications may include feeding difficulty, *chronic kidney disease*, intellectual disability, pancreatitis, and death if untreated==
- ==treat: Low protein diet, carnitine, and **vitamin B12** supplementation==

newborn screening panel - peroxisomal + lysosomal dysfunction 
ignore - ADA-SCID - not testable. 
peroxisomes - small, membrane-enclosed organelles found in virtually all eukaryotic cells - catabolism of VLC fatty acids, D-amino acids, polyamines/reduction of ROS 
### ==A. Metabolism of very long-chain fatty acids (22+ C)→ X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy==
22+ carbons, catabolism into medium/short chain, then put into mitochondria 
- ==deficiency of ABCD1, a peroxisomal membrane transporter== of very long-chain fatty acids; X linked gene. 
- abnormal accumulation of ==VLCFAs in the brain, adrenal cortex, testes, and liver== and results in the clinical manifestations of this disorder
- - Positive test: increased C26:0 lysophosphatidylcholine
- ==Lorenzo's oil (mixture of long chain fatty acids), stem cell transplant, and gene therapy==
### ==B. Metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids → Refsum Disease==
Phentanoyl CoA hydroxylase catalyzes the initial hydroxylation reaction in the ⍺-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids to form formyl CoA and pristanic acid
- ==- **Deficiency of phytanoyl CoA hydroxylase leads to Refsum disease**==
- ==phytanic acid buildup in brain blood etc. Night blindness due to degeneration of the retina (retinitis pigmentosa), loss of the sense of smell (anosmia), cerebral degeneration, deafness, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, dry and scaly skin (ichthyosis)==
- treat: Avoid foods that contain phytanic acid (dairy products, beef, lamb, and fatty fish such as tuna and cod)
### ==C. Peroxisome biogenesis → Zellweger Spectrum Disorder==
- ==Mutations in the PEX genes that encode for proper formation or peroxisomes==
- increased C26:0 lysophosphatidylcholine
- treat symptoms only: ==cranial abnormalities, visual/hearing impair, dev delays, hypotonia, seizures, bleeding.== 
- AR

lysosomal storage!!! 
mucopolysaccharidoses - defect in breakdown of glucosaminglycans  / GAGs
- GAGs are generally associated with proteins found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix and carry a strong negative charge
- form proteoglycans; proteoglycans function to provide lubrication, structural support in connective tissues, adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, and binding to factors that mediate cell proliferation
- accumulation of heparan sulfate + dermartan sulfate seen in both. 
- ==hurler syndrome (M type 1 ) - autosomal recessive - Deficiency of ⍺-L-iduronidase==
	- ==Developmental _delay_, coarsened facial features, airway obstruction, corneal clouding, growth delay and hepatosplenomegaly==
	- Enzyme replacement therapy with ⍺-L-iduronidase
- ==hunter syndrome (M type 2) - x linked recessive, - Deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase==
	- ==*Not apparent at birth*, developmental _decline_, progressive loss of skills, change in facial features, hepatomegaly, distinctive *behavioral disturbances (aggressive behavior/hyperactivity)*, carpal tunnel syndrome, and *no corneal clouding*==
	- enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase

sphingolipidoses - defect in sphingolipid breakdown 

---
==newborn screening: FA beta ox disorders - all cause **hypoketotic hypoglycemia**==
carnitine shuttle system -  transports **long chain** fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix where β-oxidation occurs.
- going from CoA to carnitine 
==beta ox - produces 1.NADH and FADH2 in the oxidation reactions to be used in the electron transport chain (oxidation in OHOT) 2. Acetyl CoA for use in the TCA cycle==

most disorders are due to Carnitine shuttle: 
1. ==Primary Carnitine deficiency==   
     ==OCTN2 deficiency , which **brings carnitine into cells**,== 
     ==Cardiomyopathy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, poor feeding, lethargy, behavioral symptoms==
     treat: ==(how we treat all: ) Regular and frequent meals and snacks, diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat, L-carnitine supplements to help the body break down fats==

2. ==CPT-I deficiency - cells can't convert LC acyl coAs to acyl carnitines outside matrix== 
	==high free carinitine levels compared to C16 and C18 acylcarnitines== 
	==Poor appetite, hepatomegaly, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, elevated blood carnitine levels, hypotonia, lethargy, breathing problems, vomiting seizures, behavioral changes (signs often appear between 8-18 months, can be triggered by illness or fasting)==
	treat: Regular and frequent meals and snacks, diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil supplements to provide fats the body can break down

3. ==CPT-II deficiency==
    ==Cells cannot reconvert long chain acyl-carnitines to long chain acyl-CoAs inside the matrix.==
    3 forms are known for carnitine shutttle deficiency 
    ==3 forms - lethal neonatal, severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form, myopathic form (most common)==
     ==high levels of C16 and C18:1 acylcarnitines==
     ==In young children and newborn forms: cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, liver failure, and sudden death, hypotonia, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, lethargy, poor feeding, breathing problems, vomiting, seizures==
	==In myopathic form: may develop muscle pain and myoglobinuria after extended exercise, as well as hypoketotic hypoglycemia==
	treat - Regular/frequent meals and snacks, diet high in carbs and low in fat, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil supplements to provide fats the body can break down, L-carnitine supplements to help the body break down fats (in some cases)

4. ==Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency==
	==cells can't transport long chain acyl carnitines into matrix== 
    ==high lvls C16 and C18 acylcarnitines==
    ==In young children and newborn forms: hyperammonemia, heart problems, hypotonia, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, lethargy, poor feeding, breathing problems, vomiting, seizures, behavior changes, coma==
    treat - Regular/frequent meals and snacks, diet high in carbs and low in fat, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil supplements to provide fats the body can break down, L-carnitine supplements to help the body break down fats (in some cases)

==fatty acid b-ox - deficiencies in multiple acyl coA dehydrogenase family members have been found in LCAD, MCAD etc. MCAD most common== 
- ==MCAD - AR; cause SUID ; increased plasma octanoylcarnitine (C8 acylcarnitine)==
	- ==*well until decompensated* (i.e. *following an excessive period of fasting*/increased energy requirement), vomiting, lethargy, seizures, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and coma==
	- Regular and frequent meals and snacks, diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat, L-carnitine supplements to help the body break down fats

flipping metabolics session 
on med list - prednisone + prednisolone - 
-  ==steroids impair the function of insulin slightly==
glucose is high
why's lactate elevated. bc they just had a liver transplant, so it's been building up in the bloodstream 
urea cycle disorder. **high ammonia all thoughout their childhood**
arginine - neurotoxin, leads to gait in the patient. 
clinical suspicion for inborn error of metabolism 
==![[Inborn Metabolism Error Algo.png]]==

organic acidemias, from propionyl coa -> succinyl coa - we don't get succinyl coa, not feeding into gluconeogenesis . 
if you can't break down fatty acids, you build up a lot of dicarboxylic acids - and then we get acidosis. 
![[urea cycle.png]] - 

infant exercises
blood NH3 - nothing else = CPS-1 
==high citruline, but super high = arginosuccinase synthase - **we don't make the excretable argininosuccinate at all.**==
==high arginine - arginase== 
==high citrulline + argininosuccnase - smaller levels (really the argininosuccinate, which the citrulline can turn into, is **excretable, soluble and taken away from body!**)==
==high orotate = OTC== 

2. poor feeding, vomit, 2 mon old, pallor + jaundice, megaloblastic anemia, orotic acid in urine, normal ammonia 
	1. megaloblastic anemia - if we see 
	2. no OTC def bc normal ammonia 
	3. orotic aciduria - either OTC def or nucleotide metabolism 
3. 1 mon old male = hyperammonemia, mutation in CPS1 - low protein, hemodialysis annd 
	1. sodium benzoat + phenylbutyrate 
	2. all urea cycle disorders treated with these 2 drugs! 
4. 14 yo boy - sudden weakness on let side ... hospitalized for some cerebrovasc accident, downward partial dislocation of lenses of both eyes, for which he had a surg ; slight intellectual diability 
	1. homocysteinuria 
5. dislocation of both eyes lens, cleared but we found small infarc. waddling gait, and then decreased mineralization, high **methionine + homocysteine**
	1. high methionine, low cysteine 
	2. scoliosis + increased long bone growth 
	3. key characteristic - of mutation of 
	4. make sure to **differentiation homocystinuria + marfans!!! bc of lng etremities etc. howevr, homocystinuria have severe intellectual disabilities and seizures**
	5. cystathionine b-synthase deficiency is ultiamtely the answer. 
![[methionine catabolism.png]]
![[methionine pixorize.png]]
- defects in cobalamin manifest as MMA with homocystinuria bc methionine cycle + breakdown of methylmalonyl coa to succinyl coa both require B12. 
- any b12 def = we also see homocystinuria 

VOMIT = organic acid catabolism 
V - valine
O odd chain FA
M - methionine 
I isoleusine 
T - threonine 
==secondary hyperammonemia can happen with organic acidemia - bc it's acidic environment, and **enzymes of urea cycle function best in a basic one.**==

4 day old male - vomitting + lethargy - healthy @ birth, ffeeding deterioation 
sweet odor urine, afebrile - hypotonia/hypertonia? ketone bodies + keto aicds. 
maple syrup

1 yo concerns with development - not hitting the developmental milestones - mousy odor 
pku - hypotonia + microcephaly, hypopigmentation bc can't make melanin 
- can't make catecholamines if we don't have tetrahydrobiopterin 

6 mon old infant presents w dev delay, hypotonia, seizures - freq episodes vomiting + rash. metabolic acidosis, elevated org acids, reduced fa prod 
- most likely a biotinidase - biotin cycle - will basically just be freeing and adding. 
- **multiple carboxylase deficiency!!!! = biotinidase think of it**

==![[biotin cycle.png]]==

2 wk old, no longer feeding regularly and lethargic - low blood glucose + no ketones. low carnitine + acyl carnitines. 
- ==primary carnitine deficiency - deficiency in transporter that'll get the carnitine in n the first place.== 
	- ==can't transport free carnitine to the cytoplasm , l**ow carnitine bc it goes into the urine.**== 
- know from the stem it'll be fa ox - low blood glucose + no ketones - ==**if you can't make ketones w low blood glucose, it means we have FA ox def**==


no biotin cycle down there.
