note - Risk for chromosome abnormalities ~ 1 in 150 live births - spontaneous abortions higher if offspring has chromosomal aberration 
euploid - multiple of the base haploid - normal number 
haploid - one set 
diploid - 2 sets 2n 
polyploid - 2+ whole sets of chromosomes , 2-3 % pregnancies. most result in spontaneous abortions/stillbirths
- ==triploidy 3n 69 chromosomes==
	- ==dyspermy / diandry - extra from paternal origin, 2 spermatozoa, most common cause==
		- ==**partial hydatidiform mole, large placenta + hydropic changes, bundle of grapes**==
	- ==dygyny - extra from maternal, diploid ovum fertilized, small placenta, no hydropic changes==
- ==tetraploidy 4n - 4 chromosome sets, 92 chromosomes== 
	- ==doubling of normal 46== 
	- ==failure of zygote to complete first division, post-zygotic, post-fertilization== 
aneuploidy - change of number within a set. NOT an exact multiple - **most common cause is nondisjunction from MATERNAL MEIOSIS I**
- monosomy - 2n-1 , missing 1 copy, turners 45,x
- trisomy 2n+1, extra copy of a particular chromosome like +21 
- nullisomy - missing both copies, 44,XX, -7,-7 
meiosis I - homologues remain attached via chiasmata... and then cohesions hold sisters until separation. 
- ==failure to separate homologues in *meiosis one*! - **will always result in aneuploid offspring, all 3 chromosomes are unique!**==
meiosis II - cohesions used to attach sisters, then released as sister hromatids move to poles.
- ==failure to separate sisters in *meiosis two*, **half offspring will be aneuploid while other half is euploid, and extra chromosome will be identical bc sister chromatids are!**==

==mosaicism - 2 or more cell lines in a single zygote - **post fertilization, more mild phenotype** - one euploid and one aneuploid cell line.== 
- ==46, XY [16]/ 47, XXY[4] = means that 4 cells have XXY while the other 16 cells are euploid==

aneuploidies that are viable 13, 18, 21, X and Y
==trisomy 21 - **Congenital heart defects (AV canal), unique from the other heart defects** Single palmar crease Wide sandal gap Short, broad hands and feet== 
Atlanto-occipital instability Intellectual disability 
==GI anomalies (Hirschsprung, duodenal atresia)== 
**Autoimmune** (thyroid, celiac) 
==**Brushfield spots in eye**,**small white, gray/brown or yellow spots in a circular arrangement on the edges of the iris, the colored part of the eye** ==
==**Hypotonia Risk for leukemia and Alzheimers**==
Flattened face • Flattened occiput • Epicanthal fold • ==**Up slanting palpebral fissures==** • Small mouth with prominent tongue • Short, upturned nose • Small, posterior-rotated ears • **Short neck with excess nuchal skin**

95% nondisjunction during meiosis I - majority are maternal 
major risk factor 30+ maternal age. 
recurrence risk: De novo nondisjunction event: 1% or age related risk
Exception: Translocation 21:21 • De novo is still <1% • If inherited from a parent recurrence is 100%

==Patau syndrome trisomy 13- Cleft lip, palate Holoproscencephaly, microcephaly Micropthalmia Cardiac defects **(ASD/VSD)** Post-axial polydactyly Cutis aplasia Renal/GU abnormalities Omphalocele Intellectual Disability==
- ==midbrain defects(in brain and in hands with polydactyly), cardiac defects, GU abnormalities== 
80% nondisjunction during maternal meiosis
>90% die within the first year of life
recurrence - 1% de novo, 
	Exception: Translocation 13:13 • De novo is still <1% • If inherited from a parent recurrence is 100%

==trisomy 18, edwards syndrome - overall small, hand and feet abnormalities== 
==Cardiac defects (ASD/VSD)==
==**Rocker bottom feet**== 
==**Overriding fingers (2 over 3, 5 over 4)**== 
Microcephaly, prominent occiput, small jaw
==, micrognathia Intrauterine growth restriction (prenatal growth failure) - very small== 
==Short sternum Feeding difficulties, failure to thrive GU abnormalities Severe intellectual Disability Low subcutaneous fat, underdeveloped muscles==
80-95% maternal nondisunction
- lethal; 90% die within first year of life. 
de novo 1% age related risk, but less applicable , balanced transocation. 

sex chromosome aneuploidies - less severe bc they have less genetic information
- ==X-inactivation in females - sometimes they can get turned on and off, protective==
- low gene content are in the y chromosome
- ==most not recongnized until puberty except turner's==  
- all cells v. mosaic too 
pregnant women - look at all the most common aneuploidies - just looking at the common chomosomes, now picking up the x/y 
==turner's -== 
- Webbed neck 
- ==**Cardiac defects (bicuspid, aortic valve stenosis, or coarctation) unique**== 
- ==Widely spaced nipples (shield chest) , **Horseshoe kidney / kidney defects**== 
- Streak ovaries / ovarian dysgenesis - infertility 
- ==Lymphedema of hands and feet at birth, Short stature ; babies born swollen.== 
- ==**Risk of gonadoblastoma in 45X/46XY mosaic subtype** ; was a male karyotype who lost a y and has an x. hidden gonads higher in their pelvis , some testes are stuck and hidden there.== 
	- testes - can have cancer - gonadoblastoma. 
- Normal intelligence Increased elbow carrying angle, small petite, etc but normal classrooms
only 1% result in live births. 20% of all first trimester losses. 50% are like 45x, or can be isochromosome xq, deletion or mosaic. 
- ==marker and ring chromosomes seen in mosaics. - extra blebs;. or rings of chromosomes stuck together in the circle, can break and stuff. can be associated with it== 

XXY, klinefelter - mixed picture
- ==klinefelter - Infertility Hypogonadism (less testosterone) - typically presents male== 
- Gynecomastia With increased risk for breast cancer Motor and speech delays Behavior issues Hypotonia Tall,
- ==long limbs “Marfanoid habitus” Sparse facial, axillary, pubic and/or body hair Feminine distribution of adipose tissue==
- some speech delay, motor/behavioral issues, etc. 
female distrib of fat. 
==non-disunction in meiosis I, **50% are paternal and 50% maternal**==

X inactivation lecture - recall the skewed x activation etc. oct. 9th lecture. 
strutural abnormalities happen de novo or familial 
include; translocations, inversions, del, dup
- you need to do a karyotype on the prob and and then the parents too.- are they gonna pass it on again? 
==rearrangements are in 1/375 newborns, veryyy common - Result from chromosome breakage, recombination, or exchange, followed by reconstitution in an abnormal combination==
- ==balanced vs unbalanced AKA reciprocal v non reciprocal== 
- we barely use FISH in genetics, only microarray + karyotype. 
==balanced - all genetic material stays present, just switched up a bit, i**ncreased risk for abnormal offspring** but **normal phenotype, 1/500 ppl**==
==unbalanced. - either gain/loss of material, abnormal phenotype, 1/1600 live births== 

translocations - exchange of chromosome segments between 2 chromosomes
- ==reciprocal - flip floping chomosomes. from breaking or recomb involving nonhomologues.== 
	-  Risk for unbalanced gametes and abnormal progeny due to malsegregation during gametogenesis
	- ==meiosis I - **malsegregation of chromosomes; so instead of a bivalent pattern, we make a quadrivalent pattern, like a cross to make sure it splits appropriately**==
		- depending on how this CROSS segregates, we have the corners end up togehter, and then the other corneris end up together = balanced. 
- ==non-reciprocal - one's giving the other's not== 
	- ==happens in that cross as well , but adjacent segregation instead of alternate.== 
reminder of normal meiosis I - bivalent pairs form during prophase I .... lining up in 2s. 4 sister chromatisd stacked up upon another. obvi crossing over occurs. 

==![[segregation adjacent+alternate.png]]==

when you have that translocation, we call the resultant ones "derivatives"- a balanced translocation is not dangerous but when they make these gametes they'll have some risk. some ppl wit lots of miscarriages have tehse. 

==robertsonian translocation - **2 acrocentric chromosomes fusing near the centromere, loss of the short arm or the P (petite) arm.** - ends up with 45 chromosome, like maybe 13 and 14 are stuck togheter.== 
- normal phenotype, risk of abnormal offspring. 
- ==acrocentric - 13,14, 15,21,22 -== 
==![[robertsonian translocation.png]]==
an example - 5% of down syndrome pts have 46 chromosomes, one of which is a robertsonian translocation (most commonly between 21 and 14/22)
- ==note - **carriers of robertsonian translocations involving 21 are at risk for making a child w translocation down syndrome**==
- alternate segregations from quadrivalent - w'ell get a balanced and one normal. 
- in any adjacent I we get trisomy 21s, and monosomy 21 lethal. 
- adjacent segregation II are very lethal; trismoy 14 and monosomy 14 are incompatible with life.
if parents have 3+ misarriages, get a karyotype to make sure they don't have a translcation. 

==inversions - when single chromosome gets thru 2 breaks and then put back into the segment inverted. ***not an issue for the individual, but at risk for abnormal gametes***==
	- inversions - actually make a loop! they try to make a loop to make sure that we line up perfectly. there's some chromosomes that are normal, and in between are those that are crossed over. 
	- in both inversions **half of the gametes are fine, other half are inverted**
- ==paracentric - both breaks happen in one arm - para = beside the centromere;; a-centric, absent.== 
	- inviable 1/2 of them, bc you have been left with acentric (no centromeres) and dicentric (2 centromeres) ==we have 1/2 fine balanced, and 1/2 dead==. 
- ==pericentric - breaks happen in each arm, peri = around the centromere. inclusive of the centromere, in the inversion.== 
	- centromeres included, ==unbalanced gametes with both duplication and deficiency of chromsome segments distal to inversion== 
	- double As, no D, Double Ds, no A with unbalanced. basically duplication and deletion on the effected ones, and balanced on the other. 
==we worry more about pericentric inversions - **bc they can have a kid with a del or duplication**==
==paracentric - pretty common on karyotypes , a bit more trouble getting pregnant bc of the inviable gametes but have normal children overall.== 

del - loss of segment, imbalance is the result
- ==monosomic or haploinsufficient deletion - missing some material==
- depends on size of genes + number of it, like the critical regions 
- ==microdeletions - less than 5 mb, detected on microarray vs large cytogenetically visible deletions.== 
terminal del - at the end of the chromosomes. 
==interstitial del - in the middle. closer to centromere "more proximal"==
==rings happen bc of deletions at both ends, which the cut non deleted sides would glue together as a circle== 

==cri du chat syndrome - **terminal del of 5p** - detect on karyotype or microarray - cry of the cat - characteristic cat.== 
- 5p monosomy - ==high pitched cat like cry , micrcephaly, hypertelorism (wideset eyes)==
- intelectual disability, hypotonia. =="round moon face=="

==4p terminal del - wolf-hirschhorn syndrome - on karyotype or microarray - 4 letters in wolf so 4.== 
- ==greek warrior helmet appearance. **broad forehead, then a line straight into the nose, no suncken in nasal bridge**==
- ==cardiac defects, hypotonia,== 
- ==seizures==
- failure to thrive
- ==intellect disability, cleft lip + palate.== 

digeorge 22q11.2 del syndrome 
- interstitial microdelection - on microarray 
- cardiac defcts, abnormal faces(bulbous tip nose, low set ears), thymic hypoplasia immunodeficiency , clft palate. and **hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia** 
- CATCH-22
- anything after the p/q make sure to break down the numbers. not 22 q eleven 

==williams syndrome - interstitial microdelection 7q11.23==
- ==happy outgoing, elfin like face== 
- ==cardiac defects (supravalvular aortic *stenosis*)== 
- ==infantile **hypercalcemia**==
- mild to mod intellectual disability
- ==stellate iris pattern. - instead of the brushfield spots of trisomy 21, we get light rings around the eye.== 

duplications - just know this happens at loci that contain tandom/inverted repeats mainly 
less detrimental than deletions. may small dupes don't have any clinical significance
