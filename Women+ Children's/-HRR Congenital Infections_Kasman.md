congenital infection - vertically transmitted from mom to fetus/neonate during pregnancy, childbirth, or via breast milk 
- subset - ==perinatal transmission - directly from mom to kid between 22nd wk gestation and 1 wk post-birth== 
Vertical transmission types: 
Prepartum or transplacental
Intrapartum (during delivery) - vaginal secretion, blood or sometimes during c section
Postpartum via breastfeeding

==1# factor of adverse outcome. = Mother is experiencing infection with the pathogen for the first time during the pregnancy - **no prior immunity built up, no antibodies transplacentally, pathogen number is higher**==
2nd factor = timing of exposure - due to tropisms
- transplacental - developmental stage of tissue @ time of infection affects outcome , similar to critical malformations ranges 
- ==perinatally, maternal infections late in pregnancy = worse outcomes.== 

==congenital infections w/ greatest risk in first trimester = **all attacks the CNS, which is what's forming at this time.** - all can lead to fetal + perinatal death, perm dev defects== 
- ==CMV - sometimes no illness @ birth but only post-natal consequences(deafness) developped among months - years, lifelong, reactivation== 
	- a herpes virus, lifelong, reactivates, some uncertainty 
	- most common intrauterine infection, ==90+% are asymptomatic @ birth, see hep, rash, retinitis + calcifications if symptomatic.==
	- dx = PCR of saliva or urine in 1st 3 wks. or anti CMV IgM
	- ==treat = valaganciclovir if symptomatic but no significant diff in long term ; no prevention== 
- ==rubella - eradicated from USA - # 1 cause of congenital deaf blindness world wide; follows rubella in 1st trimester== 
	- ==blueberry muffin spots, low birth weight, pneumonitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, hepatosplenomegaly==  [[-SFP Pregnancy and Plancenta_Butler]]
	- permanently - ocular+cardiac defects, microcephaly + deafness
	- ==triad: cataracts, deafness, heart defects!==
	- ==prevent with just one shot== 
- ==toxoplasma gondii - sometimes no illness @ birth but only post-natal consequences==
	- from cats! 
	- ==triad - chorioretinitis(inflammation of choroid + retina), intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus (water on brain, excess CSF)==
	- or asymptomatic @ birth but later learning/visual disabilities 
	- ==avoid exposures during pregnancy (undercooked meat which can have cysts, soil/litter), and pre-existing immunity from mom. anti-toxoplasma drugs too== 
	- ==transplacental transmission happens - **in any time, but greatest severity during first trimester**==
- ==zika virus - flavivirus by mosquitos / semen==
	- ==microcephaly, brain dmg, blindness, seizures, swallowing difficulties, worsen post-birth== 
	- mosquito control + avoiding conception durig mosquito season. 
	- no treatment ) : 
	- too early to know full range of potential health issues ): no reports of breastfeeding, no evidence that it'll infect future pregnancies. 

---
==greatest risk in 2nd + 3rd trimester; quite diverse.== 
- ==hep C - mom to kid late pregnancy to during birthing process== 
	- ==co infection with HIV doubles the risk== 
	- no association with viral genotype, mode of delivery, breastfeeding 
	- ==no symptoms!== 
	- ==prevent with treating mom , dx : antibody at 12 month of age, follow up poz with RT-PCR, and then consider treatment at 3 yrs.== 
	- ==up to 30% spontaneously clear it by 3 yo.== 
- ==listeria monocytogenes - preg women 10x more likely to get it ! lunch meats etc.== 
	- ==miscarriage/stillbirth, srs or fatal infections== 
	- ==prevent - avoid unpasturized dairy / deli meats, may be treatable w antibiotic== 
	- dx - culture blood, csf, amniotic fluid 
	- ==can be treated with CSF or treating the mom== 
- ==parvovirus B19 - single stranded DNA, very hardy in environment==
	- ==highest risk 1/2  bc *placental p antigen* is hightest but most risk in later !!!==
	- tropism of hematopoetic cells -> ==fetal severe anemia, cardiac failure + hydrops fetalis== 
	- ==viral myocarditis== 
- ==treponema pallidum - congenital syphilis== 
	- ==on the rise, stillbirth, premie or clinical. only severe cases = clinically apparent at birth== 
	- early congen syphilis - ==thick pale placenta, rhinitis/snuffles, hepatomegaly + macupapular rash 2-3 wks post birth== 
	- ==treat mom w penicillin G ASAP in pregnancy as possible== 
	- ==high chance of vertical transmission if primary syphillis or secondary. less and less as time goes on.== 
		- ==note - early / latent (no symptoms) - will decrease in time after year 1== 
	- risk of vertical transmisison up **later on in gestation, highest in last 4 months**- treat anytime be4 that it'll be prevented 
- ==HIV - poor weight gain + same opportunistic infections in adults==
	- same dx as for adults PCR / p24 antigen test 
	- ==25% transmission no intervention and <1 with any treatments or C section by 38 wks or no breastfeeding/ ARV== 
---
==risk during birth / perinatal period== 
- ==Group B strep , HSV - fulminant fatal infections== 
	- grp b strep - ==3rd trimester stillbirths, neonatal survivor infections... up to 40% pregnant women colonized + without disease==
		- result of GBS ==ascending from vagina into amniotic fluid after labor onset / rupture of membranes.== 
		- ==prevent w/ intrapartum IV antibiotics==
	- ==HSV and VSV - severe skin lesions, systemic infections, very common but now less bc of vaccinations.== 
		- mostly when we get primary infection while giving birth 
		- ==maternal Ab provide protection in established infections. C section only when visible lesions.== 
		- ==acyclovir reduces mortality but many survivors have perm brain dmg ):== 
- ==hep B , HIV - chronic initially asymptomatic that are lifetime== 
	- ==hep b - asymptomatic @ birth, but high risk of chronic HBV infection without treatment, so **lifetime risk of hepatocellular carcinoma** ;== 
	- prevention to vaccination mom, then baby
	- ==tenofovir - give to mom with high viral loads(Hep E antigen marker) in 3rd trimester.== 
	- ==note - no c section bc blood exposure.== 
- ==N. gonorrhoae , C. trachomatis, HPV - symptomatic eyes + resp track infections, or longer in case of HPV== 
	- ==gonorrhea - routine erythromycin ointment in each eye at birth to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum== 
		- ==can disseminate to which you treat with ceftriaxone.== 
		- prevention via screening + treating pregnancies 
	- ==chlamydia trachomatis - D-K in STD==
		- ==show with conjunctivitis + pneumonia ; asymptomatic til 5-14 days post delivery== 
		- test, treat + test again in 3rd trimester
		- ==need systemic antibiotics, azithromycin single dose.== 
		- if we get systemic - 4 wks or later, peripheral eosinophilia with normal WBC 
	- ==HPV - asymptomatic @ birth, then 2-5 they get hoarseness by recurrent resp papillomatosis== 
		- ==benign laryngeal tumor in kids, rarely spreads into lungs and malignant transformation if 16 and 18 types. ablation is huge.== 
		- ==HPV 6 + 11 most common== 
		- ==regresses in puberty== 
		- risk factors - ==mom under 20 with condyloma acuminata ; prevent with gardasil 9 vaccine on mom== 
TORCH infections - old mneumonic for congenital infections but not helpful 

practice Qs
1. B
2. A
3. VDRL - nonspecific syphilis test **good measure of active infection though!**, and then anti-treponemal antibody test performed at 32 wk gestation is poz. you've been infected before but now cured. B. recall we don't get lifelong immunity to syphilis
