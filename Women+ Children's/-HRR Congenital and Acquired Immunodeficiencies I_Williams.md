![[3. Congenital and Acquired Immunodeficiencies I and II_Williams_NOTES (1).pdf]]
innate immune  -rapid resp, first line, 
- macrophage, natural killers, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils
adaptive - b cells-> antibodies, t cells cd4 helpers and cd8 killers
both - t cells + natural killer t cells 

immune deficiencies can impact any part of the immune system - any will cause disregulation 
- antibody defects
- cellular immune problems - effector t cells impacted
- ==combined immune deficiency - t and b cell problem== 
- ==phagocytic disorders - mostly with neutrophils== 
- complement defects too 

primary = congenital ;; and secondary = acquired. now we have congenital v acquired. 
bad ones are mainly congenital - genetic monogenic defects = causes increased infection
- 1 in 700 , common, vary from mild to life threatening. infections happen in childhood, dx when later. 
secondary - with malnutrition, radiation/chemo, cancers bone marrow metastasis, drugs, infection of leukocytes, splenectomy 

inborn error of immunity - IEI - a group of rare, inborn disorders of the immune system that result from:  Absent or reduced **number** of immune cells  Absent or reduced **function** of immune cells
inc risk for recurrent/severe infections... 
inc risk for autoimmunity, lymphoprolififeration (too many cells cause cancer or big spleen), or hyperinflamamtion (massive hyperinflammatory response when immune triggered)
MISA - from adults - attack organs post virus. 

==**First aid book - CVID isn’t x linked, JOB is dominant + C1 is dominant**==

general manifestations of B cell, t cell and innate imunodeficiencies - ==B Cells - usually small lymph nodes, and small antibodies - recurrent sinopulmonary infections==
==T cells - more of bacterial and viral infections - fungal + intracellular infections like mycobacterial. - some cancers associated too== 
==innate immune deficiencies - ppl would get huge absesses and severe bacterial infections.== 
==![[summary b,t and innate immune def.png]]==

![[pathogen susceptibility IEI.png]]
usually everythign given is helpful for clues to immune defect

these are rare - 2:1 male to female ratios. bc some of these conditions are x linked
B cell syndromes - 
- ==Agammaglobulinemia - x linked agammaglobulinemia - defect in bruton's tyrosine kinase Btk==
	- btk essential for ==signal transductionin pro-b cell to mature pre-bcell. stall in maturation==
	- ==no lymph nodes, no b cells in blood, no antibodies==
	- normal t + NK cells, very low antibodies. 
		==phenotype - sinopulm  infections - S. pneumo, S. pyogenes, S. aureus, Hib)==
		==will get diarrhea from giardia, meningoencephalitis, small or no tonsils, more autoimmune disorders== (unclear why!)
		treat with **immunoglobulin therapy weekly or monthly**
- Selective lg isotype deficiencies - IgA deficiency , most common in 1/700 ppl (many have no clinical manifestations)
	- ==selective IgA isotype deficiency - gene defect varies but **IgA heavy chain genes are norma**l== 
	- ==moa - block in differentiation of B cells -> IgA secreting **plasma cells**==
	- phenotype - clinically can be normal but ==**increase suseptibility to resp/GI infections**==
	- or ==allergic rxn to the igA poz blood transfusions== + increased risk of autoimmune conditions  
		- undetectabile igA <7 - more suseptibility for the allergic blood rxn + autoimmunity
		- check their igA level to see if they can actually receive blood if they keep reacting to it 
- ==selective IgG deficiency - most common igG def = IgG3 in adults==
	- very low igG levels; ==they're fine until they're not fine in adults years. gene defect varies but Ig gamma C genes are almost always normal.== 
- ==common variable immunodeficiency - have to have **igG AND another antibody** - common = more than one.== 
	- heterogenous, but ==include intrinsic B cell defects, deficient t cell help, excesive T regs==
	- ==tend to be more sick than the others==
	- same types of infections as everyone though. 
specific antibody deficiency - ==**normal amounts of all antibodies, but just impaired function, antibodies can't remember stuff too good**==
---
t cell syndromes
==DiGeorge syndrome - microdeletion 22q11.2 TBX1 gene encoding t box 1 transcription factor== 
- basically ==hypoplasia or absence of the thymus + parathyroid glands.== 
- TBX1 = T = thymus, B = bone marrow , clipped. 
- ==over time, you'll know. narrow chin, low set years, etc; tetralogy of fallot, ventral septal defect, interrupted aor arch. cleft palate, increased autoimmune risk + aDHD + psych conditions==
- low or absent T cells - **abnormal thymic development**, but antibodies normal 
- ==increase susceptibility to **mycobacteria, fungi, viruses**==
CATCH-22 [[-HRR Chromosomal Abnormalities I+II Lancaster+Thompson]]
==recall - thymic hypoplasia -> hypocalcemia -> **neonatal seizure or tetany**==

==TCR expression/signalling defect - in the actual receptor + signalling - a funcitonal issue==
- ==CD3 subunits , ZAP70== 
- they **have ==chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis STAT1 losss of function defect== - CANDIDA susceptibility like warts or plaques**
- normal or elevated blood lymphocytes level, **==decreased IL2, IL2R, IFN gamma production==.** 

==IL-12 / IL-12R deficiency -== 
- ==we see mycobacterial infections - terrible fungal dz or intracellular bacterial infections, like there's growths under your skin about to pop!== 
- autosomal recessive mutations in ligand/receptor genes
- ==decreased Th1 responses, low IFN-gamma + TNF production==
- ==**fever unexpectedly reduced or absent==**![[activated APC lines.png]]
IL 12 functions - IFN gamma pathway - we have a huge role in b cells, t cells, etc etc. it affects it all pretty much from activated APC
---
combined b/t cell syndromes - looks pretty bad 
==SCID = severe combined immunodeficiency - clinically worse case scenario -== 
==hematopoietic stem cell transplantation - earlier the better can cure... and ADA-SCID starts enzyme replacement then ideally gene therapy. all should get immunoglobulin replacement, prophylactic antibiotics, and antifungal.== 
- in infancy classically 
- ==small, chronic diarrhea, recurrent thrush on tongue, fungal diaper rashes==
- ==horrible severe/opportunitistic infections, vaccine associated dz==
- t cells too low + b cells might be nonfunctional (b cells are still there, but **bc not enough t cells to help them remember things, b cells aren't useful.**)
- ==completely normal until infected + critically ill - fatal before age 1== 
	- a lot of genes are involved, but ==X linked is most common 50% here==. 
	also ==more recessive forms, complete Digeorge syndrome - **no thymus = inability to make t cells, that is under the umbrella as SCIDs**==
	- 2nd most common - ==ADA sCID - adenoosine deaminase - **not able to make ANY lymphocytes, so no t, b, and no NK cells.** buildup of the metabolites of purine dATP, inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, harming rapidly dividing cells==
==x linked scid - boy in the bubble, - genetic defect - absent **common cytokine receptor gamma-c chain** - basically on that receptor, IL-7/2/4/9/15 signals are not receive, so few t cells begin maturation. no ability to make NK/T cells earlier in the process== 
- low t, normal/increased b, low serum ig, low NK 

ADA - autosomal recessive scid adenosine deaminase - buildup of metabolites of purine synthesis dATP which **inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, harming rapidly dividing cells from no regulation of dna synthesis rate**
- we get massive cell death at the lymphoid progenitor cell stage - no t,b , nk 
**both PNP and ADA treated with enzyme replacement**
PNP - purine nuleoside phosphorylase, same as ADA, but the block is at a different step. 
- buildup of deoxyribose inosine , next step from ADA. 

normal bone marrow - hematopoesis 
x-linked scid - basically common gamma chain no ability to make NK/T cells
earlier in the process - ADA/PNP scid = all lymphocytes are absent.
- note everything in the bone marrow seems normally 

==combined syndrome: reticular dysgenesis - ak2 mitochondrial==
- ==myeloid levels - lymphoid stem cells.== 
- ==**most severe form of SCID, even more uphill no t/b/granulocytes gone, death in early infancy**==

==Job's syndrome - Hyper IgE Syndrome - HIES -== 
==**autosomal dominant STAT3 loss of function**==
- basically ==high IgE, but low IFN gamma, low Th17(fungal infections on nails)==, we get phagocytic defects as well
- ==eczema, cold staph abscesses, recurrent sinopulm infections - triad.== 
- ==connective tissue abnormalities - scoliosis , poor wound healing, coarse face, bulbous nose==
	- they can get pneumatic seals in lungs, bad pneumonia can lead a hole in their lugns that can get infected. 
==hyper x linked IgM syndrome==
- ==CD40L will cause it, the lack of it on T helpers -> defective t cell help for b cell + macrophage activation== 
- phenotype - normal b/t numbers, but severe deficiency of cell mediated immunity against intracellular microbes
	- ==**no isotype switching so that igM is major serum antibody**==

==wiskott-aldrich - x linked recessive in WAS gene, igM low, igA + IgE high==
- eczema , thrombocytopenia, bleeding easily, sinopulm infections, lymphomas rise. 
- ==nosebleed/bruising + sinopulm infections + eczema = triad.==

==bare lymphocyte syndrome - class I TAP1/2== 
- ==decreased MHC 1 expression = **defective CD8 t cell activation**==
	- ==increased susceptibility to resp bacterial infections but not viruses==
	- ==class 1 - CD8 defective, terrible skin dz. bad granulomas.== 
==class 2 - defect in MHC 2, basically CD4 bad activation... cell mediated immunity,==
	low or absent MHC2 on macrophage, dendritic + b cells
	==defective CD4+ activation, cell mediated immunity, humoral immune responses bad.==

innate immunity - rapid response! phagocytes are monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes

==chronic granulomatous disease CGD - defect in NADPH oxidase (needed for generating superoxide ions + h2o2. ), phagocytes can't kill the ingested bacteria/fungi/catalase poz org==
- phagocytes can't readily kill ingested bacteria/fungi, esp catalase positive organisms 
- persistent microbial antigens inducing a ==persistent t helper response, making granulomas.== 
- ==poor wound healing post surgery, high rate of IBD, perianal fistulas and abscesses==
- pneumonias , osteomyelitis, lymphadenitis
- s. aureus, serratia marscecens, nocardia, aspergillus, burkholderia 
==most common form is x linked, involves a defect in 91-kDa chain of cytochrome b558.== 
==lab eval - dihydrohodamine 123, and nitroblue tetrazolium NBT dye.== 
- will see if there' activitiy or not 
==NBT - we look for any blue inside the cells - activity== 
==DHR - looking for oxidative burst , stimulated all the way over onto the right part.== 
- can tell if they're x linked or otherwise. 

==leukocyte adhesion def I,II,III - impaired migration of leukocytes into the tissues.== 
- ==beta chain of b2 integrins CD18, GDP fucose transporter, kindlin 3== 
- basically lots of wbcs, but can't **get to the site!**- ==usually fungal + bacterial, die from infections by age 2== 
- ==high neutrophilia but no PMNs in pus. - can't get to the location== 
![[leukocytes entering site rolling.png]]
recall they're supposed to roll and then get into the sites. whole point - we can't go into it. **no pus. but not good in the wounds.**  - number one - ==umbilical cords don't fall off -- that process needs the neutrophils to come== 

complement deficiencies 
==C1q, C1r, C1s, C4, and C2 deficiency: phenotype is sepsis, bacteremia, and systemic lupus erythematosus - **early defects**, lupus + sepsis early in life==
	sepsis early in life. + lupus too , C2,4 most commonly associated with lupus 
==C5-C9 (terminal pathway) deficiency: phenotype is increased susceptibility to invasive Neisseria infections **late defects, late in the complement system**==
	recurrent neisseria , and meningitis is huge 
==Alternative or MBL pathway deficiencies: phenotype is frequent encapsulated bacterial infection==
	not a skin abscess, massive and severe and recurrent. 

==complement regulator deficiency - C1 inhibitor deficiency - hereditory angioedema - not uncommon== 
- swelling of everything - give them c1 inhibitor and it goes away in 2 days
==factor H / I haploinsufficiency - mild reduction, we call it atypical HUS hemolytic uremic syndrome, blood in urine==
==homozygous factor H deficiency - C3 overconsumption, pyogenic bacteria== 

==chediak higashi syndrome - LYST gnee, lysosomal trafficking regulatory - defective lysosomal granule exocytosis, defective vesicle fusion + lysosomal function in neutrophils, macrophages, dendritics, NK , cytotoxic t cells, many other types too.== 
- recurrent pyogenic bacteria 
- albino, neuropathies, giant lysosomes in PMNs/neutrophils
---
toll like receptor defects
- ==TLR defect = irak4 defect- tlr signalling protein - terrible intraabdominal absesses.== 
- ==type I ifn signaling defects - HSV brain disease, huge absesses== 

==NK cell def - many mutations make this - **mostly for viral, increased severe herpesvirus**==
- ==NK cells are very low in SCID too remember.== 
- ==**recall - NK cells will kill the virus-infected cell**==

classification of primary immunodef by cell stage defect
- lymphocyte maturation
Severe-combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
	 X-linked SCID 
	 Autosomal recessive SCID (ADA or PNP defects) 
	 Autosomal recessive SCID (other defects) 
	 Reticular dysgenesis 

B-cell only deficiencies 
 X-linked agammaglobulinemia
	 Ig Heavy chain deletions 

 T-cell only deficiencies 
	 DiGeorge syndrome
![[immune maturation defects.png]]


- activation + effector (number's fine, activation/signalling is wrong)
X-linked Hyper IgM syndrome- CD40 ligand, CD4 helpers cannot talk to b cells 
 Job’s syndrome (HIES, STAT3 deficiency) - 
 Common Variable Immunodeficiency
 Bare lymphocyte syndrome  - granulomas 
 Defects in TCR expression or signaling
![[activation effector t defects.png]]

b cell defects
- redued serum IgG, reduced vaccine responses. 
- sinopulmonary infections 
- reduced b cell counts 
- absent/small follicles in lymphoid tissue

t cell 
- reduced counts
- reduced responses to t cell activators -
- deficient DTH - antigen proliferation? 
- mycobacter, fungal responses 

---
secondary / acquired immunodef
- age, malnutrition (protein/caloric), rads, cancers of lymphoid , etc splenectomy, treatment of drugs like anti-cytokine antibodies. 
	- anti IL5 agents for asthma+eczema, very targeted means of treating, just know what it causes. 
age on immunity 
newborn to 2 yo
- unable to make humoral response to T-independent antigens. don't give smoe vaccines bc they won't remember
- more HSV herpesvirus inections
elderly - thymic atrophy - reduced t cell responses, vaccine responses low, autoimmunity 

cachexia
==kwashiorkor - causes it, body mass preserved, but cell mediated immunity is depressed, severe lymphopenia + loss of DTH responses + edema==
low t cells. protein leaks etc. 
==measles can suppress t cell proliferation, cmv infected precursors too.== 
- ==post measles immunodeficiency - lasts 2-3 yrs. expressed on B/T cells, so measles infection wipes out previous acquired memories.== 
==sickle cell anemia- functionally asplenic due to recurrent infarcts.==
