#womenchild #clinics 
newborn screening NBS - great planning and scientific achievement. - think about why we do it, the core conditions, disease categories, follow up after a poz screen + where to find recs for follow up 
first half - tested on it. last half - different conditions, not tested by HER. 

Public health refers to all organized measures to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong life among the **population as a whole.** - a theoretically asymptomatic population. 
no federal laws that mandate it, but each state individually gets to make their own system/program in SC. - 
- ==conditions screened in newborn screening are individually rare but collectively common - and we **do** have a treatment. mostly has latent early symptomatic stage + suitable test for diagnosis later. cost of case finding is balanced with med care.== 

core conditions for NBS - that every state should screen for 29 conditions 
25 additional conditions that can be screened for and may be clinically relevant. 
==core condition , there's 25 of them - Newborn screening is specifically designed for these conditions - **very accurate test, good treatment, know health outcomes**==
secondary - sometimes incidental, not as accurate, treatments may not be effective, outcomes not well understood. 
2007 - newborn screening saves lives act - we don't have a governing body on the heritable disorders for newborns + children rn, also has regional collabs , baby's first test - widely available for all information that providers need to know about !

==RUSP -  added, 31 core , 26 secondary screens for the newborn screening panel- the recommended uniform screening panel by the SACHDNC==
close to 50 screened are metabolic disorders , rest are endocrine ones. 

_key slide - newborn screening overview_
- ==4 mil babies tested, required, not dependent on funds/insurance, some parents might opt out based on religious beliefs + NBS in addition to screening for hearing loss + congenital heaert dz==
- this is a public health service - screening for **hearing loss + congnital heart dz**
- ==NBS happens in hospital be4 baby gets home, 24-48 hrs after birth - if home birth, performed by **midwife or facility**==
- heel stick - to screen for genetic endocrine/metabolic disorer + point of care hearing + pulse ox test
	- ==in NBS, there's a heel stick and there's 7 spots, blood dropped onto the filter paper without layering or contamination. no exposure to heat, light, moisture too.== 
ideally families are aware before they're born, but they aren't aware. 
- heel stick on filter paper at 24 hrs. 
- if out of range "not abnormal bc its just a screen", call from HCP to family w/ follow up recs. 
- if normal might be mentioned at first well child visit 

filter paper - sent to lab, public state lab DHEC SC, assays used to screen or many diseases
- tandem mass spec, biochem assays for enzymes, and PCR based DNA testing 
- ==results sent to child's HCP , and notify them by fax + phone of abnormal result. (followup differs by state) ; AMA has ACT sheets with algos and recs for each condition==
what happens to HCPs?
- nurse or member of neonatal team does heel stick
- relevant specialist notified by lab
- contact family and arrange next steps - AMA has ACT sheets with algorithm and recs for each conditions, similar to baby's first test
	- https://www.acmg.net/ACMG/Medical-Genetics-Practice-Resources/ACT_Sheets_and_Algorithms.aspx
- see if it's a false poz or a true one 
==talk about - diet, preterm, timing of infants, transfusion - those can interfere with results; might get false normals if they get **transfused**== 
- like you might get false normals if they get transfused for instance. 

most of these conditions are autosomal recessive - a lot of parents might be silent carriers. - exceptions - hearing def, immunodef, congenital cyanotic heart dz, x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy 
- most cannot be cured - make sure they understand + recurrence risks. 

south carolina - cost per test is like 127$ - trying to keep up , screening for 58 conditions overall 
rest of the slidedeck - something we'd wanna know in general, not necessarily testable. 

spinal muscular atrophy - prog degen o motor neurons, most common inherited cause of infant mortality - most are type 1 ... by 4 mon of age, , cognitively "normal" , it's a motor issue - but we have a lot of super expensive treamtent.s 
- first ever zolgensma treatment at musc - was just 2023. (,: 
- krabbe dz - just in north carolina for treatment though. 
- we're falling behind in keeping up with the RUSP though. slated to add more syndromes too. 
we need to provide good information to the parents about the hx and about the offering of things. - these are important - and the impact we have is huge
