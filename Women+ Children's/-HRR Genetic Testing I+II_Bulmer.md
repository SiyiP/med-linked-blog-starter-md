notes
screening - to id low risk from high risk population- false poz and sometimes false neg. 
- maternal age, 35+ = elderly gravida for singleton, higher risk of fetal aneuploidy
	- and 33 or older for multiples 
	- don't use age alone! 
- first trimester screen - blood + US(translucency, looking for the fluids to be under 3.5 mL in size or 95th percentile), 
	- blood -hCG + PAPP-A, covers down, trisomy 13,18
	- ==Nuchal translucency - 3.5 mL + = automatic screen poz heart defects, some other conditions and aneuploidy in general == 
	- **hCG increased in downs , decreased in trisomy 13/18**
	- PAPP-A decreased in downs, trisomy 13/18
	- most are false positives... gives a 1 in X risk assessment, not a yes or a no. 
	- ==Just know 1.0 is normal for MoM for the First Trimester Screen, so just know low/high== 
- Second trimester screen - quad screen for 4 analytes 
	- AFP – produced by baby’s liver › low Down ,trisomy 18, **high for ONTD**
	- hCG – produced by placenta › , high down syndrome, low trisomy 18
	- ==uE3, estradiol – produced by placenta and baby’s liver › low down, trisomy 18==
	- ==DIA – produced by placenta - high in down syndrome==
	- tests for trisomy 18, downs, open neural tube defects ONTD
		- neural tube defects ONTD - spina bifida, anencephaly(higher), encephalocele (opening of the skull)
		- ==gastroeschiesis = not covered by the membrane. higher AFP but less associated w/ other genetic defects than omphalocele.== 
	for MoM, anything less than 1 = low, more than 1 = high , true for FTS too! 
	==2nd trimester screen has many false poz, worse than the FTS.== 
	- ==2nd trimester ultrasound between 18-22 wks==, look at the organs, and look at the structural malformations. typically normal variation 
		- soft markers - not birth defects/ malformations but features associated w/ inc risk of chromosome abnormality (usually tri18/13)
		- congenital <3 defects 
		- duodenal atresia double bubble, higher risk of downs. 
		- ==omphalocele - 30-50% risk of chromosome abnormality== 
			- higher risk of soft markers: thickened nuchal fold, ventriculomegaly, ==choroid plexus cysts is the only soft marker for tri18==
			- ==intracardiac echogenic focus , not a defect but a bright dot where the heart is, **as bright as bone**; talk to them about screening for downs==
			- ==renal pyelectasis - urinary tract dilation within renal pelvis, soft marker for downs== 
- more common is AFP single marker - some still offer this only, made by yolk then the GI tract + liver. 
	- too high = means there's some neural tube defects releasing that, and abdominal wall openings. 
	- down syndrome, trisomy 18, no huge raise. 
	- ==unexplained elevations in AFP - incidence of placental insufficiency - like oligohydramnios, etc. placental abruption, htn.== 
- ==cell free DNA testing - any time after 9 wks, maternal blood only with the fetal DNA (cfDNA) fragments inside the placenta! - non-invasive prenatal screening - great for down syndrome, slightly less than 13 ... only shows poz or negative.==
	- more accurate!!! more conditions too, best test for everyone
	- any time after 9 wks gestation
	- maternal blood only 
	- low false poz/neg. 
	- no testing for neural tube defects tho! 
	- ==placental cells will break down and release fetal DNA fragments called cfDNA - sequenced to get chromosome of origin., cell free DNA testing measures aneuploidy, and we look at the ratios of base pair== 
		- detects aneuploidy of 21,18,13 and sex chromosomes! 
		- typically there's like 10% of these fragments in maternal blood - going off the assumption that the mom doesn't have those same defects. 
		- they will them look at the base pairs and sort them into chromosomes, telling u where they're from. should have ratios similar to the maternal amount - **if the ratio's thrown off, high risk results**
	
screenings factors that influence it: 
- gestational + maternal age, weight
- more weight = greater blood volume, dilution of analyte
- race = AFP 10-15% higher in black pts than white pts? 
- ==diabetics. =**lower AFP on avg, and higher risk of neural tube defects**==
- recall that ==AFP increases naturally throughout pregnancy, so gestational date matters, and with any low amniotic fluid, AFP more concentrated== 

adjusting a pt's risk: start with their prior risk which as age etc. background risk
- risk assessment provides another ratio , like FTS 
- basically 1/50 background risk -> 1/532 detected in screen -> (1/532*1.8 = 1/295) -> final risk is 1/295 with that soft marker?*
- ==background risk ratio (maternal age, etc) BEFORE any screens -> then replace with 1/532 FTS result risk... then we multiply with risk due to soft marker 1.8 = final risk.== 
- so 99.7 chance of no down syndrome, .3% of it 

diagnostic tests - confirmatory , invasive, expensive, generally for at risk, definitive answers/dx. both have small chance of complication/loss
prenatal dx - for at risk families, but can be for anyone
- ==type of diagnostic test = chorionic villus sampling / CVS - 1st trimester- better access to placenta. - use a catheter, to get some placental cells and looking at whole cells. **genetically identical to the fetus**== 
- ==type of diagnostic test amniocentesis - 2nd trimester , 15+ weeks. enough skin cells in the amniotic fluid to test it. testing for AFP by putting a needle thru the abdomen.== 
both of these get cultured in cells, and then get a karyotype and do other tests
- definite Y/N for aneuploidy - fish for more rapid results
- follow up to poz cfDNA/other screenings. 
==microarray in addition to FISH is now offered to all invasive tests for diagnostics.== 

![[Genetic Testing II_Bulmer_PPT.pdf]]
carrier screening - primarily autosomal recessive 
80% of children with a genetic disorder are born to parents with no family history or symptoms of the disorder; limits - some residual risk can be missed
these are mendelian recessive or x linked conditions ... 
tay sachs has decreased due to awareness!!! 
if both are carriers - 1/4 chance 
x linked - females carriers, 50% risk for sons to be affected

==pretest counseling/education should note - carrier screening is voluntary , confidential and protected in health insurance and employment by GINA (2008), we'll talk about potential results, but residual risk not highlighted. then test partner for AR conditions==
- review, possible results, and test the partner for the same autosomal recessive conditions. 
- current recs from ACOG are based on ancestry and fam hx - everyone should be offered the targeted screening ideally before pregnancy - get a family hx, any ethnic bgd and consanguinity. only repeated in certain conditions, consider cost + only repeat in certain situations. recommended patient shares with family members if poz 
	- ==cystic fibrosis and asthma carrier screening for everyone, all other things in parents based on ethnicity!== 
cystic fibrosis - more than 95% males with this are infertile due to congenital bilateral absence of vas def 
- cystic fibrosis 1 in 25 carrier freq in white + ashkenazi jewish populations 
- carrier screening - DNA for select mutations/CFTR sequencing... many labs screen with next-gen sequencing, complete gene looked at. 
- ==complete CFTR gene sequencing + duplication analysis allows for more== 
	- ==only useful for ppl who are white + ashkenazi jewish. but still screen all patients. some gene modulator therapies.== 
- there's spectrum of clinical severity, some milder variants might be used to detect affected individuals 

hemoglobinopathy carrier screenings
- 4 subunits, 2 alpha, 2 beta, 4 heme groups on hemoglobin 
- 2 main types of globins - alpha and beta globin chains are equal in precursors to RBCs, 
- ==Hb A = adult hemoglobins, which have 2 alpha and 2 beta globins 2a2b... chromosome 16 encodes a-like globins, and 11 encodes b like globins==
- structural hemoglobinopathies
	- hb S, hbC can be variants of hemoglobin with no effect 
	- ==sickle cell dz - **abnormal hemoglobin due to homozygous mutations in the beta globin gene, HBB** -== can clog up blood flow, anemia in sickle cells. 
		- ==SCD - recessive, vaso-oclusive events _ anemia. seen **spleen get infarct and destroyed -> more infections**==
		- african americans are 1/10 carriers of this most often hb variant is Hb S 
==you will include in the hemoglobinopathy carrier screening the CBC and THEN hemoglobin electrophoresis==
- ==serum ferritin used to rule out iron deficiency too== 
- ==electrophoresis results show: Hb A - highest in normal; but HbS increase in sickle cell!==
- the higher the fetal hb, the better the disease bc it's helping to prevent the sickle hb 

==thalassemia - reduced production of a hb chain, so lower **overall amount of hemoglobin**==
- ==alpha thalassemia - in african, asian, central american, med, and middle eastern-  no alpha globin being made; recall chromosome 16== 
	- ==hemoglobin bart hydrops fetalis - HbBart - more severe, fetal onset of **edema, effusions, severe hypochromic anemia** - fatal, no alpha... so 4 deletions  (- - / - - )== 
	- ==hemoglobin H HbH disease- microcytic hypochromic hemolytic anemia, mild jaundice, and bone changes sometimes. - some alpha chains are there. mild to moderate anemia, but we see **liver and spleen getting too big.** we have 3 deletions, ( a - / - -)== 
characterized by how many genes are present! caused by deletions of alpha globin genes HBA1 and HBA2 in alpha globin gene cluster on **chromosome 16**
- ==one deletion = silent carrier==
- ==2 deletions = alpha thalassemia minor - asymptomatic, but microcytic anemia on exam==
- 3 deletions - HbH dz - symptomatic, transfusion dependent later on in life
- 4 deletions - HbBarts - not compatible, hydrops fetalis. 
![[Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 5.09.17 PM.png]]
cis = same chromosome, trans = different ones 
- ==cis carrier - higher chance of passing down hbh and hbBarts; common in SE asian backgrounds== 
- ==trans carrier - always passing down one since both chromosomes have a deletion, no chance of hbbarts though. common in african and mediterranean populations.== 
==alpha thalassemia - genetically test w **multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification** MLPA to detect deletions, sequencing for less common point mutations.== 

==beta thalassemia - common in mediterranian + african american - autosomal recessive - microcytic hypochromic anemia, **abnormal peripheral blood smear**, reduced HbA on analysis -> screen with routine CBC at beginning of pregnancy for checking any microcytic anemia (low MCV <80), then hb electrophoresis + then ferritin! ==
- routine CBC (at beginning or pregnany) - mirocytic anemia = arrier. low MCV <80 
- hemoglobin electrophoresis for beta thalassemia - **elevated HgbA2 + HgbF**
- make sure to use ferritin sr to determine this vs the iron deficiency anemia. 
==ppl with thalassemia major - severe anemia, hepatosplenomegaly - failure to thrive + shortened life; B+/B+, b+/b0, and b0/b0, bone deformities seen too but it's homozygous==
==ppl with thalassemia intermedia - present later, have milder anemia in the future. risk of iron overload secondary to increased intestinal absorption of iron due to ineffective erythropoiesis; we see b0/b or b+/b+; might need blood transfusions occasionally== 
- you can make up a bit of the hbA with Hb delta. 
more common with Mediterranean + african american 
==B = no mutations normal== 
==B+ = mutation that allows some beta to be formed, but reduced==
==B0 = most severe, no beta chain formations.== 
- ==thalassemia minor - carrier b0/B or b+/b, asymptomatic w/ microcytic anemia.== 
- intermedia - b0/b or b+/b+ - might need blood transfusions occasionally 
- major homozygus b+/b+, or b+/b0, and b0/b0, extreme, splenomegaly + anemia, bone deformities, etc. 
![[Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 5.22.45 PM.png]]
both B-thal trait and Alpha-thal trait leads to DNA studies to determine this. 
- ==beta-thalassemia trait can be seen with microcytic anemia and HbA2 3.5+== 
- ==alpha-thalassemia trait seen with HbA2 less than 3.5% and normal iron levels.== 

==Ashkenazi jewish screen for: cystic fibrosis, **Canavan syndrome**, familial dysautonomia and Tay-Sachs disease==
- considered to have that ancesory if 1/4 offspring ; basically at least one grandparent is full that

==french canadian / cajun - increased incidence of tay sachs disease.== 

==spinal muscular atrophy - progressive weakness in muscles, 2nd most common fatal AR disorder, after CF; SMN1 mostly deletion of both copies, although SMN2 is pseudogene, more mild phenotype of this==
- onset birth to young adulthood, huge classification by age of onset
- SMN1 - gene associated. typically ppl have 2 / 3 copies of this, carriers have single copy,
	- deleted for both - homozygous deletion of exon 7 in SMN1 
- SMN2 gene copy number also impacts clinical course. - a pseudogene, not making as much protein. 
	- copy number modulates phenotype, inc copy number of this = milder phenotype, not a guarantee. 
==SMA screening - dosage test - how much of SMN1 and SMN2 do we have? 2+ copies = normal, one copy = carrier. can't determine point mutations.== 
==treatments for SMA spinal muscular atrophy - zolgensma + nusineren==
zolgensma - super expensive AAV vector delifvering a normal copy of SMN1 gene to target motor neuron 
Nusineren - alternative splicing of SMN2 will convert it into SMN1 

Fragile X - women with family hx or autism/intellectual diability 
- ==fragile x make sure to screen if women have ovarian insufficiency, elevated FSH before 40 yo, and make sure they get screened if they get late onset intention tremor + cerebellar ataxia== 
- girls have it as well - ==fragile x is a trinucleotide repeat expansion in FMR1, of CGG, triggering hypermethylation, silencing that gene== 
- ==males - more larger head, long face, prominent forehead + chin, protruding ears. CT findings and large testes.== 
	- expansion of CGG on FMR-1 gene promoter - triplet repeat
	- triggering hypermethylatin which will silence the gene, lack of gene mutation. 
	- intermediate repeat = 45-54, grey zone carrier. ==fragile x premutation 55-200 only female can carry over and expand. same deal (only female risk of carrying over+expanding, **not for male transmission**)==
	- full mutation 200+ 

expanded carrier screening -will screen them, very much more inclusive. addresses ancestral uncertainty, casting a big net. 

"profound - shortened lifespan during childhood, intellectual disability"
"severe" - death in early adulthood, disabiling malformation 
"moderate" - neurosensory impairment, immune def/cancer, mental illness, dysmorphic features
