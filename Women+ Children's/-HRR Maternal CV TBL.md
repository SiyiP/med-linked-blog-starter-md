==minute respiration volume with pregnancy, minute vol increases, increasing pao2, reducing paco2, making alkalosis , and kidney compensatin, plasma hco3- lower.== 
![[minute volume with pregnancy.png]]

General preg/physiology 
focus on pulm + carddiovascular + hematological phys - 
- resp min volume goes up 
==more co2 blown off to facilitate o2/co2 fetal transfer -==
==tidal volume goes up by 200 ml== 
==cardio - peripheral vasodilation, more CO, more SV and bounding/collapsing pulse.== 
==hematologically more plasma volume, less platelets, more wbc, and more *fibrinogen+factpr 8.* more hypercoagulatility== 
- ==progesterone is the biggest effector. hcg will spike early and then go down later, but the prog will be produced early in the corpus luteum and then placenta takes over in 2nd trimester== 
	- prepare endometrium for implantation + **nourishes growing fetus.... also regulation of BP early + later in pregnancy**

==focus on why is there anemia in pregnancy? also on CO especially in late pregnancy in relation to posture. - bc of extra albumin, and more CO due to preload!==  
and hemodynamics. and RR, tidal vol etc. 

placenta - in parallel to other vascular beds. 
arrythmias, tolerance, changes in heart shape in size. 
cardiomyopathies that occur right after birth or at birth 

when there's flow there's always a pressure gradient, one that's inching forward P1 and P2 resisting it, and delta P which is P1-P2. so P1>P2
what determines Q flow? we have **poiseulles's equation** 
==length of blood vessel * viscosity / radius== 
- ==radius is inversely proportional to the resistance by a power of 4... more the radius = less resistance.== 
- pressure gradient proportional to flow 
- pressure gradient = flow * R
- ==R = pressure gradient / Q flow==
==SVR = mean arterial pressure - resisting flw pressure is the **right atrium pressure**/CO * 80 dynes s cm^-5==
pulmonary vasc resistance = pulmonary arterial pressure - left atrial pressure / CO * 80 = dynes * s * cm^-5
- ==but in either of these just drop that 80 given in Wood Units.== 
under normal hemodynamic conditions = **right atrial pressure = 0!!! so you can simplify the SVR.**
==SVR = MAP/CO * 80==
cannot make the same assumption with LAP or left atrial pressure, which is like 10 mmhg

resistance in series = R1+R2+r3; if flow is occluded everything distal is occluded, no Q. 
resistance in parallel 1/r = 1/r + 1/r + 1/r 
so the effective ressitance is lower than the lowest of the circuits. 
==all our systems are in paralell bc of low resistance== 
==**uterine flow = 2-4% of CO in a NONpregnant state**==
	==later it will increase to 15-20% of CO!!! a huge increase! 1/5 of the blood flow. isgoing into. theuterus. so then we can see in **US if there's a difference in the blood flow, if there's occlusions more risk of ecclampsia**==  
	
placenta = an organ in parallel - **something that grows and is added in parallel - there's. a maternal side and a fetal side - ==the maternal blood goes in via spiral arteries.**==
==blood volume will increase, dramatically== 
==but plasma vol does faster.== 
- ==now because the total blood volume is bigger, and the **plasma** is, the **RBC doesn't increase as much** - **we get physiolgical anemia** - **lower resistance to flow, increased volume that protects against blood loss @ childbirth**== 
- increase in CO of placenta, kidney, skin 
- incrased RBCs too = higher oxygenatio needs... 
- also all the factors of prothrombotic things increase during pregnancy 

==CO in general goes up during pregnancy - **laying on the left lateral = more CO**==
==if you lay flat on ur back CO decreases due to the **positions of the growing uterus and the vena cava returns** - we often rec them to do left lateral - to decrease **vena cava compression**==

==CO = SV * HR ; volume ejected from heart per min, SV = vol from ventricle per beat.== 
==CO = MAP/SVR==
==CO = VO2 oxygen consumption / (CaO2 what blood picks up from lungs -CvO2 venous o2,== measured in the right atrium, how much of arterial blood consumed all that?)
- if it's iwider, e kno that we used more o2 in CaO2-CvO2. 
- CO directly proportional to Vo2 

==CO during pregnancy - SV increases in 1st trimester then plateaus, but remains elevated==
==HR steadily increases then plateaus in the end .== 

CO = mean arterial pressure / SVR
- huge dramatic drop of SVR in 1st trimester but slowly creeps back up never to the original 
- MAP = **we have no significant increase in BP! very slight**
from a clinical standpoint, inc in blood volume is balanced by the fact that we have wayyy less ressitance with SVR. 

==BP during pregnancy - we see normal values... in systemic ones. but a huge drop in **diastolic pressure, meaning the smaller resistance.**==
Os pressure = difference between systemic and diastolic = widens during pregnancy then returns to normal 
- this effect is due to prog thru many signalling mechanisms 
- ==prog - vascular smooth muscle cells + nuclear receptors== 
	- ==**reduction of cytosolic Ca, which promotes SM relaxation + remodding blood vessels**==
	- ==add more BV + desensitizes ang2 receptors (these will be increasing Ang-1-7 , which is an ACE enzyme, a vasodilatory peptide vs Ang2 which is a vasoconstrictory)==
	- ==so we have normal BP in spite of increasing Ang2...== 
	- ==but in **preeclampsia we have less Ang2 + Ang1-7 and less progesterone!!! so the Ang2 receptors are not desensitized is in normal pregnancies.**==
	- preclampsia - in the 3rd trimester seen... some people with risk of that, think of that rebalancing of constriction vs dilation, like taking baby aspirin. 
Please remember Fick eq 
Q = VO2 / Cao - Cvo2 
VO2 = Q * (CaO2-CvO2)

O2 consumption incrass linearly during pregnancy, but then AV O2 difference falls (more blood and we're not extracting as much o2,) but goes back up (we start using more and more o2 again)

exercise - CO higher in pregnant women, achieved at lower exercises.... not shown to be detrimental. but is there some pts to be told? 
- will fetal circ be reduced with mom's exercise? 
- just keep to your normal tolerance, unless you can't. 

arrythmias - benign - mild sinus tach 
non specific STT changes in ECG
PACs/PVCs/ - new normal in heart. 
- if they have an underlying arrhythmia. -**worsened symptomology like arrhtyhmia, undx structural ez, elctrolyte disturbances, thyrotoxicosis**
- a giant stress tst = pregnancy 
---- 
time left off 37:37
==never forget - thyroid disease can get worse and into thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy - some thyroid disorders specifically due to pregnancy and get them into SVT.== 

enlarged heart due to elevation of diaphragm. ==PMI different! also some **compression of venous return to heart** + lower extremity edema.== ==Left ventricular mass increases by a lot during pregnancy - neither eccentric nor concentric==
- eccentric hypertrophy - dilated heart, greater inc in myocyte length than width, larger chamber or volume ; volume overload usually
- concentric hypertrophy - more thick muscle walls, a lot more myocyte width. ; prssure overload
- physiological - proportional increases, will go back to normal within 6 months after pregnancy - similar to exercise ! both chambers will remodel. bc of that we get more lefft ventricle mass. 
	- ==ejection fraction will increase early on in pregnancy and then decrease with plateau== 
==on the frank starling curve, we mainly just see an increase in preload / stretch = increase in dimensions is an increase of preload => huge change in increase in stroke volume== 
- some valvular dysfunction like sounds of murmurs etc will be augmented due to the incease of preload in the mother. 
- ==increase in contractility therefore stroke volume== 
- preload = left ventricular end diastolic pressure. 
- mitral valve prolapse click will move later on in the systole - like in squatting
- intensity of aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, and then aortic regurg/mitral regurg. 
	- ==**strength of murmurs will increase due to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy + MV prolapse**==

==peri/postpartum cardiomyopathy - more bc we're better at diagnosing it? more risk factors now.== 
==New onset heart failure between the last month of pregnancy and 5 months post delivery with no determinable cause==
- very specific definition - **new onset, last month of preg. + 5 month post delivery,**
- ==high output heart failure - where your heart can still pump normally initially either ith reduced or Preserved EF, but body increasing need for blood.== 
- ==basically CO is higher.== 
- seen in echos... some baseline info on what the EF is ...if we don't have that we might mistake postpartum cardiomyopathy for eclampsia or htn urgency. 
- only about 30-50% recover fully ): depending on incident EF 
- ==recurrence goes up with more pregnancies ): those that do recover have rrisk still but not as significant.== 
	- thoguht to be antibody mediated or inflammation 
certain meds that cause rebound tachycardia too that can cause it. 

pulmonary function tests with pregnancy 
- ==FRC functional residual capacity and inspiratory capacity make up your TLC.== 
- ==bc of **increase in diaphragm, your FRC and specifically your expiratory reserve volumes will decrease a bit!!!**== 
- tidal volume will be normal breath in and out air. 
- ==overall tidal volume changes significantly bc of extra... so you have the minute respiration will change.== 
	- minute vol = Tidal vol * RR
	- drives increase = tidal volume which goes up like 20% in pregnancy 
	- RR doesn't go up. 
==minute vol increases **PaO2, reduces PaCO2. (baby offloads, so we need to decrease more of that in the mom to make their waste flow to her easier)**==
- ==kidneys of mom compensate with secreting more bicarb - **mild respiratory alkalosis**==
- ==in the case of acidotic state like diabetic ketoacidosis etc... note **pregnant moms more likely to become acidotic when sick.**==

==Pulm vascular resistance - **decrease in this!**==
- ==dilating the pulmonary vessels, more blood flow thru lungs they can get rid of more CO2 and pick up more o2.== 
first 2 trimesters a decrease, then back to prepregnancy levels 
all these changes - > PaO2 early increase.. like 95 mmHg, -> 105 mmhg
40 mmHg PaCO2-> drops! to help with fetal gradients
so your pH increases from 7.4 to 7.44 during pregnancy 
o2 exchange in placenta... 
- in spiral arteries of mom: 
- pO2 = 98 , sO2 = 95%, 
- fetal umbilical arteries = pO2 = 19 , sO2 = 50%.
- they mix together: pO2 = 50 mmHg. oxygen tension in placenta. 
umbilical veins will **have more pO2 from the umbilical artery blood mixing together with the spiral artery in the placenta**
- umbilical veins now pO2 = 30 mmHg bc hb is different in fetus. so it's enough o2. 
uterine vein back to the mom is po2 = 33 mmhg, goes back to lungs etc.

TBL Lecture Section
prevention or occlusion of of venous return - preload reduced. 
tidal vol goes up = increasing breathing = by nature will decrease CO2. 
==remember 4,1, 3,2==
==7.44 pH== 
==104 pO2 higher than 95 normal== 
==30 pCO lower than 40 normal== 
==20 HCO3 lower than normal== 
![[pH Ratio screenie.png]]usually someone w/ hypertrophic myopathy that was undiagnosed would show up **early!** 
the whole thing with the question was a heart failure question, not an obstructive one.

application execise 
case 1
28 yo preg pt cbc hgb and hct are 12 + 36... 
at 28 weeks it will look like HgB = 
how does pregnancy affect dz? goal - get o2 to fetus 
hgb = 10 bc the **hemoglobin would go down - due to plasma volume going more, so basically the hemoglobin measured per DECILITER goes down even tho RBC goes up**
- differential besides the physiological anemia
- macrocytic anemia 
- iron deficiency -> microcytic anemia
- **B12 deficiency too which can lead to macrocytic anemia**
- think of global region - alpha alkothalasemia / sickle cell dz -> so send a gene test too 
- GI bleed - usually gonna be hb lower than 10 ... 
- HELLP syndrome 

f/u - 35 weeks gestation, HA - pre-eclampsia for bp control, hgb 13***. 
- her hgb didn't go down (abnormal) bc
	- edema and proteinuria -> increasing the amount of blood? 
	- decreased progesterone relative to normal pregnancy -> **pre-clampsia blood pressure gets "leaky", more hemoconcentrated. kidneys start getting dilated, spilling protein, getting EDEMATOUS, huge inc in hgb**
cardiac dz - not normal pregnancy - syncope w exertion, postural noc dyspnea, angina , sustained arrhythmia + diastolic murmurs are never normal. and **anything sustained is never normal.**
normal preg - has dyspnea + orthopnea. veryyyy common with exercise or any movement - totally normal. and lower extremity edema too - systolic flow murmurs normal 

pregnancy relatd physiologic changes. - 
enlarged cardiac siluhouse 
inc min vent
dec hco3-
increased CO 
the xray to order - would be a chest x ray 
CO ges up due to HR and SV inc... but the SV will plateau but stay elevated end of first trimestre
- any further CO inc driven by HR. 

due to the differences in respiratory reserve (decreased, they get **hypoxic way quicker**)
- decreased reserve - quicker hypoxia. 

getting tests - CXR, ECG, Echo
arterial blood gas - not needed , "baby is the next vital sign" ; we want information based on mom's oxygenated. 
VBG - venous gas - 
normal EF, BNP, echo showed a bicuspid aortic valve - **most common congenital reason for aortic stenosis**
left ventricular hypertrophy - seen with EKG voltage gradient, we get that with a stenotic valve! 
BNP during pregnancy - shoudl always be normal. uusally on higher end of normal 
- stenotic valve - **preload dependent, since its more narrow, we need to put more blood thru. less blood going in thru that.** = like a fixed CO. can't augment it more than you'll allow. 
- body tries to augment by inc HR, tachy = less filling time, less CO , gets angina. 
how you would treat
- by beta blockers. 
	- all of them are safe, but stay away from atenolol bc of fetal growth restriction. 
- minimize pain in labor - to give bolus epidural + minimize anxiety
- if you worry about volme overload due to stenosis, do diuresis. volume is the issue 
ABG is still good to get a prediction on what the O2 sat at 90% is and why 
- also think of any AKIs + PEs. 
- BNP too 
cr = .9 high for pregnancy, but it's within normal for non-pregnant. 
- GFR goes up in pregnancy 
- Cr = is lower due to hyperfiltration in pregnancy. 
also think about inverted uteruses. 

with more bleeding - loss of blood- acute hemorrhage
**we get tachycardia first, as a compensation to the leakiness of the vessels to try to pump more -> hypotension due to loss  and not able to fill as much? -> hypoxia - > coagulopathy because our factors EVENTUALLy get eated away**

 - you end up getting into DIC when you chew up in 
 - only factors that dont go up during normal pregnancy: factor 11 and 13. - you have sooo many procoagulants to chew up to get to DIC.
