**know on the TEST - the type of vaccine - toxoid, subunit, live-attenuated etc for all 17!!! routine vaccines in the US, CIs, what an adjuvant is, types of vaccines that need adjjuvant and what they're made of** 
contrast polysaccharide + polysaccharide conjugates in terms of **age group efficacy** 
herd immunity + types of pathogens + why the threshold of immunity needed may vary 
mRNA how are they able to induce immunity 
know abbreviations for vaccines

**don**'t need to know the schedules of vaccines. 
they reduce disabilities, prevent cancers, helps travel etc! empowers women, bioterrorism protection 

==passive immunization -immune effector cells or antibodies are transferred from immune person to naive one - passive bc not lasting== 
==active - immune response stimulated in person protected; the goal of vaccination is to get this in 1-2 wks for a fast and strong 2ndary immune response thanks to B/T cells== 
goal of vaccination - give a primary immune response - 1-2 weeks - basically if you do it with a safe vaccine, your secondary immune response is faster, stronger secondary rsponse that prevents disease. thanks to memory B/T cells 
there's a clonal selection and expansion in specific T/B cells leaving behind some memory cells - this is what vaccines in general do. 

you must have dendritic cells antigen presentation by it, and then these of the innate immune system presents co-stimulatory molecules to the t cells - need t cells for humoral + cell mediated response 
==T cells - costimulatory molecules for CD8+ are 86 AKA B7., presented by innate immune system's antigen presenting cells; so basically any vaccine needs to awaken both innate+adaptive== 
any vaccine must stimulate both innate AND adaptive immune system ^^

==attenuation - same pathogen but just less virulent - reduction of pathogenicity -== 
	==it's grown in a different host species + gets mutations that allow it to reduce in pathogenicity, while maintaining the same antigenic determinants as the virulent strains for the immune response to work.== 
if you vaccinate with the ==live polio vaccine, type 2 and 3 only have 2 key mutations from the attenuation, so they occasionally revert and cause paralytic polio.== - recombination DNA techniques can safely improve this - site-directed mutagenesis to make them more safe. 

==live attenuated orgs - make stronger immunization -  longer challenge, appropriate induction, MORE antigens== 
- longer antigenic challenge- 
- induction @ appropriate sites
- ==MORE antigens, less likely to be subject randomly to MHC restriction (like if you don't have some that present peptides from that antigen you dont respond to the vaccine); many proteins to choose from in the live one== 
- ==simple proteins instead of life attenuated organisms may only induce a humoral response - might need some boosters== 
herd immunity - so many ppl are immune that dz can't maintain itself or sustain a chain of infection - our goals of vaccination 
- ==herd immunity is to protect people who cannot develop immunity like newborns + pregnant women + immunocompromised.== 
==R0 - avg number new infections started by an infected person during illness course - depends on agent infectivity, duration of shedding, environmental conditions + health status + behavior of population.== 
when you have an estimate, you can estimate the herd immunity to stop the spread 
==herd immunity = 1 - 1/R0==

duration complicated by chronic carriers, common sources of contamination ... affected by population density + susceptibility of people 

==adjuvants - substances added to vaccines to enhance the immune response, required by all nonliving vaccines!== 
- ==aggregate antigens (recall you need to **cross link 2+ antigen receptors on B cell** to activate them) - you need a **polyvalent antigen for all this** (and viral + bacteria naturally do that, but vaccines need it)==
- ==inducing inflammation - activation of the innate immune system== 
in the US: only 3 types of vaccine adjuvants here
- aluminum hydroxide/phosphate
- certain lipid emulsions
- CpG 1018 - synthetic DNA sequences 

nonliving vaccines - require adjuvant!!!
==Aluminum adjuvants are present in the following U.S. childhood vaccines:== 
== hepatitis A== 
== hepatitis B==
== DTaP, Tdap== 
== Hib  - haemophilus influenzae type B.== 
== HPV==
== S. pneumonia (pneumococcus)==

vaccine types for active vaccination 
- live attenuated
- intact killed/inactivated
- toxoids - formalin inactivated toxins
- purified subcellular fragments/antigens conugated to protein - conjugate vaccines
- proteins expressed from recomb DNA
- lipid nanoparticle mRNA 
knows the 17 dz commonly vaccinated for - don't need to know the order. 
1. ==hep b vaccine - only one that's given @ birth, a recombinant one with purified HBsAg protein + adjuvant== 
	1. ==hep b severe CI in yeast allergies, but usually always safe==
	2. good - no chance of dz transmission + well defined components
	3. ==hep b limited # of epitopes so some don't respond bc they don't have the MHC== 
2. ==RSV passive/active - targeted to elders + infants== 
	1. ==RSV active vaccine - more recent - recombinant vaccines containing RSV fusion protein in pre fusion conformation (before they bind), 2 made, one for 60+ and pregnant ppl to pass immunity thru placenta in sept-jan and other for 60+ only==
		1. pfizer vaccine abysvo approved for adults 60+ and pregnant ppl 32-36 wks from sept - jan - **pass the immunity over placenta**
		2. GSK arexvy for adults 60+ only 
	2. ==passive RSV - nirsevimab - for all infants younger than 8 mon born or entering first RSV szn sept - jan without maternal antibodies== 
3. ==rotavirus - live attenuated - only live attenuated given be4 age of 1 - given orally as a suspension to induce IgA in intestines== 
	1. induces IgA in the intestines 
	2. 2 vaccines are currently licensed. - ==for rotavirus - **first dose given before 15 wks, and they should receive it all BEFORE 8 months old**==
4. ==diptheria , tetanus, pertussis- DTaP  - toxoids for it all== 
	- ==formalin cross links proteins making it nontoxic but same structure gives immune response.== 
	- ==corynebacterium dipteriae diptheria, clostridium tetani tetanus, and acellular pertussis aP inside the vaccine... not whole killed cell bc it causes seizures.== 
	- ==multiple doses needed every 10 years for lasting immunity, starts at 2 months of age==
	- ==TdaP - **given to adults, meaning same ingredients diff ratio, reduce the diptheria toxoid**==
5. tetanus - DTaP
	- start in 2 months of age. 
	- clostridium tetani 
6. pertussis - DTaP
	- acellular pertussis aP is inside the vaccine - original whole killed cell caused siezure.s 
	- needs a booster - adults can have it if not, but most dangerous for children under 1 
7. poliovirus - IPV - inactivated poliovaccine - **whole intact killed organism**
	- inactivated w heat or formalin. 
	- ==poliovirus is IPV, whole intact killed organism with formalin or heat; oral vaccine replaced it until it was eradicated and then US switched to inactivated - almost extinct== 
	- inactivated - rabies - also given after exposure / vets, and typhoid, given to travellers 
8. ==haemophilus influenza B - conjugate vaccine - most pathogenic when it expresses polysaccharide capsule, and type B very pathogenic in kids under 5 -==
	- ==antibodies to type B capsular - protective, but poorly immunogenic in ppl under 24 month== 
	- if you're ==<24 mon , or 2 yo must get the conjugate vaccine for effective protection!!!!== 
	- ==conjugate bc T cells **only see protein; proteins will recognize the protein antigen in MHC but not the polysaccharide**==
	- ==B cell - recognizes polysaccharide and the protein as long as it's aggregated- - b cell rxn to influenza B vaccine's polysaccharide while the t cell recognizes the protein== 
		- ==h. influenza B **conjugate vaccine mechanism**: b cell activated by polysaccharide part of conjugate and processes conjugate + presents *peptide from protein* on **MHC2 with B7 + CD40**, then the CD4 T cells recognize the protein, peptide activates making CD40L + CD28, going to lymph node edge.==
		- then the CD4 T cell recogizes the protein part,  that peptide is activated to make CD40L and CD28 ; goes to the edge of the lymph node 
		- ==T cell makes B cell isotype switches + makes memory cells - acting as both APC + humoral effector== 
9. ==streptococcus pneumoniae -  **we need to make a conjugate when the polysaccharide is the virulent part of the bacteria.** - conjugate== 
10. ==influenza - whole intact killed / inactivated ; but there's an intranasal live attenuated vaccine , given ages 2-65 yrs.== 
11. ==measles - MMRV - measles mumps rubella varicella vaccine given after 1 yr - 4 live attenuated vaccines== 
12. mumps 
13. rubella
14. ==chickenpox varicella - there's a newer recombinant adjuvanted vaccine==
	1. ==2 dose, 90+ effective! recombinant glycoprotein E viral envelope + adjuvant suspension== 
15. hepatitis A 
16. ==HPV - gardasil 9 (strains), recombinant capside protein in yeast, 2 doses before 15, but 3 if started at 15 or later.== 
17. neisseria meningitidis

==Adults should get: Tdap / Td booster every 10 yrs, influenza yearly, pneumococcal vaccines like prevnar - 20 once after age 65, and 15 once after 65 followed by pneumovax. and shingles/varicella booster== 

no CI of combining vaccines into a single shot - like DTaP-IPV-Hib - no reason to not do this, you already get exposed to so many antigens per day dw about it 

==COVID vaccines are all vectored vaccines with adenovirus vectors used to transduce it - but the very prominent one are lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines, where a lipid envelope w/ protective antigen with ligands there that activate TLRs to get innate response.== 
- basically a lipid envelope has a protective antigen with ligands on thaere that activate receptors like toll like receptors to get innate immune response 
- ==when the lipid membranes of COVID vectored vaccines fuse to cell membrane - they release mRNA into cytoplasm, where the ribosomes translate it into SPIKE protein, which is given to immune system via dendritic cells or phagocytosis of vaccinated cells== 
- also they have to make sure lipid envelope was very good bc the RNA is very unstable 
- ==big hurdle to lipid membraned - we need to make sure we actually translate it, but it wasn't bc it was activating RIG, **the antiviral state which shuts protein synthesis down in the cell.**== 
	- ==innate immune system was shutting down production, so they tricked it by adding **1-methylpseudouridine** to evade the response and type 1 interferon response! making the mRNAs immunologically silent.== 
why would modded nucleoside ==LNP mRNA vaccines are immunogenic bc of injection trauma -> dendritic cell activation already ; DAMP produced, TLR agonists in lipid nanoparticles, and both B+T cell responses are detected== 
shown that 4th dose is still advantageous - we can continue to boost immunity

biological risks and obstacles
- immunological differences - ppl have diff immune systems
- ==risk - prior antigenic exposures + circulating antibodies can reduce ur response to a new one==
- ==risk - some pathogens have too many serotypes or genetic diversity around the world== 
	- some pathogens have high levels of immune response in naturally infected ppl but response isn't protective 
	- many like syphillis, candida, HIV etc. our natural immune response is really up there against them but not protective against new infections 
- coinfections
- age 
==live attenuated vaccines - CI in immunocompromised==
maybe allergies too 
==some ppl should get vaccinated earlier: asplena and sickle celll anemia + any congenital deficiencies of humoral immunity, which is why they need capsular polysaccharide vaccines earlier for their b cells!==
