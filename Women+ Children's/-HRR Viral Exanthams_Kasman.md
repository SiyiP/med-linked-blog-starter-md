viral exanthem - an eruptive disease or its symptomatic eruption; skin eruption 
==prototype exantham - measles - diffusely distributed, blanchable, erythematous macules (flat) and papules (raised) is the classic picture==
==-viral *enantham* = eruptive disease on a **mucosal surface**==  
- measles enanthem manifested as koplik spots 
- often enanthem accompanies an examthem 
- other common causes are coxsackiviruses + HSV 
can be the rash or the infection itself 
==prototype measles rash = morbiliform== 
drug eruptions can also look like that. 

viral exanthems - long incubation period before the rash 
- ==rashes = late manifestations of adaptive immune responses, basically virus already thru the blood and cells are attacking it in the skin.== 
- person infects be4 the rash is appear
- note - person's lesions are filled with the virus 
==![[Exanthams chart 1.png]]==
all spread respiratory 
don't memorize incubation periods just know it's longer . 
rash will vary 
dont memorize illness duration
complications vary + fetal infections yes. 


==![[Exanthams Chart 2.png]]==
==all pox viruses - pustular== 
don't memorize the symptoms / complications. 
fetal infections memorize 

==rubeola / measles - "5 day measles" - paramyxovirus, morbillivirus, -ss RNA== 
- ==enveloped w HA and fusion protein spikes, no NA.== 
- highly infectious!!! respiratory, one serotype 
- ==syncytia + viral shed , then hematogenous spread in prodromal period== 
- ==3 Cs , prodromal/before the rash, 3 days of it== 
	- ==coryza (mucous inflammation in nose) , cough, conjunctivitis== 
	- ==photophobia , sometimes koplik spots white salt appearance in mucus membrane== 
	- ==all secretions = infectious== 
	rash starts in head and spreads downward. fades in order of appearance, brownish yellow due to capillary hemorrhage. 
- ==immunologic rxn to virus in **capilary endothelium -> dilation and extravasation of red cells = blanchable**==
- lesions correlate w anti measles antibody, show vasculitis, perivascular mononuc cell infiltrates 
- ==common - superinfection + pneumonia giant cells.== 
- ==very rare - encephalitis, likely autoimmune, deaf/blindness. or neurodegen disease wild measles before age 2== 
- ==measles paradox - we get robust long life protective immunity to measles but **profound leukopenia during acute infection bc kills memory lymphocytes**==
	- basically we after infection you just have measles specific memory cells. immunocompromised for 2-3 yrs after. 
==we need to do dx based on clinical symptoms, confirm w/ anti measles IgM pcr.== 
==supportive therapy + Vita A ... but we give a live attenuated vaccine @ 12-15 mon and booster @ 4-6 yrs== 
==*note - rubeola of measles is very similar to rubella, but rubella is shorter in term and mild/undetectable in children.*==

---
==rubella - "german measles/3-day measles"- + ssRNA enveloped, one stable subtype called rubivirus== 
- inhalation 
- multiples first in cells of resp epithelium + lymph, then spread via blood
- ==winter-spring.== 
- ==very mild, rash is mainly first evidence of dz, adults might have prodromal phase where there's malaise!== 
- ==**forschheimer's sign** - enantham of dull red petechiae on soft palate, in about 20%of pts.== 
- ==rash appears with the adaptive immune response==
- no antiviral, but ==a vaccine.== 
complications
- ==migratory arthritis post-rash, due to immune complexes + t cells==
- ==thrombycytopenia + hemorrhagic diathesis is rare==
- ==post-infectious encephalitis - **CD8+ T cell mediated**==
	- ==**congenital Rubella syndrome - CRS - huge risk, infection in first 2 wks, super early, she didn't even know shes pregnant.**==
	- ==blueberry muffin, low birth weight, pneumonitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, hepatosplenomegaly== 
	- ==classic triad - microcephaly, PDA, cataracts.== 
	- basically IgG maternal from plaencta to baby , then IgG chronic infection + viral shedding for 6 mon 

==mumps - paramyxovirus -ssRNA, viral envelope mediate attachment to sialic acid,== 
- ==HA NA spikes, cytotoxic F protein== 
- resp transmitsion, ==winter spring==
- ==goes to salivary glands, CNS, gonad.== 
- ==no rash, then we get swelling of salivary parotid gland due to necrosis + edema + infiltrates.== 
- complications: encephalitis, pancreatitis, orchitis/oophoritis. inffertility rare. 
- no antiviral, but ==a vaccine== 

==parvovirus B19 "fifth disease, erythema infectiosum", small, naked virus w ssDNA genome, hardy==
- ==resp spread, mild disease in immunocompetent kids==
- ==profound anemia in ppl who are congental anemia or immunocompromised==
	- ==can cause sickle cell / thalassemia compromise, aplastic crisis , protracted anemia long term.== 
- hard to determine but ==50% of adults have arthropathy , lasting months + lymphadenopathy / splenomegaly by immune complex depo== 
- ==**rosy cheeks** - facial erythema and  lacy reticular rash spread to rest of body== 
- ==**bind to group P antigen/globosides on erythroid progen, erythroblast, megakaryocytes / endothelial cells** = will stop hematogenesis.== 
- look for ==B19 IgM/IgG antibody==, DNA etc **bone marrow biopsy with deficient mature erythroid precursors**
- no vaccine + no treatment except supportive ): 

==roseola infantum - exanthem subitum - HHV 6,7==
- ==6 mos - 4 yrs of age exclusively ... everyone seroconverts by 5 yrs==
- ==establish latency, asymptomatic shedding for life.== 
- no treatment/vaccine. 
- ==high fever 3-5 days , breaks then rash - **common cause febrile seizures.** disappears in 48 hrs. complications rare.== 

varicella v variola ; chickenpox v smallpox 
==![[Varicella v variola.png]]==
==chickenpox - varicella = worse on trunk; shingles, a painful rash caused by chickenpox virus herpes zoster... stops at midline.==
- in crops / multiples maturing differently 
 
variola = poxvirus/small pox - worse on extremities + face. 
- umbilicated - -**indented/necrotic in the center, tissue's collapsing in on itself**
- all lesions mature together - in one crop / stage. 
- extinct since 1979! no vaccinations anymore. weird - **dsDNA that replicate in cytoplasm**
- respiratory , contagious without symptomes. 
	we see on biopsy - **guarnieri bodies, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies** in epithelial cells. 

==vaccinia - used as a smallpox vaccine - evolved from cowpox, passage of skin on calves==
- they were lyophilized and scratched in to inoculate. 
- ==**replicates locally, makes single pox + heals leaving a scar.**== 
- possible - immunocompormoised systemic spread

==mpox/monkey pox - very close to variola, similar symptoms but not severe.== 
- zoonotic, person to person 
- resp droplets, body fluids, lesion material. sex. 
- ==prairie dogs in NA/==
- there's a vaccine to protect in 2019 
- ==umbilicated lesions like smallpox==

==alaskapox - emerging, alaska, 1st docu in 2015, nothing person to person yet bc rodents zoonotic, but 1 seen death.== 

orthopoxes - serious - variola, vaccinia
molluscipoxiviruses - not serious - molluscum contagiosum 

==molluscum contagiosum - seen in kids - itchy small pustules, skin to skin contacts + can be seen as STI, mild dz==
- ==umbilicated papule.== 
- ==necrotic center = **molluscum bodies, hypertrophied thing**==
- ==goes away on own, or we can ablate it off==
- can recurr in the same person
