some slides that are just here for your knowledge. 

case 1 
- picky eater, 60th% weight, 50% for length 
- mostly fruit + veg + cows milk , 50 oz a days, 26mon old 
- too much cows milk 
anemia low hb, mcv, hypochromia
**iron deficiency anemia** - most common micronutrient def in the world 
- ==3 stages of iron deficiency anemia== 
	- ==iron depletion== 
	- ==iron def erythropoiesis== 
	- ==iron def anemia==
- due to cow's milk - low iron content, occult intestinal blood loss due to the consumption + inhibition of non heme iron absorption by ca and casein. 
80% of iron accreted during 3rd trimester of pregnancy 
recall - iron reqs 
- premies - 2-4 mg/kg/day 
- infants 0-6 mon .27 mg/day 
- 6-12 mon 11 mg/day 
- toddlers = 1-3 yrs  = 7 mg/day 
recall - as they go thru their own erythropoiesis they will use up their iron 
- risk - poor neurodevelopment - can be longlasting 1-2 decades after
- also huge in preventing lead poisoning
- you can do delayed umbilical cord clamping to have iron too 
breast fed infants need supplementation thru 12 mon of age. 
all babies should be screened at 12 mon

case 2 
18 mon old , edema , periorbital but now worse. 
drink poor, less active 
no hx of weird bowel stuff, but vomitting 3 days before. 
exclusively breastfed til 13 month ago, then weaned to cow's milk , worsened eczema, so they put him on "rice milk"
most striking - albumin is 1 (fear of losing it in urine)
urinalysis - no protein lost. 
is the liver failing to make albumin? no labs. 
then think - **deficient protein intake** 
![[protein reqs children.png]]super important for growth etc. - especially with premies make sure they got enough 
note - make sure we note which milk is best to use. rice milk is deficient. there 

==what happens with severe protein malnutrition -== 
- ==kwashiorkor - bilateral edema due to malnutrition== 
- ==Severe protein malnutrition • Marked muscle atrophy • Abdominal distention (+/- hepatomegaly) • Think, dry, peeling skin • Dry, hypopigmented hair • Skin lesions/dermatitis • Growth retardation • Bilateral extremity swelling • More than just dietary protein deficiency==

- ==marasmus - z score <-3, and use the weight for height measure. **no edema, wasting syndrome**; but usually occur together with kwashiorkor== 

pathophys of severe malnutrition
Cardiovascular: ‣ Output and SV reduced when lean body mass loss 
▸ Liver: ‣ Hepatic gluconeogenesis is reduced (hypoglycemia) and decreased metabolism of toxins, reduced synthesis of protein 
▸ GI: ‣ Mucosal atrophy in small bowel impairs digestions, electrolyte abnormalities (Mg, K) slow motility, diminished gut barrier can lead to bacterial translocation ▸ Immune: ‣ T cell immunity, IgA levels, complement levels, and phagocytosis are diminished  
Endocrine: ‣ Low insulin levels, cortisol level increased ▸ Metabolism/circulation: ‣ basal metabolic rate reduced 
▸ Skin and glands: ‣ Atrophied fat, loose skin folds, may be hard to judge hydration status
==extra note about ZINC - huge for stature, cofactor for alk phosphatase, so if it's low, suspect malnutrition.== 

starvation pathophys 
day1-3, liver glycogen depleted, less insulin
day 7 - catablism o fat + protein for hepatic gluconeogenesis 
day 8-10 - source of eenrgy is ketone bodies
day 30+ msucle catabolism of lean muscle = death 
- **kids have less liver glycogen/fat/protein stores = hastening starvation**

==refeeding syndrome - hyperglycemic bc the fluids are low. as they get mroe and more, the fluids will shift, so ions will intracellular, getting precipateous drops, and then thymine is deficient.== 
- ==hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, salt + fluid retention, thiamine def== 
- ppl die from this. 
- ==cardiac arrhythmia, fluid overloaded heart failure, encephalopathy==
- happens in all ages. complex health needs
start at 25-50% of caloric reqs and then monitor and advance over 3-7 days
- monitor electrolyte esp phosphorus

NICU, pre-eclampsia premie. parenteral nutrition 
==parenteral nutrition - helpful as life saving measure - complex solution = only use when no reason to give enteral nutrition(GI system is nonfunctional), given right into the junction of SVC/IVC, the RA... thru a central line.== 
- indicated in pts when GI tract is nonfunctional or can't be accessed! 
- only use when no reason thru enteral nutrition 
- given thru a central line - right into the right atrium, junction of SVC/IVC
- careful for risk of infection + clots. 

giving them trophic feeds like maternal breast milks - 
- ==enteral nutrition - passing it thru the intestine, either naturally via mouth / esophagus or some artificial opening== 
	- ==orogastric tube==
	- ==nasogastric, nasoduodenal, nasojejunal==
	- ==gastric, gastrojejunal==
	- ==jejunal== 
for inadequate oral intake + airway protection + bad intestines (crohns dz, etc) 
CIs: GI bleeding, ileus, free air, pneumatosis, hemodynamic instability like bleeds.

2 wk old, cystic fibrosis center screen poz 
shiny 8-9 stools, 2-3 vomiting, less than birth weight ): breast feeds
- ravenous after breast feeding , mom gives formula 
- **exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, not able to digest fat + protein**
what to do to improve her nutrition 
- increased energy needs + increased energy losses
- we need to make sure their weight for length is 50+ percentile when less than or greater than 2. 
- ==BMI should be 22+ and 23+ in women + men with CF, their energy expenditure is higher==
- ==exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - certain vitamins are fat soluble, so deficiencies in ADEK is seen.== 
- give them - Pancreatic enz replacement therapy PERT, which helps break it down, putting it in their food as a capsule. 
- supplemental cals in oral formulas or tube feeding. 
==note - we might od on ADEK. can get toxicity in all these things.== ![[fat soluble vita toxicity.png]]
