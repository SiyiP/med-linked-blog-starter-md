big topic - some of this is biochem heavy
nutrition - in the first 1000 days, conception to 2nd yr of life - is huge for milestones. a lot of this development is irreversible. 

==timing of nutritional imbalances in certain periods of life is huge, in pregnancy + in first 2 yrs. translates into diseases later on== 
baby w/ birth restrictions = metabolism slower, more prone to obesity etc - developmental origins of health + dz. 
- this is ==nutritional programming - in which nutrition based dietary intake/behaviors== in first two determine everything else. 

key outcomes - neurodevelopment (loss of iq points/diminished capacity with low iron), obesity + CV dz, with diets high in energy, excess protein, sugar, etc. 
allergy + immune disorders - early development = subsequent development of it later in life
- early intro promotes the development of tolerance to potential allergens. 

hard to recover from these early effects/deficits later in life. shaped by caregivers ofc. 
- programming of metabolic, immunologic, cognitive, and behavioral functions 
==pattern of low birth weight -> stunted -> small pregant woman -> low birth weight/pre term. **this is a perpetual cycle**==
- **stunting** is the thing where the kid is more than 2 SDs less than where they should be - long term poor nutrition causes this. this contributes to economic problems in poor countries

types of malnutrition
- undernutrition - wasting, stunting, underweight, 
- micronutrient related malnutrition - vita a , iodine, iron def
- over nourishment - DM, <3 dz
patterns of child growth - 
- wasting - low weight
- stunted kid - short

clinical nutrition. -
- how many lbs in a kg? kg = lbs / 2.2
- measured in kilocal, calories
- 30 mL in an oz,
- calories in 1 oz of whole milk, etc. 
- ounces are used to describe caloric concentration in fluid. 
- nutrition and fluid reported in kcals or mls per kg per day 

energy req are dynamic in 1st few yrs 
- infants 110 kcal/kg/day ; with 3.6 kg infant = ~400 kcals ; we grow more 
- 15+ kids are 40-45 kcal/kg/day ; so a 65 kg adult female: 2600 kcals 
fluid reqs
1st 10 kgs = 100 ml/kg/day
2nd 10 kgs = 50 ml/kg/day 
weight above the 20 kgs = 20 ml/kg/day
also micronutrient diff = we need more iron in premie than an infant or adult

at 4-6 mon , when they start to prop themselves as they fall, they could probbly start eating solider foods that are like iron fortified. 
![[1 yr infant feeding chart.png]]
will drink as they're older
also under 1 yr old, solid foods are just to introduce them to the skillset needed to eat them. 

most common nutrition concerns in infants
vitamin D def
- rickets
- vita d should be promoting innate immunity + preventing cancer/diabetes
- ==vitamin d - a common concern with infants, innate immunity ; supplement w **400 IU / day** until they're weaned to at least 1 L/day or 1 qt/day== 
- ==All non-breastfed make sure if they get less than 1000 mL / day of vitamin D fortified formula/whole milk , they need 400 IU/day sup== 
- **whole milk only for kids after 12 months**
iron deficiency 
- usually full term infants have stores until 4-6 mon, then after that introduce iron rich foods
- WHO: iron fortified foods introduced first like meat. 

==toddler - unpredictable feeding. from on-demand to regular time based meals is slow==
- structured meal + snack time instead of grazing. 
- bottle from sippy cup
never forcefeed them. they need time
model behavior - feedback for good/bad behaviors like eating vegs/throwing food
==meal - chaining - new foods introduce w/ loved foods. introduce new food 10 x== 

don't restrict fat/cholesterol unless they're obese. 
might have too much milk/dairy - so at 1 yr old, no longer need formula but can continue to breastfeed. 
- excess milk - high in calories, low in iron. 
- need protein, ca, vita A/D
juice - no need for juice, 100% , and limit to 4-6 oz a day

adolescents
- comparable to adults diet. 
- low consumption of fruits/veg, whole grains, ca + low fat dairy 
risk for - iron deficiency anemia like teen girls
- poor bones
- eds
- obesity 

measuring success in growth - anthropometrics. 
- elusive, but can be hard to get
- <24 months = we would measure your length in cm,,, we need to use a board
height = 2 yrs + able to stand, need to use something to get the head down. 
- ==alternatives for nonmobile patients, equation to extrapolate to a height. like from tibia length==
weight = in kg, going all the way to the gram. 
- alternatives - wheelchair scales, bed scales
- mid upper arm circumference MUAC
head circumference 

body proportionality 
- weight/length <2 yrs old 
- bmi if 2+ yrs older
- graphed in kids to get a percentile/z score
mid parental height
- not rlly used too much 
- should estimate where they should fall based on their parents height. 

growth chart
x axis = months/years in age
y axis. - growth parameter like length, Head circumference, etc.
exception - weight for length curve. 
choose the right growth chart
==infants - 2 yrs ; use the WHO growth chart - weight length, head for age, and then weight for length curve==
2-20 yrs - CDC using height instead of length. 
- weight, stature, and bmi for age

==specialty growth chart - premies, corrections for GA , down syndrome, turner, CP, etc.== 
- ==for premies, we do weight thru 24 months, bringing them back onto the growth chart., doing some corrections.== 

z scores = measurement from the mean. 
- wasting = when weight for height z score -2
- stunting = height for age -2 ; basically pattern is wasting -> stunting -> HC deceleration 
- underweight weight for age <2 sds from mean, so -2 z score. 
- overweight = +2 z score. 
	- **BMI overweight 85-95%, obese 95%+**

always poor growth = insufficient usable nutrition
- improper formula mixing, food supply or neglect 
- inadequate absorption - vomiting + malabsorption, sickness
- ==another reason for poor growth = heart disease / malignancy taking up too much energy== 
- metabolic diseases 
get away from failure to thrive = just describes a syndrome not helpful. 

==growth chart==
1) ==Plot on the correct growth chart (WHO or CDC or special)==
2) ==Ensure accurate measurements and correct transcription onto growth chart== 
3) ==Describe the growth chart • ‘Trending along the x% until age and then….’== 
4) ==Describe the most recent growth point== 
	1) == ‘At the xth% for weight, yth% for height, making him the xth% weight for length (or BMI if >2 years old) and zz% for HC)’== 
	2) == System is transitioning to z-scores== 
5) ==If possible ‘name that pattern’: stunting, wasting, overweight, etc.==

case 1 
6.5 yo girl, fatigue, cold intol, dry skin, constipation; sick on exam. 
mom 5'2 and father 5'7, so mid parental height 157.3, 17.6% percentile

her growth chart - since the age of 3, patient has been trending along the 50% for weight, and stature at 75%, but for stature went down to the 7th percentile at age 6. 
- based on the mid parental height she should be somewhere between the 10th - 25th percentile ): 
she has endocrinopathy - stunting - mid parental height gives rapid and reasonably accurate index of their growth potential. 
most kids get adult stature +/- 10 cm of target height
- endocrinopathy = preserved weight/obesity in a short child; weight there but height is not. 
- systemic disorders like IBD or CF = stunting ; thin for their linear linear growth.

---
case 2 
pt trending on the 25th percentile, and gradually loses height until less than the third percentile at 15 years. 
and then her height growth child is trending along the 50th. 
her weight for length has been trending on the 25% until falling to less than 3rd percentile at 14. 
- this is a kid who has malnutrition / wasting
- crohn's disease. 
- weight loss = **will proceed height loss, thin for height, low bmi**
in IBD = other nutritional deficiencies related to inflammation . 

low weight for age w normal length/height = inadequate nutrition . some kids are small. 5% is healthy for some people. 

low length / height for age = short stature, 
- if low weight gain/month followed by decrease in height = inadequat nutrition 
- weight = normal with slow linear growth = endocrine/genetic
-
microcephay - recall poor weight gain = poor linear grwoth = poor head growth = inadequate nutrition
