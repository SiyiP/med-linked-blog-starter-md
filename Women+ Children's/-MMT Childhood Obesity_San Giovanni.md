most common chronic dz of childhood - obesity . increased over the years. 
there's a waxing + waning of treatment + recurrences - have to do w ACEs, etc. 
==BMI - not ideal but gold standard screen that's super easy. - a tipping off point and low cost. for kids - **in percentiles bc kids are always growing**==
==overweight - 85-95%== 
==class 1 obesity 95-120% , **BMI 30-34.9**==
==class 2 = 120-140% , 35-39.9== 
==class 3 = 140+ , of 95tile , 40+ BMI== 
we have an extended bmi thing - growth chart is a good indicator of change 
==under 2 yrs old? - we start, we have a **weight for length from when they're born to 2 years old.** and anything over 97% is concerning== 
- anything over 97%ile is concerning 

PCPs manage
- asthma, ADHD, obesity!!! need to dispel many myths
- **children DO NOT outgrow obesity, a disease not a lifestyle.**
- ==fat mass - body's defense against starvations, the setpoint in the brain defends the fat mass set point to hold onto fat. hard to lose weight bc it's regulated by the brain. makes it so hard ):== 
- ==hypothalamus - energy in to energy out.==
	- ==but dopamine and cognitive things will override our hunger signals!!!== 
	- ==also the prefrontal cortex stops us when we're full! but kids often dont have that all the way yet. hard for kids to know to stop eating==
genetics - run in families
SDOH/food insecurity / sleep, Early life risk factors (maternal diabetes, premature babies grow fast), 
microbiome, special healthcare, psychosocial stress. 

we need to start early, make sure to always have this convo 
- discuss healthy eating long after pts are infants
- more meals at home, 5-6 x week eat as afamily 
- daily healthy brekky 
- involve in healthy
- 5,2,1,0 
	- 5 or more fruits/veg per day 
	- 2 hrs or less of screentime
	- 1 hr physical activity 
	- 0 sugary drinks, more water. 
==if we have one concern, **refer early to intensive health behavioral lifetyle treatment, NO WATCHFUL WAITING**==
- 3% redo in BMI in 1 mon, 5% in 1 year. 
- 26+ contact hours of interventions over 1 year. 
==intensive health behavioral + lifestyle treatment + MI , then supplement with pharmacotherapy(12+ yo) options if that's the case. then lastly surgery if nothing else== 

we have an algo for this , a1c, fasting lipids, hb etc. 
- ask questions + do other things 

• Use Neutral terms – weight, body mass index, Unhealthy weight • Never use: obese, extremely obese, fat, weight problem • Remove obese in your physical exam
- describe it as a disease - having obesity as an illness 
- eliminate weight checks - use nutrition visit/goal check
- overweight = obesity - only for documentation and risk assessment in note!! not put in patient note. 
no shame!!! 
- believe + validate, dont focus on weight
- ASK to discuss weight + bmi. "is it ok if we discuss your weight/bmi today?"

MI
- ask, tell, ask approach. did you know that ACA had a limit on ___?no i didnt know? Oh okay, so what do you think about that? __
- assess where they are in making change. simple question make sthem think about it 
- bring it up on the next visit ... 80% aren't ready about this, just let them know that bc you're their doctor you'll bring it up again. 
evoke change talk - 
- what do you wanna change // if you did, how would u go about it ? // whats the 3 most important reasons to change. 

small quick tidbits, avoid lecturing - "the AAP recommends, or evidence suggests"
- make 1-2 SMART goals 
- ==SMART goals = Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Based==
CDC - swork it kids, gonoodle 
---
anti obesity pharm - not options until recently - it's a chronic dz - so you need treat it as any other chronic disease. 
- we're gonna need it for a long time. 
- we have sooo many weight promoting meds. and then weight neutral ones that we can switch to. 
==GLP1 agonists -semaglutide/liraglutide - slows food in digestive track - 5-16% decrease in BMI - but CI in pts w aversion to needles, hx of pancreatitis , personal hx of this thyroid + multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome 2== 
- SE n/v 
==phentermine/topiramate ER - NE reuptake inhibitor, modulation of GABA receptors, CIs are CV dz, uncontroled htn , anxiety, glaucoma, etc.== 
phentermine - SNR - like a stimulant - 
==orlistat - a lipase inhibitor blocking fat absorption but not a good med to be on ): - chronic malabsorption syndrome, cholestasis , liver dz, or renal impair== 
==setmelanotide - very specific; melanocortin 4 receptor agonist, to treat people with this specific POMC deficiency or *bardet biedl* syndrome might cause obesity - CI of depression tho ): -== 

bariatric surgery - cause weight loss via - restricitng amt of food stomach can hold, malabsorption + neurohormonal response will change 
- nowadays we have minimally invasive laproscopic surgery - only 13+ yo. 
==roux en Y gastric bypass - connect the gastric pouch to the small intestine== 
or ==gastric sleeve with removing the portion of stomach== 
outcomes - huge, lower body mass before the surgery = better outcomes
==TEEN-LABs - for youth undergoing surgery. reduction great outcomes.== 

referrals - will take a while - has a whole process to discuss , like meeting w psych etc.  following up with pcp and wait 6 months 
many support groups post surgery 
- ==many vitamin deficiencies post-surgery CI!!!! - iron, b12, risk of anemia + bone mineral density loss==
- periop conditions and complications pretty low 
- CI: if there's a medically corectable cause of obesity like a gene we do that first
- CI: any substance abuse
- CI: pregnancy 
treat other comorbidites all the same time

==Lab work!!!== 
==CMP – kidney, liver, fasting glucose== 
==• HbA1c== 
==• Lipid panel== 
==• +/- TSH/T4  - thyroid more common in adults, family hx== 
==• Genetics testing - from infancy !!!== 

==HTN is higher rate, we need to make sure to get it every child 3+ yo ... less than 13 years old... we do it via percentiles. anything over 95% is concerning.== 
sometimes we do renal US with doppler. 
if we don't know the perceptiles - **pediatric bp app**

T2DM - start at 10 or onset of puberty, get fasting, HbA1c 
- risk factors - fam hx, overweight etc, maternal hx diabetes, signs of insulin resistance - acanthosis etc. 
- similar to adult s
- ==diabetes Diagnosis: FBG ≧126 • Random ≧200 with classic hyperglycemia symptoms • HbA1c ≧ 6.5 • Should have 2nd confirmation test prior to starting medication==
- ==treat metformin as adults==

==dyslipidemia - teens will get atherosclerosis - screen early on!!, btween 9-11 yo and then after puberty== 
between 9-11 and then after puberty - for picking up kids who have family hx 
in non fasting state non hdl cholesterol can be accurate 
==cut offs - a bit different - LDL 160+ is concerning== 

selective screening if worry about family screening in 2-8 yrs old. 
9-11 is universal. , but then during puberty only if risk factors 

when begin statin? ==![[when begin statin.png]]==
kids tolerate it better. no muscle pains like adults
kids tolerate statin will.... 

==NAFLD - in kids with obesity - **presenting with abdominal pain**- risk for CV dz, sleep apnea veryyyyy important, CPAP==
PCOS - obesity + insulin res, periods not normal. 
depression - huge. highest odds were among females. screen all 12 yrs+ with PHQ 

==orthopedic comorbidities - SCFE - very common hip + knee pain, stress on growth plate will cause slippage==

==idiopathic intracranial htn - higher in females, inc venous pressure, CSF, huge headaches.==
