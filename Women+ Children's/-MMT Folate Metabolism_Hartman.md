![[8. Folate Metabolism_Hartman_NOTES (1).pdf]]

one carbon metabolism / folate 
==B9 - a soluble vitamin, folic acid is what you find in multi vitamins. we cannot make the linkage between the ring and the rest of it so it's essential== 
==active form of folate - **tetrahydrofolate**, has 4 extra hydrogens on the pteridine ring + can carry 1 carbon units that vary in oxidation state== 

==food sources - has a folate with linkages to glutamates... - polyglutamination== 
- between carboxyl group + alpha amino groups. 
- ==has to be converted to the mono glutaminated form to be absorbed by enterocytes and then will be distributed==
- ==then at the target tissues, they undergo poly glutamination again to **trap** the tetrahydrofolate THF into the cell== 

during development, the daily amount needed will increase- additional folate needed during pregnancy + breastfeeding. 
==pregnant women need most liver + yeast extract to correct birth defects + anemia from less folate intake== 

other foods of folate
- broccoli, breast milk, legumes, veg, fortified breakfast cereal 
- beer + other ones. beer has niacin + potassium etc. but too much is bad bc of acetaldehyde

==dihydrofolate reductase converts folic acid to tetrahydrofolate THF w/ 2 NADPH + H==
- a two step process , same enzyme, using NADPH + H
- ![[THF from folic acid.png]]
==just know - you add 4 total H atoms and NADPH coming from the pentose phosphate pathway== 
- ==the rate limiting enzyme of pentose phosphate pathway is glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase== 
- 2 steps making NADPH 
- dehydrogenase ones always make the NADPH! 

one carbon groups - can be carried by THF... varies in oxidation states
- most reduced = CH3, methyl 
- intermediate. = CH2 , methylene
- most oxidized - CHO, CHNH, formyl, etc. 

folate metabolism step by step 
1. ==two step conversion of folic acid to THF via NADPH and dihydrofolate reductase== 
2. ==THF will pick up a methylene group , **converting serine to glycine** via the enzyme **serine hydroxyltransferase**, making 5,10-methylene THF.== 
3. ==5,10-methylene THF can be used by **thymidylate synthase** to turn dUMP to TMP, to reform the dihydrofolate completely.== 
	1. ==5,10-methylene THF can also be used to be further oxidized into **5,10-methenyl THF**.==
4. ==5,10-methenyl THF can be **hydrated** into **10-formyl THF, used in purine biosynthesis to reform THF**==
		==1. 2 steps in purine biosynthesis, **just know the 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate is needed**==
5. ==5,10-methylene THF can also be used to make 5-methyl THF by **methylene THF reductase**==
	1. ==5-methyl THF is used for synthesis of methionine from homocysteine, with **methionine synthase.**==
	2. ==methionine will be ATP'd into SAM... a methyl donor, which then donates, making== 
	3. ==S-adenosyl *homocysteine*, then gets h2o'd, making adenosine leave and making homocysteine.== 
		1. ==to go from homocysteine and make methionine again, we need to give a methyl group from *5-methyl THF , **which passes it first to B12, which will then transfer to make methionine!!*** basically both B12 and folate is necessary here==
*********note - we need both vitamin B12 and folate for this step to work! 
6. ==after we donate that methyl group , the 5-methyl THF turns into reforming the THF.== 
7. ==THF + some amino group from histidine degradation then will make 5-formimino THF==
	1. ==all we need to know - **we get FIGLU from initial histidine degeneration**==
	2. ==FIGLU acted on by Formiminotransferase , making **glutamate** at the end , and 5-formimino THF== 
==********FIGLU used to test for folate deficiency!!! it accumulates as a result of not having enough folate, after testing histidine load**==
==for B12 deficiency test for MMA==
8. ==deamination of 5-formimino THF -> 5,10-methenyl THF== 

note B12 and folate deficiency 
- ==B12 = presents with neuro symptoms in addition to all else compared to folate deficiency !== 
- note - specific b12 testing MMA , and folate we just test histidine load then FIGLU 
- ==megaloblastic anemia does not distinguish it.== 
- if you have neuro symptoms and suspect b12, check the MMA test. 
==![[folate metabolism full.png]]==
key components to memorize
- 10-formyl THF for purines 
- conversion of dUMP to TMP
- conversion of homocysteine to methionine 
- serine glycine thing too sometimes. 
all in all - necessary for: serine, glycine, and histidine metabolism, methionine regen, purine biosynthesis, and thymidylate synthesis 

==amino acids contribute 1 carbon units into the folate pool being carried.== 
- ==serine + glycine = > gives methylene grp== 
- ==histidine - > formimino group== 
- ==tryptophan -> indirectly gives formyl group (other formates from methanol can be seen)==

health benefits of folate
- intake protects against complications in preg, cleft lip, male fertility 
- neural tube malformation 
- ==folate gives protection against homocysteinuria - seen with no folate, predisposes to stroke== 
- ==folate = essential for nucleotide biosynthesis, paradoxical with cancer = if you starve cancer of folate, they will prevent formation of cancer.== 
	- needed for biosyntheiss + repair of dna 
	- adequate folate can be anti-carcinogenic, so some chemo drugs stop folate. 
	- ==fluorouracil looks like dUMP, so it can compete with it in thymidylate synthase, **binding irreversibly** ; cannot make the dTMP, will destroy it and it's suicide inhibition.== 
	- ==aminopterin + methotrexate - looks like dihydrofolate, binding in dihydrofolate reductase, so we cannot make THF.== 
	- ==we can prevent folate deficiency with taking 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate... since cancer cells don't take that up as well.== 
- megaloblastic anemia - **hypersegmented nucleus with many lobes**
==![[megaloblastic anemia histo.png]]==
multivitamin - recommended for all childbaring women, befoe they even think about being pregnant. 
- some studies - might help protect htem from cervical + colon cancer. 
- ==400 micrograms per day for women== 
- ==up to 800 micrograms during pregnancy== 
- ==500 micrograms during breast feeding== 

==**methionine synthase deficiency / folate trap**== 
- ==note if we don't have much methionine synthase, you will accumulate 5-methyl THF ;==
- ==not passing methyl group to B12 and then homocysteine== 
- ==so you trap the THF in that form!!! functionally - a folate deficiency bc cannot form other forms; so we have  megaloblastic anemia  + homocysteinuria== 

==**5,10-methylene THF reductase deficiency** to make 5-methyl THF ... also homocystinuria bc we can't make it== 
- ==no folate trap. we're still able to do other stuff in our cycle, no megaloblastic anemia==
