![[Fuel Metabolism in Neonates I and II_Dalton_PPT1-compressed.pdf]]
main focus - rate limiting enzymes and how the metabolic pathways all connect into the whole body 
starred things for the congenital metabolic dz states are new - and we can listen to old lessons too 
pregnancy in the 1st and 2nd trimester of growth - mom's steady glucose helps maintain that 
- 75% of maternal blood glucose levels are going to the fetus -> makes more ATP for DNA replication and membrane/organelle genesis of new cells 
late in pregnancy = third trimester = less of a rapid growth phase, more of a fuel storage with using their liver. 
solids = fructose introduction in the kid at 3 month.

==nucleotide metabolism== 
- ==just know the rate limiting enzyme - carbamoyl phospate synthetase II CPS II== 
	- ==pyrimidines - CPS II is Rate limiting thing.== 
	- ==CPS I enzyme is for the urea cycle. recall that this will tie into this,== 
		- ==creates the carbomoyl phosphate in the mitochondrial matrix.== 
		- ==CPS II will make it in the cytoplasm.== 
- just know how much ATP 
- ==2 ATP are required for pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis + one for PRPP generation==
- ==3 Total ATP for each pyrimidine mononucleoside + 2 more ATP to generate the tri phosphate form==
==purines = shorter name, bigger structure, need more aTP== 
- ==GPAT is rate limiting enzyme - glutamine PRPP amidotransferase== 
- ==5 ATP are required for purine nucleotide synthesis + one for PRPP generation = 6 Total ATP for each purine mononucleoside + 2 more to reach the tri phosphate form==
	- ==so 8 ATP per nucleotide needed.== 

==pentose phosphate pathway== - just know the 2 important products for cell division + rate limiting enzyme
- ==need ribose 5 phosphate (from PPP)==
- ==NADPH required for deoxyNTP fomation (from the nucleotide making) and FA synthesis. this is a huge energetic pathway for synthesizing stufff.== 
- ==glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase rate limiting - **glucose 6 phosphate** an intermediate of glycolysis can also enter into this pathway -> make NADPH== 

==how to get ATP into these fetal cells - uptake the blood glucose from ma. most turn into pyruvate via glycolysis in cytoplasm, which then turns to acetyl coA in the mitochondria== 
- acetyl coA = key - can come from fatty acids, ketone bodies, etc etc. 2 carbons from glucose -> TCA -> oxidizd into CO2. 
- NADH + FADH2 all from TCA, going into e- to ETC, makes a lot of ATP. 

t==hird trimester - mother's hormonal, making more steady blood glucose thru the placenta==
- ==mom gets increased insulin resistance! due to this - **insulin and glucose will rise in bloodstream, so fetus will start storing more fuels as glycogen + fat in the liver**==
- in liver + skeletal muscle -> glycogen synthesis due to insulin 
- and more glucose, start conversion into fatty acids; palmitate synthesized ultimately stored in adipose tissue 
==note - insulin stimulates uptake in some tissues, but not the liver. **it's tissue specific bc the insulin responsive GLUT is only in adipose/ skeletal muscle tissue**==
- GLUT4 = the insulin responsive one! 
- otherwise GLUT2 is in the liver, and pancreatic beta cells specific transporter 
- ==when glucose comes in , it needs to get activated with **UDP glucose, phosporylated and converted to glucose 1 P -> UDP glucose, then glycogen synthase stimulated by glucose.**==
or the ==excess glucose can be converted to oxaloacetate and actyl coA -> citrate== ... 
- ==**citrate buildup = signals that we have enough energy, get's shuttled out into cytoplasm , put back into OAA + Acetyl coA, which will help make all those FATS**==
	- can make ==palmitate (acetyl coA carboxylase) -> **malonyl coA which shuts off beta oxidation**==
	- or ==acetyl coA can make cholesterol with HMG CoA reductase -> mevalonate -> cholesterol== 
when glucose goes into the cell it gets phosphorylated to trap it w ==hexokinase/glucokinase in liver/pancratic b cells== 

storage of fats - major form are triacylglycerols - synthesis of phosphatidate + diacylglycerol 3 phosphate is the first step in the synthesis of storage. 
- ==glycerol 3-phosphate + more phosphate groups== 
- ==glycerol phosphate acyltransferase== 
==then we remove a phosphate group and then add fatty acids.== 
==based on the phosphatidate molecules, recall we can add one more alcohol or different things to make different things like phosphatidyl choline etc. lung surfactant.== 
- if they don't express as much dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline -> respiratory distress syndrome

==endogenous transport of TAG as VLDL - cholesterol and the TAG both gets packed in the outer layer==
- ==apo B100 -> going to peripheral blood stream , picks up the apoE and ApoC2 (activates the LPL on capillary walls on the target tissues)==
- ==then the tAGs get broken into FAs , like in the adipose tissues breaking them up from it and storing them again.== 
- ==when it loses apoc2 -> IDL not VLDL==
- ==IDL will interact with hepatic triglyceride lipase, which depletes the rest of the triglycerides, which makes LDL.== 
- ==only exception LDL apo b100 will be interacting with LDL== 
recall that lipids can do anything... 

at birth, they have to feed intermittently and variety of fuel stores - figure out how to use your livers. 
- learning to use glucagon + epinephrine. 
- glucagon from pancreatic alpha cells from decreased insulins ; very high concentrations in the liver 
- when the cord clamps, glucose declined = more glucagon -> glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis + ketogenesis ; adipocytes will break out free fatty acids too bound to albumin 
- ==**skeletal muscle cells do not respond to the glucagon! from kid getting hungry** but they do respond to epinephrine!!!== 
	- ==glucagon + epinephrine both will make cAMP via their G protein signals.== 
	- ==break down of glycogen = phosphorylation cascade, eventually glucose gets released g-1P from the big glycogen -> isomerized into glucose 6 phosphate.== 
		- ==that glucose 6 phosphate is used in the muscles but in the liver we express glucose.6 phosphatase, which makes free glucose, which can maintain that homeostasis in the bloodstream again.== 
	- hormone sensitive lipase activated too. 
- ==normal sensor function = response to anoxia, stimulation, etc during birth -> epinephrine response as stress== 
recall - the glycogen is not a long term storage supply 

==in the neonate - **we have a harder time maintaining glucose homeostasis bc of smaller liver vs brain**- they have an enhanced capacity of using ketone bodies!!! from the breakdown of FAs==
- breakdown the fatty acids -> ketone bodies in the liver - **neonates use more ketone bodies**
==carnitine shuttle system will get long chain FAs from cytoplasm -> mt matrix where b-ox occurs.== 
- ==FA + coA -> activated form , and then get them into the carnitine exchange to get them into the shuttle== 
- ==exchange coA with carnitine with CPT I , the key enzyme for FA oxidation. inhibited by malonyl coA.== 
- ==carnitine acyl carnitine translocase will carry it in, and then reexchange for coa.== 
recall - cyclical process to ==beta oxidation = oxidation, hydration, oxidation, thiolysis== 
we also get FADH and NADH 
acyl coA dehydrogenases - have some diseases associated with it ... for medium chains recall MCAD. 

ketone body synthesis in neonate - from acetyl coA inside the mitochondria, goes thru rate lim enzyme ==**mitochondrial HMG coA synthase**==
- ==makes ketone bodies== 
- ==Acetoacetate, acetone, Î²-hydroxy- butyrate==
our brain can't use FA for energy, needs to use ketone bodies to keep larger brain functioning 
cytoplasmic form of HMG Coa Synthase - involved in cholesterol synthesis 

breast milk feeding! 
complex mixture of carbs, proteins, lipids. - made in the mom's alveolar cells of the mammilaries.
lactose = biggest carbs. 
- ==lactose synthase in the golgi membrane of the alveolar cells make **lactose from glucose, by getting Glucose 1 phosphate -> UDP glucose -> UDP galactose with epimerase + glucose => lactose** this all happens in mammary gland.==
==oligosaccharides of the milk - more of an immune role== 
==**major lipid component of breast milk - neonates get more lipids than the adult**==
proteins include caseins which are hard to digest. and secretory IgA will play an immune role too
![[lactose synthesis.png]]
fats come in -> put into chylomicrons , stored in adipose tissue
caseins broken into free amino acids in blood stream 
- no storage form for proteins

==lactose -> galactose + glucose monomers via lactase.== 
recall the long name for lactose - ==has a beta 1,4 linkage== 
if we have no lactase, we can have this go into large intestine -> gas and irritation with hypolactasia
==secondary lactase def -> results from infection like rotavius, celiac dz, crohn dz==
- breath test too. 
galactose metabolism 
==galactose -> converted into glucose 1-p + UDP glucose -> galactose 1 phosphate uridyl transferase will make it into UDP-galactose + glucose 1 phosphate (goal was to make this! for glycolysis) -> epimerase will make the UDP galactose into UDP glucose for the cycle again== 
net 2 ATP in glycolysis - same with the galactose + glucose 
should mom be feeding if infant has classic galactosemia? - **no! CI breastfeeding**
- basically that GALT enzyme is not there ; inability to convert galactose to glucose. 

fat components of breast milk
==foremilk - less fat , addresses thirst==
==hindmilk - more fat, addresses hunger== 
when milk go into stomach, gets digestion with lipase then small intestine 
- ==bile salts and the pancreatic lipases will help emulsify it and then lipases will get in and digest -> into triglycerides==
- **2 monoglycerols + fatty acids in the small intestine specifically. you leave the C2 fatty acids attached uniquely!**
	- ==the FA are pulled into small intestine epithelial cells, repackaged. then put into chylomicrons.== 
	- ==chylomicrons Apo b48 - gets apo e and apo C2 (activates LPL to degrade it into FA + glycerol)==
- ==after we have chylomicron remnants, apo E Exits bloodstream and go back to liver for processing== 
wordwall.net/resource/56714154 - apolipoprotein matching 
==![[apolipoprotein summary.png]]==

==LCAT - HDL maturation factor== 
==taggin exogenous particles = apo b48 like chylomicrons.== 
vast majority of the breast milk FA
- saturated with palmitic acid chains to the TGs
- dont memorize percentages, but just note the 2 polyunsaturated FAS
	- **linoleic acid + alpha linolenic acid**
	- essential - recall that linoleic delta 6 
	- and alpha linolenic delta 3 
	- remember we can't make any double bonds beyond the delta 9 position. (counting from that terminal carbon end)

protein components - we get the caseins / whey fraction that gets broken down 
- partially digested by pepsin in stomach 
- then trypsins and proteases will digest it in small intestine 
- oligopeptides -> aminopeptidase of the intestines in brush border, will turn into tri/dipeptides taken up by pepT1
- only free amino acids make it into the blood stream 
==essential amino acids are gonna be arg + cys for **infants + children!**==
know them in like a year but amino acid derivatives are needed to make any nitrogen ones like nucleotides. - several many derivatives 
surplus amino aid degredation
- remove amino group as urea excretion 
- carbon skeleton - break down skeleton alpha keto acid - each aa has its own way of getting broken down 
==methionine== 
- ==all do transmination step then we get oxidative deamination and then urea cycle with extra nitrogen.== 
- ==urea cycle - process ammonia thru 5 enzymes== - **we need to know these!! all screened for in newborn panel!! so many diseases associated with these**

==![[urea cycle.png]]==

carbon skeletons - some are ketogenic, others are glucogenic 
lots are both 
- know leucine + lysine as specifically ketogenic bc used as therapies. 

==catabolism methionine - does NOT follow that transamination step - super important bc makes SAM the methyl carrier.== 
==![[methionine catabolism.png]]==
==homocysteine can make the alpha ketobutyrate + cysteine (meaning for adults, it's nonessential but for neonates we just need more of that)==

homocysteiene metabolism pixorize![[methionine pixorize.png]]
B6 - palpation with a 6 of pyramid 

phenylalanine + tyrosine degradation needs to know 
==![[phe tyrosine metabolism.png]]==
==we need to know phenylalanine hydroxylase + fumarylacetonacetate hydrolase bc these are screened of== 
- ==PKU + tyrosemia type 1== 
- ==remember homogentisate oxidase = usually less severe; called alkaptinuria.== 

branched chain AAs. - VAl ILE LEU
==all branched chain AAs will be processed by branched chain alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase.== 
- ==recall that valine gets to go to proponyl coa -> gluconeogenic== 
- ==leucine + isoleucine is ketogenic ; makes acetyl coa==
- ==maple syrup disease is a big thing bc the enzyme has many parts== 
- cofactors for branched chain alpha keto acid dehydrogenase = 
	- thiamine pyrophosphate , lipo 8 fatty acid , NAD niacin, FAD riboflavin , CoA panthothenic acid. 

starts solid foods in like 6 months
- ==have fructose coming in @ 6 mos== 
- ==enters the glycolysis as DHAP + G3P== 
- can be slowly phosphorylated by hexokinase (not in liver), makes fructose 6 phsphate
- ==extra enzymes = fructokinase -> fructose 1 phosphate, then it will split in half by fructose 1 phosphate aldolase -> DHAP + glyceraldehyde (which turns into G3P via phosphorylation)==
	- ==we skip that phosphofructose kinase step that's usually impacted by insulin== 
	- bc of that, it can cause issues w high fructose corn syrup 
2 disases
- ==essential fructosuria - fructokinase def  - benign - can end up with more fructose in urine== 
- ==hereditary fructose intolerance- aldolase B AKA fructose 1 phosphate aldolase = **we cann't process that fructose from fructose 1 phosphate!!!**==
	- bc of that cells lose that phosphate via fructokinase making fructose 1 phosphate 
		hugeee energy sink - jaundie, vomitting, poor feeding etc. 

neonatal diabetes mellitus - rare condiition 
==MODY2 = glucokinase - pancreatic beta cells cannot sense glucose levels, no insulin release!== 
basically mutations in this pathway leads to any diabetes ![[MODY insulin secretion path.png]]![[RL enzymes metabolic Summary.png]]
