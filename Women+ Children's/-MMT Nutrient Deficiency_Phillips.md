#womenchild 
essentials - cannot be synthesized for body 
==vitamins - org req for normal metabolism, exceptions of vita d, cannot synthesize== 
ACDEK - ca, fiber, K+, mg, and choline, esp vita D = all are under consumed in our diet. 
vitamin D - deficient, about 10%, majority are nonhispanic black population 
also iron bc menstruation 

why we care - USMLE - vitamin deficiencies/toxicities are asked mainly 
minerals, vita, aa, all we need. we don't have to memorize the list of everything. 

B vitamin deficiencies - usually good indicators of it, tongue, mainly with alcohol related stuff. 
corkscrew hairs of some scurvy 
==![[fat soluble vita toxicity.png]]==
==water soluble vitamins - B + C== 
- ==directly into blood, travel free, circulate free, kidneys excrete, possible to go toxic levels when consumed, needed frequently== 
fat soluble ADEK - 
- into lymph then blood, req transport proteins
- less readily excreted, going into fat sites
- more likely to toxic. needed in periodic doses. 

kwashiorkor - diet has calories, but low proteins - more severe than marasmus. edema 
- abdomen distension ; shiny skin too. 

nutritional dwarfism - normal moods, normal weight for height.

pallor 
65 yo women, lost 10 lbs over 6 months, ==thumbnail changes, brittleness, pale, nail has a scoop in the center "koilonychia", hypochromic microcytic anemias = **iron def**==
- pallor + spoon nail koilonychia 
- hypochromic microcytic anemias 
- blood loss? additional studies to confirm suspected def and id root cause 
- alopecia, atrophy ,  
==plummer-vinson syndrome: triad of microcytic hypo-chromic anemia (iron deficiency), atrophic glossitis and esophageal webs/dysphagia==
- microcytic hypochromic anemia 
- atrophic glossitis
- esophageal webs = dysphagia 

---
muscle aches 
62, muscle aches, difficulty walking, less bone marrow density 
==vitamin d - best determined by measuring serum 25OHD== ... basically higher than 32 ng/ml = ==vitamin d is necessary for ca absorption... knowing levels is unnecessary just know risks== 
- ==deficiency = rickets + osteomalacia in adults==
	- rickets - overgrowth of epiphyseal cartilage , pigeon breast , bone deformity 
- ==dx osteoporosis done when there's other bone dz ruled out.== 
- t score less than -2.5 for that. 
- ==high risk in dark skinned kids of the north , not absorbing enough of the sunlight== 
celiac dz, bariatric surg, CF, IBDs et 

==active form: 1,25 OHD... **converted to this in the kidneys, from 25-OH-d**==

---
swollen neck 
- weight gain, constipation, cold weather
- goiter - some hypothyroid 
- ==iodine deficiency = high hypothyroidism, goiter.== 
- not as common here.. maternal def -> fetal def. 
- abortions, cretinism + dwarfism etc. 

---
GI disturbance 
- isoniazid for tb , causing disturbance, irritability + sadness 
- vitamin b deficiency... 
- ==corn - B deficiency - more likely== 
==pellagra - **chronic lack of b3 niacin... complication of isoniazid therapy, and ppl who get food from maize commonly affected**==
- ==4Ds - photosensitive derm, diarrhea, dementia, death==
- skin changes never itchy 
- early signs glossitis, vaginitis, vetigo, stomatitis 

---
rash 
70 yo rash, many cancers etc limits intake of fruits + veg 
normal platelet count 
==vitamin c - scurvy - peri-follicular hemorrhage = skin breakouts - fatigue, ct weakness + cappillary fragility+curled hairs+depression, scurvey== 
- fatigue, depression, scurvy - curled hairs. 
- gums = irritation + bleeding 

 ---
 remote gastrectomy 
 - shiny glossitis atrophic tho; consider folate but think of b12 
 - hemoglobin is 10, blood smear - we see a multinucleated cell. 
 - B12 -  ... deficiency - think of that as a possibility. 
	 - anisocytosis, macrocytosis/ovalocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils = **megaloblastic anemia**
		 - enlarged rbc + hyperlobulated neutrophils 
	 - b12 most likely cause 
	 - vision issues + gait disturbances + etc = can become permanent ): 
==cobalamin - megaloblastic anemia, atrophic glossitis, **myelin degen of spinal cord! paranoid, delirium, loss of position**==
- after treatment - loss of gastric mucosa... 

---
dry eyes
==frothy accumulation on eye - **widow spot** = vitamin A def, stored in liver, affected by all fat absorption, night blindness dry eyes== 
- dry eyes, bittot spots, blindness, 50-80% = stored in the liver... 
- affected by all fat absorption 
- night blindness, etc. 

---
==diarrhea + rash - persistent diarrhea + hair falling out  = zinc deficiency, anorexia, impaired wound healing==
- think of Child abuse 
metabolic disorder causing **zinc deficiency** - acrodermatitis enteropathica
- breast milk usually provides enough but it's different 
- anorexia 
- impaired wound healing, hypogonad, impaired night vision 

---
sore mouth - red lesion at corner
==B2 - riboflavin - chilosis on the edge of mouth - think of this + glossitis, eye changing, scaling dermatitis== 

---
==altered mental status - maxillary bodies are affected - think **wenicke's encephalopathy - thiamine deficiency results in this** ... most common - beriberi ;; chronic alc .... dry beriberi = polyneuropathy ;; wet = edema + heart failure== 
wenicke korsakoff - death, death of mammillary bodies 

---
iron stain - anemia 
- ==B6 + copper deficiency... - **sideroblastic anemia** = think this whenever you have a B6 deficiency==
- cu def is rare but seen with anoter 
- lots of blue in the bone marrow scan 
- b6 = big tongue, common in chronic alc + preganancy 
- resembles b12 and niacin but think sideroblastic anemia 
---
neural tube defects -folate deficiency for sure. 
==vita K = ez bruising, nosebleeds, oozing instead of clotting blood over.== 
ca = osteomalacia, tetany, arrhythmias are all seen 
biotin - cause rare stuff - hair skin, etc can look like abuse.
