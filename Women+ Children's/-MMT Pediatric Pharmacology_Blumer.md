Prototype drugs: No specific drugs (several examples are discussed)
**we need to know - dosing errors are HUGE for pediatrics patients!**
don't memorize the drug names in the eample drugs - but memorize the PK implications panels in the summary sheet. 

==$ !!! Greater pharmacokinetic variability in pediatric pts - just mostly focus on this!== 
1. ==Absorption: ↑ gastric pH, delayed gastric emptying== 
2. ==Distribution: ↑ total body water, decreased plasma protein binding== 
3. ==Metabolism: ↓ phase I & II enzyme activity in neonates; ∆’s w/ age== 
4. ==Excretion: ↓ GFR & tubular secretion in neonates; ↑ w/ age==

sulfanilamide elixirs - GOLDMARK - ethylene glycol 
==sulfonamides, ethyelene glycol of GOLDMARK - can give rise to kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy), where bilirubin is displaced from plasma and go to the brain==
- drugs displace bilirubin from binding sites in plasma, elevations in it can travel to the brain. 
==Chloramphenicol  - babies don't have the enzymes that can add on the sugars, causes *grey baby syndrome* from deficient glucoronidation==
thalidomide - phocomelia 

research is challenging - hard to enroll peds pts - many of these meds for peds - 25% are off label, not FdA approved for them. 
- ==adult dosing = based on body weight.... but we cannot do that for kids due to differences in organ system dev. very little data about the safety and data of this== 
- ethical issues in enrolling them into clinical trials
	- consent of parents + pt 
	- safety? minimal risk? how much blood draws -> too frequent = impact. 
	- sample collection? 
- NIH opened this funding to get this data - **developmental pharmacokinetics.** 
biggest thing - **developmental+physiological differences in peds pts and how that can afect pharmacokinetics + drug therapy**
- how might it change over time? how do these organ systems mature and when is it equivalent to an adults? 
---
absorption - how much into systemic circualtion?
- ==IM or SQ administration - remember that muscles in infants preterms is minimal so avoid IM unless in emergencies==
	- avoid but not exclude IM administration in neonates. - only for emergencies
- ==percutaneous absorption - **increased due to underdeveloped epidermal barrier, accessible but at risk of toxicity** - topical corticosteroids== 
	- basically salves and creams are sooo common esp with corticosteroids... 
	- se - skin atrophy, hypopigmentation, hypothalamic pituitary axis suppression etc. don't memorize, just kno that some are very potent. 

GI tract - 
- pH - higher than that of adults, at birth. then ==the acid secretion begins soon after birth - pH 1-3 in 24 hours, in premies more slow.== 
- in preterms - this occurs more slow, lowering of the gastric pH is in several days 
	- ==higher pH = higher serum concentrations of acid labile drugs liek nafcillin== 

- ==delayed gastric emptying - prolonged 24-48 hrs, will be slow in prematures so increased absorption== 
	- prolonged = increased drug absorption 
---
distribution - think of body comp + plasma protein binding
body comp - neonates = **higher total body water compared to adults**
- ==bc of more water , administer MORE than usual water soluble drugs like **aminoglycosides, which has much higher distribution**, give higher loading dose.== 
	- loading dose = increase that relatively speaking because of that higher total water content. particularly in premies 

==protein binding - expression is generally LOWer in infants... total drug binding capacity is lower. so rise in free drug toxicity like in *acidic drugs like NSAIDs or lipophilic drugs*== 
- potential for increase in free drug. = risk in toxicity goes up .... binding poorly to acidic drugs like NSAIDS
- increased competition for these sites by bilirubin + other drugs - **some can displace bilirubin = kernicterus = ceftriaxone avoided in first 2 months and sulfa drugs avoided**
- higher unbound drugs that are typically protein bound like highly lipophilic drugs = affecting drug bioavailability and results in toxicities 
overall - increase in free drug
- greater ability to bind receptors
- inc pharm effects + SE at lower doses

*==total body fat = lower. = issue for lipid soluble drugs==*

==drugs distributed in breast milk - causes neonatal exposure. most drugs do pass but not sufficient enough concentration... note but CNS drugs aree often lipid soluble and accumulate.== 
- many drugs for CNS are lipid soluble - can accumulate in breast milk causing toxicity when breastfeeding infants
---
metabolism 
early in life with premies tooo - when drug metabolizing enzyme expression = lower, liver's not mature yet. they have potential to accumulate bc less enzymes
- true for phase 1 and 2 enzymes , most drugs have longer halflives. 
- ==**many enzymes reach near-adult levels in the first year**==

drugs that are like glucoronidated - cannot do that as well = causes grey baby syndrome
==bilirubin also eliminated by glucoronide conugation by UGT1A1, goes up, kernicterus AS WELL! = encephalopathy== 
- both metabolism (lack of UGT1A1) and lack of protein binding causes kernicterus 

theophylline v caffeine - 
- ==theophylline - in the past used to treat apnea of prematurity - stimulates respiration, A1 and A2a antagonist, indirect adrenergic agonists, inhibits cAMP phosphoodiesterase==
	- ==eliminated thru renal excretions + expression of metabolizing enzymes is huge== 
	- ==decreased kidney functions w neonats + poor. metabolism = theophylline toxicity== 
- ==caffeine = related to it, more safe. but very long half life==

==however - children have higher metabolic rates between 1-2 years... and can be faster than adults - **they decrease over tiem to adult levels**==
- for toddlers - an increase in dose / decrease in dosing interval might be needed. 
---
elimination 
GFR is very low in neonates + infants - can take several weeks to a year. 
- be careful with renal elimination  - much lower daily doses of most drugs, increasing with age, like penicillins 
==**toddlers have higher GFR than adults = require increased drug doses**==

---
calculating doses for adolescents + large children = check the label to see if this is for adults, children, infants? they have max single doses labeled. 

weight based oral dosing - mainly for parents
- twice daily is more convenient than 3/4 doses a day 
- ease of measurement - whole numbers = more accurate 
- volume per dose - smaller vol = better tolerated by some kids, but smaller volumes **are more prone to inaccurate dosing**

==most drugs would have mg/kg - in pediatric doses - but **this assumes linear relationship between weight + dose, NOT always accurate**; nonlinear relationships establish how a dose relates to body weight== 
other methods = based on age... but not huge
- ==$ !!!!! **on the test - we will be dosing based on surface area BSA = more likely to be adequate + accurate** but in reality we'd be dosing based on mg/kg== 
med errors = commonly stem from multiple calculations errors. 
- wrong dose, wrong technique and wrong drug = most common med errors. 
most patients of this population can't effectively communicate adverse drug rxns 
---
toxicities
==Anticholinergic toxidromes - big, hot, dry fast - associated with atropine/oxybutynin but more common in other meds.== 
- think benadril etc antipsychotics. 
==cholinergic toxidromes - SLUDGE - BBB bradycardia, bronchospasms, etc.== 
sedative hypnotics - sedations, apnea, brady 
==sympathomimetics - tachy, diaphoresis, mydriasis, agitation/seizures==
==opiods - resp depression, sedation, brady== 
diabetes meds - hypoglycemia

example notes - Ceftriaxone - only bilirubin kernicterus - neonates
SSRIs - black box warning in peds - suicidal ideation ? but we do need to treat adolescents for depression but be mindful of the effects that can cause suicidal ideation;

---
routinely given to newborns
- IM vitamin K = prevent hemorrhagic ddz 
- topical erythromycin gonococcal conjunctivitis
- hep b vaccine 



FYI - trends in prescription med use in peds
- 0-23 mon - antibx, asthma, topicals
- 2-5 yrs - antibx, asthma, topical, antihistamines 
- 6-11 yrs - adhd, topicals, antihistamines, antibx
there's been decrease in prescription of antibx in stewardship + antihistamines (overuse, no effect in viral URIs)
use of asthma + ADHD increased.
