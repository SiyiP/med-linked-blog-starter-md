lack of statistics - carefully present it , but a lot of moving pieces here!!
many individuals - healthy ppl initiative 1979 - set 10 yrs in advance , setting goals from then ... now we're at 2030. american academy of pediatrics aligns with all this 
https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/about/timeline
why is breast feeding the best nutritional choice? - protection against acute ear infection, diarrhea + vomiting, hospitalization for lower resp tract dz, necrotizing enterocolitis w premies. 
also keep track of  https://www.ahrq.gov - where's the information coming from? economic impact and goals for healthyppl. its been cut more ): 

AAP: 
- ==exclusive breast fed for 6 mon== 
- ==6-12 month still breastfed w gradual intro solids== 
- ==benefits breastfeeding beyond 1 yr== 
- premies should be breastfed directly or by using expressed milk. also banked human milk should be used in human milk banks. 
- skin to skin contact for premies

OMB - office of management + budget - create the standard for how we sort all data in the country like defining - 
- standards for data 
- racial/ethnic groups for data collection, surveys, sensus, programing
- updated after 2 yr review, 2024 - came out with SPD 15... 
- requires implementation by mar 2029 
- https://www.census.gov/about/our-research/race-ethnicity/standards-updates.html 
Asian - not include Pacific islander 
black africans separate from middle eastern/north african 
pacific islanders =are its own group now. yay 

ppl eligible for WIC = least apt to breastfeed. - 
no GED etc - less apt to breastfeed. also young moms too. 
- many people will not breastfeed - plenty of kids raised on formula only. but - 
- highest amt of ppl feel inconvenience to lifestyle. 
- hospital practices - separation of mom and newborn. + public disregard against breastfeeding ): 
- remember lactation issues need to be understood + recognized. 
ppl who need to go back to works + environments that aren't conducive for collecting - mothers who have low income hard jobs
when budgets are made, goes to house then to the senate. then sequestration to see how we can pass in both. 

as of mar 28 - we would be able to give WIC support for this type f formula + maternal health. avg mom - getting check of 52$ ): and each child is 25$
- big beautiful bill - **cut of 350$ to WIC at reducing fresh fruit + alter ability to supplement for formula.**

**contraindications to breastfeeding**
- infants w classic galactosemia
- moms w active tb dz or poz t cell lymphotropic viral infections 
- moms getting radiation therapies 
- resource - CI drugs: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/?report=classic ; lactmed - put it on your phone! 
- recreational drugs
- active HSV lesions 
- moms with HIV - ART treated moms - <1% transmission rate 
	- highest transmission rate = with moms who use BOTH formula + breastfeeding - **interestingly enough the formula can adversely impact the gut to allow more virus permeability.**
- alc, nicotine, caffeiene.

development of the fetal gut 
==phase 1 embryonic phase of organogenesis - conception - 5 wks== 
==primitive gut is a cord of cells== 

==phase 2 rapid growth + differentiation==  
==gut tube w/ lumen + movement of fluid!! lumen opens.== 
==elongation, dev of crypts, villi, microvilli, swallowing of amniotic fluid,== 
==blockage of amniotic fluid flow inhibits development !== 

==phase 3 - active diff - from late gestation to *early feeding @ birth*== 
- ==increase mitotic activity + increased apoptosis== 
- ==developmental remodeling in anticipation of feeding== 
- ==switching from amniotic fluid in the gut to human milk if possible== 

==phase 4+5 rapid growth + differentiation== 
- ==clustered - after enteral feeding begins + continue thru late infancy== 
- ==deepen crypts, widening villi, futher maturation== 
- ==antigen load increases. so innate + specific aq immunity develops== 
==baby goes thru phase 1-3 before birth ... basically amniotic fluid is providing 15% of fetal nutritional requirements + **growth factors**==
then human milk gives all the nutritional req post birth w/ growth factors 

==if infant born prematurely... does not shift the phases of development, just means we need to make sure they develop outside of womb== 
- ==no amniotic fluid growth factors, **but the human milk can make up for lack of growth factors...** the issue w/ formula is that it lacks these.== 

components of amniotic fluid - proteins, carbs, lipids/phospholipids, urea.electrolytes, and all these are secreted by those cells lining the amniotic sac. 
growth factors of amniotic fluid
Receptor tyrosine kinases - 
==• Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) - maturation and repair of the intestines  -  this will increase with advancing gesttational age, but works better in synergy with the rest.==
	this will increase during pregnancy 
	EGF levels highest in first few days post-parturition 
	inside breast milk gradually decrease during first month of lactation 
	but infant's salivary EGF increaes with gestational + post natal age.
	==**EGF lvls in milk of moms w/ very preterm infants are SUPER HIGH!!** - ur body knows you need to make more==  
==• Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) - tissue growth==
• Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) 
==• Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) -tissue growth==
==• Transforming Growth Factor α (TGF-α) - maturation and repair of the intestines== 
• Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor (HB-EGF)
==JAK-STAT Receptors== 
• ==Interleukins (IL)== 
==• Human Growth Factor==
==• erythropoeitin - epo - Erythropoesis intestinal dev==  

transition to breast milk growth factors. - easy bc same thing!!! 
==GCPRs too = somatostatin + calcitronin - growth regulation + neuronal dev of GI== 

==EGF receptors will bind EGF, Hb-EGF, TGF-alpha  - essential - to express occludin + claudin to stop the leakiness of the gut - **tight junctions for the gut barrier**==
- expression of ==math1 - central line for **goblet cells, enteroendocrine + paneth cell maturity**==
- ==antiapoptotic pathways== 
- ==downreg - proinflammatory cytokines== 

==necrotizing enterocolitis - in 1/10 low birth weight individuals - more often with formula fed ppl== 
- cause is ==unknown, variable, bacterial infection of the leaky gut== 
- barrier is incomplete, and bacteria colonizes the gut. 
- ==toxic shock like thing - takes blood to the heart, away from the GI tract, hypoxic death of GI tract - necrosis in the colon.== 

human milk protein comp - less proteins in human milk; 7.5 g 
- whey soluble 70-80% = includes Ig, growth factors, lactalbumin alpha with no allergic responses. 
	- better for rapid gastric emptying 
	- ==plasma taurine + cysteine are higher - so better **bile conjugation + antioxidant synthesis** in human milk==
	- lower amino acids that are bad for brain dev - phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine 
- lower insoluble casein , 20-30%. 
in cow's milk, most of it is casein 82% and the whey in it is beta-lactoglobulin which is more allergenic. 
- 24.7 g 

==if the infant takes up more protein, like more than 11.0 g (FDA formula standards), we will have **solute load in kidney** - so the filtrate will invoke an early rush of water into lumen - **loss of water!!** -> infant dehydration via too much protein from cow's milk== 

lipids in human milk - 50% of calories, packaged as TGs already, very long chain FA, arachidonic acid + DHA(brain development. - all derived from linoleic + linolenic acids
- more easily hydrolyzed, enhance absorption 
- also has much lipases
- packed as some milk fat globules for stabilized + compartmentalized fashion, rate control release. 
==in formulas - more MCFA vs more lipids in VLCFA packaged as TGs already.... hard to duplicate total lipid content== 
- ==adding DHA though is helpful with brain development even when you're giving formulas.== 

milk carbohydrates
 - primarily lactose -> galactose + glucose
 - small oligosaccharides - immune properties + nutritional effects
 - ==benefits - lactase is in your gut from the beginning so the human milk .== 
	 - ==**oligosaccharides prevent antigens from attaching to gut epithelium!!**== 
	 - ==support growth of lactobaccillus bifidus, **increases acidity to compensate for low production of HCl**==
disadvantage of having formula - excessive soy in it, excessive carbs. 

minerals - 
==breast milk - ca and phosphates lower + iron + zn decline during lactation== 
- ==but absorption are facilitate by its binding to digestible proteins== 
- ==lactoferrin in human milk - **binds iron molecules to help absorption**==
 at 6 mon - iron + other nutrients **should be supplemented though**

maternal status- affects content of vitamins in human milk 
- ==**low in vitamin D... with increasing vita D deficiency in moms, uptick in rickets in babies!** recommend vitamin D3.== 
- ==low vitamin K content too in human milk. please give after birth to prevent hemorrhagic dz==
- vegans must supplement with **water soluble** B12 
==colostrum - immature breast milk, still has cells==
- ==neutrophils==
- ==some lymphcytes==
- ==sIgA + IgG==
==mature breast milk - has== 
- ==80%+ macrophages, activated,== 
- ==capable of making 12+ growth factors + cytokines== 
- we remain immunologically active giving passive immunity until they build active immunity 
neonatal gut - colonized by environmental bacteria within 12 hrs after birth - naive and incompetent immune system , b cells do not build memory cells
- gut mucosal cells lack tight junctions, so more easy penetration of bacteria. 

goals for 2020 outcomes - pretty miraculous good jumps up in breastfeeding (: 
but disparities unfortunately persisted ): 
work site stuff - exceeded a good lactation support goal 
- our state is actually a high performer in this baby facility friendliness goal! 
hospital initiative standards - 10 steps to successful breastfeeding is enacted! + marketing of breast milk substitutes are stopped as much!
to become a baby friendly hospital we need to meet these standards. 
22 hospitals in south carolina. we're doing well in this! 

ACA - laws help mom's out - covering hourly wage ppl time and space for breast feeding - break time without compensation to express milk for 1 yr. 
a place other than batheroom shielded from view. 
health insurance benefits too. 28 states passed legislation for workplace lactation (: 
however - there's been a repeal of ACA - this is something that would be threatened - and any protections are left up to the states!!!! any states with no legislation will be leaving moms high and dry. 

South Carolina milk bank - funded this, sickest low birth babies are here.

what was the impetus of the opposition breast feeding resolution by the US in the WHO? 
- lobbying from formula feeding companies. it's.a very strong lobby , supported by the FDA. be aware of this. monopoly 
all objectives are completely dropped about breast feeding from the 2030 plans ): removed the ppl about newborn hospital breastfeeding setups
- mainly professional women who felt ostracized , many who were physicians 

covid 19 - reduction of reporting from the CDC in terms of breastfeeding. 
- we don't know if pregnant mom with covid can pass to baby - no data
- can touch and hold baby if they're infected. and they can still breastfeed. 
maternal milk - transfer the antibody but not the antigen/virus! IgA and IgG are there and specific for COVID = might be very beneficial. 

formula crisis 2022 - 4 companies control the industry - abbott, mead johnson, nestle, perrio. 
- supply change issues + abbott loss. 
- strict import restrictions - protection of american producers. 
- FDA restrict import of european formulas even tho some exceed the nutritional reqs. 
- WIC - major contractor of it - creating a monopoly. 
most felt by low SE groups + lowest incidence of feeding )): ppl tried to make their own formula. 

what's changed? - ==2 suppliers make up most of the dollars for infant formula. fucked up== 
- ==no we didn't solve the problem - **WIC doesnt allow parental choice!**==
- we still don't allow for other country alternate formulas
- FDA lacks resources to investigate + approve new companies. 
so the problem is NOT resolved. and it can happen again. 
inability to breastfeed - should be open minded to that.
