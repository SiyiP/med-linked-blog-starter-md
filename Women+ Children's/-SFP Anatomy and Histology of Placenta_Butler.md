typically placenta is on the upper wall of uterus - amniotic sac will encapsulate it in amniotic fluid. 
Four main functions: 
1. Provide nourishment – provides essential nutrients and eliminates waste product 
2. Gas exchange: functions as fetal lung 
3. Protection: protects against mechanical trauma and provides immune protection for fetus - There's this inflammatory protection against the mom's immune system 
4. Endocrine: produces essential hormones for fetal development - like hcg by syncytiotrophoblasts 
o2 rich blood, nutrients, antibodies, dugs go from mom to fetus and co2, waste, fetal cells go back to her (all this stuff drain to the umbilical cord)
at the most distal tips of that villi tree, we have terminal bulging capillaries 

 ![[villous tree to umbilical to maternal.png]]
distal chorionic villi - the capillary has fused w/ the basement membrane of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast, which will have fetal blood. and then maternal blood just on the other side, meaning that barrier between the two are reduced and small. - we don't want any mixing of blood 
morula on day 4 after fertilization has an influx of fluid which pushes stuff apart, and then we have an inner cell mass = blastocyst layer 
==day 5-7== 
- apposition - 
- ==adhesion of blastocyst into the lining, we will have some differentiation the outer cell mass or trophoblast into== 
	- ==inner cytotrophoblast - primitive mononuc cells, germinal cells for syncytium to be stem cells==
	- ==outer syncytiotrophoblast = no individual cells, no cell borders but multinuc giant cells, invasive capable of going into uterine epithelium + **endocrine organ** like HCG== 
		- ==this will invade into the endometrium==
		- ==eventually makes lacunae that **eventually become intervillous space**==
		- ==then we get pillars and radial growth of the cyncytotrophoblast invading.== 
==secondary chorionic villi - with extraembryonic mesoderm from chorionic cavity growing into trabeculae (originally they were from cytotrophoblast) -> connective tissue + bv in 2 weeks== 
==tertiary/mesenchymal chorionic villi - fetal capillaries in 18-20 days== 

==extraembryonic somatic mesoderm invasion becomes the chorionic plate, making that connecting stalk also the umbilical cord post invasion and formation of artery and vein.== 
==connects that fetal architecture with the decidua.== 
early pregnany - embryo and developping placenta - composed out outer and inner syncytiotrophoblast layer. 
- ==extravillous trohpoblasts base will b connecting mom and child== 
==recall - the myometrial arteries -> arcuate -> straight and spiral arteries ; **the embryo implants in the functionalis layer, with the spiral arteries**==
==decidua - thick layer of modded mucous membrane lining uterus during pregnancy, shed after birth== 
- ==looks like plump + pale cyt **filled with glycogen(nutrients)** + relation with invading trophoblast seemingly defies laws of transplantation immunology== 
- when the extravillous trophoblasts invae decidua, we have invasion of spiral arteries that get remodded to make them more dilated. **extravillous trophoblasts originally plug the vessels to stop it, and then it'll get taken out, and end up with huge funnels** which replaces the smooth muscles inside 
decidual vessels have no more SM bc we don't want the mom's htn to affect blood not getting to embryo 
- also we make a high pressure low capacitance syndrome, so it'll only shoot out to one area like a strong hose, making hypoxic areas instead of a smoother spread! 
==how to connect the 2 circuits of fetal + maternal blood==
- ==early 1/2nd trimester placenta - bulbous big and not much architecture + thick , essentially 4 layers. out to in = syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, mesenchyme, vascular endothelium of fetal capillary== 
	- blood travels thru 4 layers to get into the capiclllaries 
- later we have terminal villi which will regress to see the syncytiotrophoblast just that with the capillaries. 
==early pregnancy - try to set up the skeleton of the villi tree - so we set up ith trophoblastic sprouts of the villus, then the stem villi== 
stem villi - set up the architecture of it all 
==![[tertiary immature intermed stem villi.png]]==

3rd trimester - develop present midgestation + long and slender, giving off the mature terminal villi of all that exchange. 
!![[villus tree placenta branching.png]]
smaller and smaller branching from the umbilical cord to the terminal villous 

i==mmature v mature villi== 
- ==immature - large bulbous, continuous, loos myxoid stroma, central capillaries w no membranes,== 
- ==mature = small mostly capillaries, noncontinuous layer w regression of cytotrophoblasts + mounding of syncytiotrophoblast, collagenized stroma, peripheral capillaries== 
small terminal villi w vasculosyncytial membranes = fused with basement membranes etc reduce th distance of blood
fetal components - extraplacental Membranes – Amnion & Chorion • Chorionic Plate • Villi
maternal components - decidua + intervillous space 
surface of placenta = chorionic plate 
basal layer = maternal surface, insertion into uterine wall 

==umbilical cord - tan gray twisting and coils - 2 pair arteries from the deox blood to the placenta==
==veins taking oxygenate nutrients etc to the fetus== 
- ==lined by amniotic epithelium, composed of **wharton's substance**, lots of GAGs, macrophages, abundant water for flexibility!== 
extraplacental membranes encase the fetus, contains amnionic fluid - composed of amnion, chorion, decidua. stretchy bc they're connective tissue 
==amnion - layer closest to the aminionic fluid + fetus , cuboidal epithelium== 
==chorion - layer of CT overlaying a basement membrane + extravillous trophoblasts== 
==decidua - composed of decidual stromal cells, a, v== 
Extraplacental membranes: 
![[amnion to decidua layers.png]]
==decidua basalis - has the spiral arteries at the base providing to the fetus?== 
==decidual capsularis - the capsule over the sac==
==decidual parietalis - will make the capsularis and stuff fuse, making the **decidua vera**== 
==chorionic plate - top of placenta, umbilical cord inserting into th surface of placenta, and then cord transcected. composed of amnion and chorion== 
surface -has amnion + CT, spongey layer that splits, and big muscular vessels that branch into stem vessels 

basal layer - maternal surface - lobular units are there, beefy red 
has decidua functionalis, and vessels, fibrin, and extravillous trophoblasts. also has some spiral arteries. 
chorionic villi + intervillous space - where exchange occurs, very red and spongey and bloody 

In utero, the placenta serves as the site of gas exchange, nutrient absorption, and waste elimination. 
In a relative short life span the placenta undergoes rapid growth, differentiation and maturation. The mature placenta is a discoid organ consisting of an elaborately branched fetal villous tree that is bathed by maternal blood.
Extravillous trophoblasts are responsible for invasion of the endomyometrium and for physiologic conversion of the spiral arteries. Many complications of pregnancy are associated with defects in extravillous trophoblast invasion and failure to establish the maternal circulation correctly. 
The terminal villi are the primary site of fetomaternal exchange. Development of the placenta throughout pregnancy leads to progressive enlargement of the surface area for exchange and reduction in the mean diffusion distance between the maternal and fetal circulations

development from implantation to term 
fetal blood doesnt directly contact maternal one, protecting from microorgs. 
implantation of blastocyst (2 layers of trophoblast which makes placenta, and embryoblast making embryo, amnion, umbilical cord+mesenchyme to placenta)
trophoblasts at embryoblast pole -> double layer, inner cytotrophoblast are stem cells from syncytiotrophoblast (outer layer, makes many hormones, exchange too)
day 8 post coitus - 12 we make holes lacunar state of development that emerge as it also grows 
- invasion is by cytotrophoblast cells by primary villi, which spreads down to the end of the syncytiotrophoblast making a shell of trophoblast 
- on the shell they anchor 
then extraembryonic mesenchyme will make secondary villi and eventually the chorionic plate 
basal plate - site where decidua basalis of mother contacts the trophoblast. 
the cells continue to break thru the cell, invading tissue as extra villus cytotrophoblasts
- initially they block the spiral arteries as **endovascular** trophoblasts, driving angiogenesis of villi + protect villi and embryo from inury 
- later extravillous cytotrophoblasts become interstitial trohpoblasts replace muscular arterial walls with fibrinoid **dilating spiral vessel walls**
week 5 Post menstruation - inside secondary villi, we get angiogenesis -> tertiary / mesenchymal villi develop inside tertiary villi, fusing w trunk of chorionic plate 
7th wweek - mesenchymal villi develop more into immature intermediate villi which will tree branch 
- then vessels develop in the mesenchyme 
- in the third trimester, long slender immature villi make terminal ones, then capillaries will start to bulge and curl from the wall , **a lot of surface area for exchange**
- then the full villus tree will have stem villi (architectural support) and mature intermediate villi which make terminal villi 
maternal blood will enter intervillous space via spiral arteries, which will contact terminal villi 
- o2 go thru syncytiotrophoblast layer then widely spaced cytotrophoblast into the circulation.
