==mammary gland - exocrine gland - gland that develops from an epithelal downgrowth into the mesenchyme==
- has a secretory portion, and the connection to the surface is maintained 
as early as 4 weeks, we already see the epithelial downgrown , which will go down. 
while the ectoderm makes the perenchyma, there's a lot of specialization of the mesoderm makes the CT and the stroma of the tissue. 
- importance of mesenchyme specialization needs to be noted 

==fully mature female breast - a compound tubuloacinar gland==
- ==compound - branching duct system== 
- ==secretory structures are tubules capped with acini.== 

==embryo to birth - dev of ducts + nipple - we should b able to locate the mammary gland by birth== 
- developmental genes, transc factors + growth factors -> impact the glands + mesenchyme to gt the location and the setup 
- ==puberty. - ducts elongate + branch further - type of hormones== 
	- ==circulating T -> regression fo breasts==
	- ==estrogen - terminal end ducts develop!; but the pregnancy + childbirth will cause secretory== 
	- menopause - breast regresses

==embryo 4-6 wks - mammary line develops by 4 wk, from axilla to the groin bilaterally - thickening of ectoderm + interaction with the mesoderm below.== 
- in animals, we get more and more nipples or mammaries goign down that area bc of that! 
- ==humans only in pectoral region preferentially due to temporal expression.== 
- by 6 wk, species specific differencies - **human gets mammary buds**

==somites - secrete fibroblast growth factor FGF, activates overlying ectoderm to express WNT -> causes ectodermal thickening in milk line + ectodermal thickening placode bud.== 
- ==placode signals adjacent mesenchyme makes thiceknings which support ductal growth -> nipple== 
failure to downregulate any of the factors = multiple nipples. 
polymastia along the milk line, and nipple plythelia too . 
- ==in women - polymastia - we can notice aberrant breast tissue which enlarges during pregnancy== 
- ==polythelia often seen in young men - discoloration similar to nipple color.== 
looks like benign nevus - we should see sebacious glands and the down growth. 

==ectoderm with WNT -> WNT will induce changes in the underlying mesenchyme, which will make rings around the breast bud.==
- ==ectoderm makes cord that will drive thru those rings and then eventually make the ductal tree==
- ==baisally ectoderm + concentric rings -> make the nippl externally== 
- whatevers made by the ectoderm / mesoderm - there's gonna be the receptor for it on the other one - **huge collab between ectoderm + mesoderm.**
transcription factors - huge with cancers. lots of remodding with the mesenchyme - if some markers exist still - we can get cancers of breast. 

==9 wks - concentric ring makes nipple basically - but this time we have a deression or a mammary pit== 
==first trimester - each cord makes a lactiferous duct which makes a whole lobe of the breast==
- ==you only have as many lobes as there are lactiferous ducts.== 
- each lactiferous duct will empty independently into the nipple - not collectively! 
- ==2nd trimester - lactiferous duct gives rise to lobular branches== 
==birth - all the lactiferus ducts empty onto there, all breast tissue fits under or beneath areola.== - regulated by molecular signals, but also gets influenced by maternal hormones!!
	after birth might secrete alpha lactalbumin, fat + wbcs in male and female neonates. 
==we don't know for sure... but **breast has about 9-10 main lactiferous ducts**; therefore only 9-10 lobes== 
- even tho some books say breast develops from 15-25 cords.. which is not true. 
- ==ppl say lactiferous duct makes a dilated sinus before it opens on nipple - **but there's no such thing as it!**==
puberty 
T-> involutes duct system 
E-> accelerted duct elongation + branching + **terminal end buds develop!**

each lactiferous duct post adolescence - makes intralobular ducts from the primary/lobular branch , then terminal ducts with alveolar buds at the very end 
- ==structure of a lobe - think that all that interlobar dense CT thickens around each lobe==
- ==there's fat between each lobe randomly - **size of a female breast is dictated by how much fat there is, not how many lobes**==
just an area supplied by one lobular branch - 3 terminal duct units. 
- ==intralobular ducts + tubulosecretory units surrounding it, we call that **TDLUs** - terminal ductulee lobular unit== 
==![[TDLU histoo breast.png]]==
myoepithelial cells - from ectodermal stem cells, adjacent to secretory end piece. 
- ==oxytocin -> causes contraction of myoepithelial cells -> causes the milk to go to nipple - expulsion of milk== 

in nonlactating female- there's some canges that match the cycle 

![[Screenshot 2025-05-18 at 3.57.15 AM.png]]
estrogen + prog -> amplification of tubuloacinar units, some vascular changes and vacuoles seen more , many women say theres' a fullness 
- with menses, we see that apoptosis in terminal ducts 
- ask breast cancer pts when their last period was, when their menopause was bc we see that early onset of menstruation + late menopause - cancer predisposition 
apoptosis at onset of menstruation - 
- triggered by prog/e falling suddenly 

nonlactating adult female - fuzzy things at end = TDLUs. most of the mass of breast are the stroma. 
after lactating, TDLUS expand, most of it 80% is the TDLUs iwth lactation. 
during menopause - you get breast regression, mostly replaced by fat
changes in stroma 
- pre pubertal - dense stroma, no TDLU
- post pubertal - fairly desnse stroma + TDLU
- lactating - losing 60% stroma, TDLU little stroma. 
- post menopausal - no TDLU, less stroma, more fat. 

==secretory cells - make protein called casein. and also lipid vacuoles secreted - as apical membrane buds offf -== 
- **the membrane itself is inside the milk - a timed release**
- merocrine secretion - proteins
- milk lipids - apocrine secretion - some of the membrane or cell comes along 
==secretion for it. - when you stop breastfeeding - casein goes down -> then you have some metalloproteinase will **rise again, instrumental in remodding collagen!!!**==

breast has quadrants - straight thru the nipple - and lobulars are placed radially to nipple 
retromammary space - between deep fascia of pectoralis major musc + breast 
- where you radical mascectomy
- ==suspensory ligaments in keeping nipple close to 4th intercostal. as we age, these become less efficient== 

nipple - epidermal covering extends downwards, there's melanin and the fibrous nature too 
lactiferous duct - associated with sebacious glands under the covering o the epidermis
if you have a tumor, it can attach to the suspensory ligaments and cause dimpling on the outside. 
- and some lactierous ducts can be retracted = causes an inverted / retracted nipple 

review lymphatetic drainage of breast. 
![[lymph drainage breast.png]]
==medial breast will drain to parasternal nodes==
==preferential route for the cancer - in axillary nodes==

peau d'orange sign - swelling of breast in edema - we see orange texure with amplified pores. 
- lymphatic obstruction + inflamamtion 
male gyno - males can develop it 
- extension of breast beyond the subareolar area 
- bilateral - think some systemic reason - hormone/drug
- unilateral- mass , look into breast cancer.
