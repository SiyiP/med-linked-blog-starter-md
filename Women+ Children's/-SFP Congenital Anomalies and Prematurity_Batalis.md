![[5. Congenital Anomalies and Prematurity_Batalis_NOTES (1).pdf]]

just be familiar w the trends, not quite memorizing the statistics of these. 
SIDs - most common infant mortality like <1 yr. within this time we have prematurity 
1-4 yrs congenital anomalies, accidents, homicide, malignancies
5-14 yrs - accidents, malignancies, congenital anomalies, homicide. 

infant mortality - we don't do a good job with infant mortality in the USA. 
- inc incidence of sids
- low socec status
- poor maternal health 
- higher preterm births
we have had a significant decline in infant mortality rates. 
we still have some issues, above the national avg for that, but not as good as others. 
MUSC's building hospitals around in some counties. SC infant mortality rate up after years of decline. up by 40% - black infant deaths in SC. 
congenital: 
- malformation (abnormal from the start) - causes are mainly unknown 40-60%, and 12-25% chromosomal / mendellian, 10-12% environmental from mom 
- deformation/disruption - something interrupted it , extrinsically 
- ==sequences - once we see one anomaly we can see others. sometimes they're related via one thing causing the others.== 
- ==syndrome - several groups of individuals have this same set of stuff. - like some sort of thing underlying connecting but no direct domino effects== 
- ^^know examples from above - 
malformations: overall - most common congenital anomaly is cleft lip/palates. 
cardiovascular malformations - ASD/VSDs 
==genitourinary malformations - polycystic kidney disease.... horseshoe kidneys (more incidental)==
==musculoskeletal malformations - syndactyly - fusion of fingers , and sirenomelia(fusion of legs, unfortunately more genitourinary issues too) - cleft lip/palate , cleft can go up into cranial cavity, predisposing them to encephalopathy etc but mostly not that horrible==
==GI malformations - atresia - absence of an opening / lack of lumen development. usually in small intestine we have intestinal atresia (proximal part bulge, distal is shrunken)==

==central nervous system - microcephaly can go either way, can happen as a malformation or a zika virus deformation.== 
most severe - ==anencephaly - no legitimate CNS tissue, just fibrovascular. in utero they're fine, but no survival after birth - severe malformation== 
==situs inversus - mirrored internal organs - not always life threatening , higher freq of cardiac abnormalities though== 
==aplasia - lack of development of a tissue. radial aplasia - part of trisomy 18 **syndrome**, we have no forearm joint== 
==hypoplasia - underdev of a tissue ; congenital diaphragmatic hernias are seen due to hypoplasia of diaphragm==  

---
deformations/disruption 
==major disruption - amniotic band syndrome - amniotic membrane can wrap around, causing bloodless amputations of typically the digits== 
rocker bottom feet - malformation, part of a syndrome, a lot of trisomies, extra digits too - basically like a completely curved bottom of feet. feet get compressed basically in potters sequence, a deformation. 
==comma shaped, overlapping digits - deformation with oligoamnios.== 

syndromes
==turner , 45x - constellation with more than one underlying etiology - cystic hydromas , webbed neck,== 
trisomy 21 - simian crease - seen more commonly ; also in ==down syndrome - more acute leukemia==

==potter sequence - low on amniotic fluid - anything that leads to this = can lead to potter's sequence, and see pulmonary hypoplasia (main cause of death)==
- ==oligo hydramnios -> ammion nodosum, pulm hypoplasia, fetal compression, breech pres, altered faces.== 
- rocker bottom feet. 
- recall - ==there's growth factors in that amniotic fluid  - if we're short on it, we don't stimulate the lung growth.== 

teratogens - alcohol - 
- later in pregnancy - critical phase is okay, but still some damage
- ==critical phase - remember that from 4-8 weeks is huge for all your organs.== 
fetal alc - ==delayed growth + dev , deformations; more heart defects ;== 
- low nasal bridge, no philtrum, know - kids of different ethnicities with it. 
- ==note - dads to be should stop drinking up to 6 months before the fact for cardio issues==
thalidomide - huge medical travesty phocomelia. severe limb defects. still seen in leprosy but black box warning 

--
==term - anything 37 weeks or later== 
- ==causes of prematurity - multiple gestation, chorioamnionitis, rupture of membranes== 
==posterm - after 42 weeks! - unknown cause, fetal + maternal complications.== 
"small for gestational age" - ==10th percentile or less - fetal growth restriction== - less than 25 g term ... otherwise weighting less than 10th percentile. 
- baby - chromosomal syndromes like turners ; maternal factors like mom with htn, smoking , etc 
=="big for gestational age" - top 10%,== term ; ==weighing more than 4000-4500 g== , ; causes diabetes and genetics. cmoplications - birth trauma. seen issues with mortality - proceed with c section

==prematurity - complications respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane dz - 10% of premature births==
- also ==male, maternal diabetes, c section recommended.== 
- ==maternal diabetes - insulin suppresses surfactant production; decreased surfactant -> collapsed alveoli + resultant hypoxia== 
- ==treat with corticosteroids + artificial surfactant==(doesnt work as well), ventilator support ; any stress baby feels - increased surfactants ! 
environment want to crush that alveoli, but surfactant breaks the air pressure etc. keeps it open. 
- causes ==hypoxemia + co2 retention -> acidosis ; endothelial + epithelial dmg with pulm vasoconstriction + hypoperfusion of pulmonary system.== 

==hyaline membrane disease - we see thick goopy pink material lay down a coating around alveoli , occurring in prematurity (lungs without surfactant AND aren't ready!) -thicker alveolar septa, o2 hard to work into the tissue.== 
- hyaline coats outside of alveoli + airways. we ==sometimes see a gray later phase as it's being cleared==
- ==clinically - see ground glass appearance of lungs.== 

we need enough ventilator support but not too much. ==too much ventilator support = **complication interstitial emphysema**. if we turn on the ventilator too much we'll blow out the lung tissues, forcing too much air into it = makes a pneumothorax! popped lung== 
- clinically a pneumothroax is seen - black tissue - too much air, popped and shrunken lung on xray
