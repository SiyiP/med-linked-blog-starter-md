note- this is less testable but we need to know this on a daily basis to prevent death! 
very common situation - kid's in unsafe sleep position and suddenly die
==SUID - sudden unexpected infant death , hot spot 2-4 months, less than 1 yr of age. most of the times, we call it undetermined.== 
- poisoning or OD
- cardiac chanelopathy - long QT syndrome 
- inborn errors of metabolism 
- infections 
- accidental suffocation - what we used to call SIDS
- ==unknown = SIDs = the same thing basically. = sudden + unexpected death under 1 yr of age; we didn't know what happened. just call it unknown ; stuff predispositions; SIDs in prev siblings, low SocEc group, sleep, brain stem abnormality etc.== 
babies in the crib should have nothing going on. huge campaign to stop it- safe sleep is so huge.

==workup of unexpected infant death - autopsy, xray, cultures, toxicology, metabolic screen - maybe cardiac channelopathy genetic testing; we note lividity pattern - where the blood settles/blanches on the kid, sleeping environment, etc. petechiae on autopsy is nothing specific== 
- note - lividity pattern ; where the blood settles - basically blanching = places where the kid is pressed 
- note rigor + sleeping environment ; adult bed is not safe. rigidity - how the body became fixed after death. 
- in fellowship - we go into the scene of the death to look at it - we see all sorts of things , too much in there. safe sleeping please. 
- autopsy-wise with SIDs we might see petechiae , nothing specific at all. 

asphyxial deaths - smothering = obstruction of nose + mouth , no specific findings 
==abuse - assailant often known like shaken baby syndrome , usually <4 yo child. we're mandated reporters ; know what happened with findings. head trauma accounts for most deaths 1k-1500 per year==

things to keep in mind - there's always an explanation - sometimes it's contrived, sometimes not - ask questions about things you see 
==what's suspicious for abuse? multiple impacts, odd locations, patterns like: contusions/bruises behind ear, palm of hand, multiple foci on head, posterior rib fractures, torn frenulum of face / gingival injury==
mimic = natural diseases or resuscitation 

things that would be greatest concern of inflicted abuse - several posterior rib fractures - almost always pathologic ; kids ribs are flexible, and anything else might just be from resuscitation or some medical thing. 

sus injuries - 
contusion/bruise behind ear 
contusion of ear , twisting and pinching ears. 
palm of hand too
inflicted head trauma of **multiple** foci ; basically multiple impact points under the scalp so many 
periorbital/ocular injuries too 
torn frenulum - from the gingiva to the lip - like with falling in some way = significant facial trauma 
gingival injury - mucosa tears seen with the teeth lining up there. 

==mimickers - sinusitis - looks like ocular injuries==
==drool rash - kinda diffuse looking, looks like multiple reddish bruises.== 
==traumatic alopecia - hair loss, many reasons for it - refer to derm; but some forms of pulling = **hairpulling can lead to subdural hemorrhages**==

==blunt head trauma = leading cause of death; when we pull back the scalp, we see hemorrhage + massive fracture== 
- head's a bit oblong, no skin contusions. when we pull back the scalp - we can see the hemorrhage + massive fracture. 

=="shaken baby syndrome" -> some controversy about if just shaking does it by itself? - just call it blunt head trauma== 
- often there's no external sign of trauma
- ==classic triad of subdural(see blood under shiny dura, due to bridging veins from skull to brain surface tear), subarachnoid(cannot wipe off), retinal hemorrhages(optic nerve has a lot of blood, similar to diabetic retinopathy); but some diseases can cause this - happens any time the head is swollen like infections==
	- subdural - under the shiny dura, we see blood. wipe it away bc it's due to **tearing of bridging veins from skull to brain surface.**
	- subarachnoid hemorrhage - underneath arachnoid layer, cannot wipe it off
	- retinal hemorrhage - bisected eye, optic nerve has a lot of blood - similar to retinopathy of diabetes etc. 
- ==brain moves back and forth = think axonal injury such as retraction balls that used to be axons in stains of brain; stains of beta amyloid protein or silver stain, shaking = bruising on arms==
	- axonal injury = see retraction balls (used to be axons) in the stains of the brain! 
	- beta amyloid protein stain
	- silver stain 
- ==chronic sequlae of head trauma/shaken baby syndrome- marked cerebral atrophy - child hospice - significant <3 dz, respiratory issues, **multi system organ injury** = there's no normal brain tissue, a lot of parts of the brain eaten up.== 

==2nd leading cause of death = abdominal trauma, see lacerations of the livers typically bc it's bigger in kids== 
- big bruises of belly = lacerations of the liver bc it's huge
- contusions of bowels can happen too - not really cause of death but a signifier

concerning skin injuries/mimics
- patterned injuries - more suspicious ! 
- ==mimic for skin stuff: eczema - reddish lesions all over== 
- ==common mimicker - sacral area hyperpigmentation = **blueish green midline with other lesions going up the spine = mongolion spot, congenital melancytosis**==
	- seen in ppl with darker skin usually. but happens in ppl of any ethnicity . 
	- can cut into it , just extra pigmentation. 

bone injuries / radiographs
- multiple fractures - very sus - might be osteogenesis imperfecta or massively traumatic issue 
- posterior rib fracure = abuse unless otherwise. 
==CPR injuries = mimics.== 
==External  Facial abrasions (mask, nails) Chin contusions  Adhesive tape marks Oropharynx mucosal tears  Lip contusions/lacerations  +/- skin and musculature trauma== 
==Internal Epicardial hematoma  Gastric perforation Hepatic/splenic/pancreatic injuries==

burns scald/spill or contact
irregular appearance in spill pattern - geographic, nonliner, varying severity 
==scald - used as punishment - hand into hot water, straight line coming across , feed as well (super straight line showing where it starts)==
how old is the kid? could they have the ability to turn on this etc. 

contact burns -like iron / cig ; 
- multiple is concerning 
==mimickers for contact burns - toxic epidermal necrolysis TEN, bulbous diseases = more irregular, diaper rash== 

munchausen by proxy - using the kid 

==lethal neglect - <1 yr, inconsistent hx, look at environment, birth hx / growth charts, interviews. radiographs for any demineralization and rickets==
- malnutrition/starvation/dehydration 
- history inconsistent
- thin appearing infant - is there something ? - home investigation 
- birth hx - are they premie? track weight over time , has it suddenly dropped off? 
- interviews w/ babysitters, family etc. 
do radiographs on these - full body, demineralization (malnutrition) - lost their skull cap etc. 
- looking at wrist for wrickets - x ray - looks okay? 
	- look at OTHER parts other than the wrist! might have had fractures down more of his arm. 
==large head, sunken eyes/cheeks/fontanelles, ribs , scaphoid abdomen + skin tenting. "dry and sticky" =  test electrolytes - increased sodium, cl => dehydration!!==
can die from secondary infections!!! 

==neglect mimickers - Intestinal malabsorption  Celiac disease  Protein-losing enteropathies  Pyloric stenosis  Cystic fibrosis  Other chromosomal/metabolic diseases==

also neglect can leave ppl into exposures , they can eat something etc. diaper rash spreading etc. obesity epidemic, gun access, med access
