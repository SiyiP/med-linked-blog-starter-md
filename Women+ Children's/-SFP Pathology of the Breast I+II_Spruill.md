#womenchild 
==nipple areola complexes have the lactiferous sinuses with extension into the ducts (the milk will be excreted from such)==
- ==lobular units radial from nipple to all 4 quadrants== 
- ==intralobular - fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, adipose tissue, vasculature==
- ==interlobular stroma (between the lobules) - **predominantly adipose tissue**==
- lymph drainage predominately to the ipsilateral same side axilla 
pecteralis major muscle is behind the tissue. 
recall. - from axilla to the groin = milk line distribution. 

==microanatomy - duct -> terminal duct lobular unit, lined by myoepithelial cells + have milk producing acini at the very end - some bubbly looking things and milk making things== 
acini = looks like rounded bunches of grapes. 
Pre-Pubertal: terminal duct unit with alveolar buds 
Post Pubertal, nulliparous: well developed lobules and acini 
==Pregnant: expanded, well developed lobules and acini  - bubbly look to it all.== 
Post menopausal: atrophy of the terminal duct units - we have regression back, more fatty replacement of breast 

young woman - mammogram is very dense + fibroblast stroma = pink 
==, mammogram during pregnancy - bubbly looking, more purple as more and more acini== 
==older mammogram = more shrinkage, more fatty replacement, **not as bright**==
predominantly gyno seen in puberty + elderly. seen with some drugs too - ==benign hyperplasia==
- ==morphology - looks normal benign, less lobular acini, has all the normal structures though.== 
- ==breast tissue density - always make a point about these bc impacts ability to see small lesions (very dense tissue, in younger pts and pregnant pts hard to see. or older pt on HRT)==

within epithelial component - worry about fibrocystic changes 
==hyperplasia, carcinoma in situs, carcinomas  = fibrocystic changes==
==stromal lesions - from intralobular regions typically== 
==sarcomas = typically interlobular== 
![[epithelial vs stromal findings.png]]presenting symptoms of breast dz 
- 90% of symptomatic breast lesions (palpable, frequently a fibroadenoma, usually benign) - 
- ==pain = usually benign== 
- women dz with cancer - caught with screening test. age at pres = likelihood of malignancy up. 
==mammogram and then do an xray + tomography - multiple stacked xrays==
- ==mass lesions, usually found in ultrasound - speculated v smooth bordered (good); changes over time too + size== 
- ==calcifications - can be pleomorphic, linear, changes over time==
US - usually for mass lesions , often used in conjunction 
- can find occult lesions + confirmatory 
- echogenic, orientation, vascularity 
==least common imaging modality is MRI , most useful after already been dx with cancer.== 
- occult enahancement - a lot of false negatives seen. 
focused breast exam - we don't really do it anymore to check breasts. now this happens in the dr's office but not as much. 
![[benign breast findings.png]]primarily fibrocystic change is the biggest ones that are most commonly found. 
- ==nonproliferative fibrocystic change = epithelial + benign but various risks like with cysts==
- ==proliferative fibrocystic change- increase in epithelium or myoepithelium== 
- ==atypical fibrocystic change- **on their way to being cancer. = atypical duct hyperplasia + lobular hyperplasia**==
==inflammatory processes - **masstitis - most common is infection in breastfeeding women, S. aureus most common**==
==diabetic mastopathy + sarcoidosis = autoimmune condition==
==foreign body rxns - like silicon granulomas getting some clear bubbles of silicone inside it surrounded by giant cells in ppl with implants. similar to fat necrosis - trauma to it = release of fats== 

==stroma lesions - 2 classes: the fibroademona + phyllodes tumor==
- growth of intralobular stroma + biphasic bc stromal + epithelial component
- ==shared driver mutations = they're different but come from same mutations==
==fibroadenoma - most common tumor, well circumscribed, young women but found in all ages.== 
- ==hyalinized stroma, ducts, no grapes. nodular appearance.== 
==phyllodes tumor - leaflike - can have more recurrence + more malignance = treat with excision.== 
- ==benign - well circumscribed few mitoses==
- ==border line = inc mitoses, more cellularity + recurrence==
- ==malignant - stromal overgrowth, atypical = risk is metastasis .== 

fibrocystic change - more common in breast biopses etc. important bc can be mass forming + variable association of getting breast cancer. 
- ==non proliferative fibrocystic change = no risk ; no epithelial hyperplasia, a **single layer, just some cysts, fibrosis, adenosis (problem with glandular tissue)** = BLUE domed cysts look blue! or palpable adenosis== 
- ==proliferative = 1.5-2x the relative risk for future cancer ; epithelial or myoepithelial hyperplasia==
	- ==most common - usual duct hyperplasia = where the duct space is filled with epithelium== 
	- ==sclerosing adenosis. - architectural disturbance in tubal structure but increase epithelium there==
	- ==papillary lesions/papilloma - increase of epithelium inside the lumen.== 
- ==atypical = 4-5 times the relative risk of future cancer. can be atypical duct or lobular hyperplasia== 
	- lesions diagnostically challenging, looking at duct carcinoma in situ or something but aren't quite that morphologically sufficient for the dx. 
	- ==increased epithelium inside the lumen, but also trying to make ducts within that growth in the lumen.== 
	- ==cribriform spaces, epithelium trying to make ducts inside the epithelium== 
	- Atypical duct hyperplasia ^^
	- atypical lobular hyperplasia = less volume than lobular carcinoma in situ 
- they both have a 4-5x relative risk of getting carcinoma ^^

carcinomas - age - risk increases. ; ==more of e-receptor positive cancers as we age== get more
==young women - more likely to get triple negative cancer.== 
- if you have a ==live birth less than 20 yrs of age, (young mother) you decrease your risk of getting breast cancer by half.== 
- if you ==breast feed = protective.== 
- having a ==first degree relative = germline mutation = much increased risk of cancer.== 
rare under age of 25 and most cases are women 50+ 
being in the west = increased risk of breast cancer. diet , repro pattern, etc. 
- more aggro forms in AA + latino. but most common in european women. 
==ionizing radiation - like hodgkin lymphoma as kid treatment raises risk== 
obesity, hrt, alc 

![[Malignant Breast dz outline.png]]
think about it clinically and how we characterize it? - these all help drive therapy choices. 
- ==malignant cancers are clinically divided by biomarker profile, like ER = estrogen receptor driven , or Her2 prooncogene , or cancers that produce NO receptors = triple negative, no estrogen r, no prog r, and no her2.== 
==in literature, they split into luminal A, b, basal-like, her2.== 
- ==luminal A = least aggro, usually ER poz ; Er positive, her2 negative, 50-65% of all tumors== 
	- ==PI3K + BRCA2 mutations lower grade.== 
- ==luminal b = a bit more aggro, usually ER poz, sometiemes prog neg,== 
	- ==TP53 altered, higher grade.== 
- ==basal-like = usually trip neg ; all negative. 10-20% of tumors== 
	- ==BRCA1, TP53 mutations, high grade== 
- ==her2 tumors; ER poz or neg. 10-20% of tumors== 
	- ==Erb2 or her2 altered, intermediate to high grade.== 
==morphology - noninvasive are ductal and lobular usually, usually confined and held by myoepithelial cells== 
- no movement out, confined to the ductules, held in place by myoepithelial cells - all precursors to invasive carcinomas. 
==DCIS = ductal carcinoma in situ - **associated with necrosis and calcifications! linear ducts**==
	treat like cancers. - ==cribriform, solid papillary , can be low-high grade (usually more atypicall, central necrosis), **great prognosis**==
==paget's dz of nipple - extension of DCIS up to the lactiferous sinuses to nipples== to the nipple - makes an ulceration in the areola. 

==LCIS - lobular carcinoma in situ - _uniform cells with bland round nuclei, incidentally found, **fully expanded the unit, unlike atypical lobular hyperplasia, which doesnt fill the whole thing_**==
- ==risk rises bilaterally, LCIS develop invasive cancers 2/3 on the same side. treat w/ anti-estrogens== 
- usually everywhere on breast so treat with anti estrogens
- more of high risk asian. 

invasive cancers - out of epithelium and into the space. 
- ductal v lobular - grades 1-3
many types of ductal. 
==nottingham combined histo grade = higher it is for invasive cancers (all ductal vs lobular) = more poorly difff it is = loss of normal tissue.== 

![[Breast Carcinomas Slider.png]]
note - ==**invasive lobular carcinoma - single celled single file infiltration thru the stroma**== 
- ==cells lost e-cadherin, so basically they squeeze themselves thru the fibrosis as single cells==
- ==unique metastases - **CSF, brain metastases, bone marrow, GI ovary**==
- ==ALWAYS ER poz, her2 neg.== 
==invasive ductal carcinoma==
- ==most common type o breast cancer==
- ==ranges more well-poorly diff. prognosis base on size, tage, biomarker sinus==
- ==yello fat, tan pink fleshy looking==
	==tubular carcinoma - little acini glands that are spread out, small irregular mass ; ER poz, her2 neg, good prognosis== 
	
==mucinious carcinomas - blueish - ER poz, her2 neg, better prognosis==
==medullary carcinoma - poorly diff trip neg breast cancer, intense lymphocytic infiltrate of t cells, better prog than other trip negative breast cancers. brca1 mutation carriers==
==metaplastic carcinomas - poorly diff, often trip negative - **these have squamous features!!! unlike all the others which are adenocarcinomas. we have cartilage, poor response to chemo ): **==

==inflammatory carcinomas - presentation of invasive carcinoma - we see lymphatic clogging = orange peel skin of the breast+floating tumors very poor prognosis!== dermal lymphatic invasion - we see a lot of floating tumors. 
very poor prognosis - less than 50% 5 yr survival bc this shit's already in the lymphatics. 
==angiosarcoma - most common sarcoma - interlobular things, outside epithelium; CD31 radiation staining seen== 
- ==secondary to radiation treatment, can be primary in younger women, but most commonly 10 years post radiation in older women.== 
- ==bruising purple rash ont the surface==
- ==little blue wisps = endothelial cells = more of the vascular lining stuff.==

pathogenesis of it will vary 
![[Biomarkers Breast Cancer PAths.png]]
==BRCA 1 + BRCA 2 = both suppressors - so we require loss of heterozygosity - mutation of both alleles==
commonly germline mutations - all cells from brith 
incidense rises of breast + ovarion serous carcinoma. 
- ==BRCA1 = triple negative== 
- ==BRCA2 = ER poz== 
main mutations we should know of ^^

interval cancers - if they present between screening intervals - typically fast growing and high grade. 
usually metastasizes into the axillary LN first. 

==tumor stage - pathologic stage - **CAP = phase on pathologic findings.**==
==clinical stage - tumor stage + whether there's any sort of metastases .== 
distant Metastases (Clinical Stage IV) = 11% 5y survival 
==Pattern of metastases dependent on biologic type:== 
==TNBC, Her2 positive: brain and viscera== 
==ER positive: bone==

treatments - 
==ER poz treat with - some blocking er, tamxifen, etc.== 
==her2 antibodies - trastuzumab, pertuzumab.== 
just having a general idea of good vs bad histo subtype, not dx purely based off of that. 
==palpable cysts - fibroadenomas = more of younger women, usually smooth borders, growth **parallel to skin**==
==cancers = of older women - **antiparallel or perpendicular to the skin, spiculated, posterior shadowing on US.**==

recall - lobula carcinoma in situ uniquely confers bilaterally inc risk of breast carcinoma. 
- also uniquelly lost an adhesion molecule, unique metastatic pattern too! 
angiosarcoma - CD31 , post-radiation tumor that comes back. 
==note that the ER-poz breast cancers can recur later on.==
