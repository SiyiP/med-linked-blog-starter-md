#womenchild 
ex 1st one 
G2P1A0 , 2 pregnancies, delivered one, not lost any. prenatal labor, suspected congenital anomalies on neonatal US 
36 and 1/7 wks, uncomplicated c section 
- blue baby, flaccid, unresponsive to stimuli, no Resp effort, HR <60
- normal range for neonatal HR = 100-160 bpm 
APGAR score remember? ![[APGAR Score Algo.png]]
we score @ 1 min to see how they tolerated delivery 
then 5 min to see how they're going outside the wound. 
7+ = normal. 
baby in the example =  1 APGAR score intially. 
in case: 2 min has a 2, and then at 5 min has 3. 
o2 poz pressure w/out any improvement ... o2 sat remain low in 60s in spite of retubation. 

low o2 sats
- where's the ET tube? we don't know where it went - lung and cardiac pathology might divert it. endotracheal tube - between thoracic inlet(head of clavicles + carina)
- gold std - get an echo. make sure you know where every intervention we made is in place. 
- IV access thru the umbilicus, orogastric tube inserted into esophagus. 
- orogastric tube - should be in the GI system, near midline. umbilical venous catheter. ideally in at the junction of IVC + RA. 
	- when there's an issue of passing this, worry abt esophageal obstruction - **diagnostic of esophageal atresia, with other pathologies**
	- most common - esophageal atresia with distal tubulo esophageal fistula (**basically gap between esophagus and trachea, food + fluid intering lungs**), isolated esophageal atresia is second most common. 
		- we'll see gas in the GI tract if there's EA with TEF
		- prenatally tho we'll see complete EA in screening atresia - we look for fluid in the stomach; and we see NONE. 
	- bowel gas pattern - like an hour or so more - we see less air in EA 
	- but we might see with it: **duodenal atresia!!! double bubble**; air in stomach, dilated duodenum but no air distal to that. 
		- trisomy 21 association with this. 
		- most common presentation of duodenal atresia - **bilious vomiting.** 

echo from the baby - what's the abnormality ?  we notice a loosened dark area along the right heart border, all around the border, lucency, air in the wrong place, air outside the lung is seen! too dark = **pneumothorax.**
- small lungs with inadequate gas exchange , aka bilateral pneumothorax = suggest **pulmonary hypoplasia** with SMALL THORACIC cage
	- **named by potter's syndrome**
- decreased amniotic fluid -> inadequate dev of lungs, crowding = limb deformities, characteristic faces. 
- this baby has flexion contractures and foot deformities
- hypertelorism (wide set eyes), low set ears, flat nose, receding chin. 
- unerlying cause of decreased amniotic fluid in potter's sequence - 
	- **kidneys are the primary producers of amniotic fluid in the final 2 trimester.**
	- basically lack of fetal urine. look for renal abnormalities - Ultrasound. **kidney could be anywhere - in this one we dont find one on the RUQ**
		- no kidney found in where it should be. see no bladder (no shadowing)
		- no kidneys at all. **renal agenesis - not compatible with life ):**
coeur en sabot - **boot shaped heart**, seen in textbooks. squared off and very hypoplastic

tetralogy of fallot - VSD, **pulm stenosis,** RV hypertrophy, overriding aorta.  
- pulm stenosis is a huge indicator of survival. and the cause of all these things. VSD - bc there has to be _something_ that gets blood to the body 
- coeur en sabot boot shaped heart , apex gets turned up. bc the pulm a is very small, so we see an aortic arch. 
- overriding aorta sitting up on the wall of the VSD. unoxygenated blood sent out into the system. 

physical exam
imperforate anus - big dilated colon on plain film, also seen on ultrasound 
multiple vertebral anomalies = segmentation anomalies, some that are abnormally fuzed together. - butterfly vertebra, no real sacrum, narrow pelvis+sacral agenesis 

classic - **Vacterl association/syndrome**- not really understood bc all these organ systems don't develp at same time.. 
Vertebral anomalies
Anorectal malformations
Cardiac anomalies
TracheoEsophageal fistula 
Renal anomalies
Limb abnormalities 
theories - repetitive teratogen exposure, malformation sequence? disturbance based on single gene?
