infant mortality - <1 yr - SIDs
1-4 yrs - accidents most common, malignancies are less common but there 
==5-14 yrs - malignancies is the 2nd leading cause of death== 

benign tumors and non-tumors. 
things that may or may not be actual tumors. 
- ==heterotopia - benign - normal tissue, where it doesn't belong ! classical example are meckel's diverticulum, outpouching of bowel, pancreatic tissue is growign inside it== 
- ==hamartoma - benign right tissue, right place, but too much ! there's a fine line between this and benign neoplasm. uniquely, rhabdomyomas are benign tumors or neoplasms but they will regress over time unlike these.== 
real benign tumors
- ==hemangiomas - tumors benign! overgrowth of blood vessels, spontaneously regress, **autosomal dom, disfiguring face, skin etc.**==
	- will spontaneously regress, most common infancy tumor; **autosomal dominant**
	- disfiguring, skin, face scalp
	- ==associated w syndromes if larger in the face- von hippel lindau (pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, brain tumors.)== 
	- ==sturge-weber - seizures, cognitive issues **port wine stain = abnormal hemangioma**==
	- can be a mimic of abuse - spontaneously regressing can look like a circular lesison , might look like cig burn [[-SFP Forensic Pediatrics]]
	- microscopically - **benign blood vessels!**
- ==lymphangiomas - similar to hemangiomas in skin , deeper, but may stimulate invasive tumor, lymph channel overgrowth, not invading==
	- lymphatic channel overgrowth 
	- can be deeper into the thing, but not invading. 
	- microscopically - lymphatic channels everywhere instead of capillaries 
	- ==lymphangioma + cystic hygroma + hydrops = we most likely see congestive heart failure==
- ==sacrococcygeal teratoma = germ cell tumors of 3 tissues!== 
	- germ cell tumors, might have all 3 or any 3 tissues endoderm, meso, ectoderm
	- ==75% benign, depends on maturity ; if it's mature = more good, but if it's immature, lots of blue, not differentiated - not good.== 
	- more classical forms - seen in birth trauma. but mainly just seen in ultrasound nowadays 

==erythroblastosis fetalis + extramedullary hematopoesis - seen in any fetal  anemia== 
	- extramedullary hematopoesis - seen in spleen , body's doing anything we can to make those RBCs; sinusoids empty, megakarycytes**, **red/white precursors in areas outside bone marrow**** 
	[[-SFP Prematurity, Hydrops and Cystic Fibrosis_Batalis]]
==kernicterus, bilirubin in brain - has to be hemolytic anemia==

malignant tumors
- not much in 1st year of life, starts ramping up later from 5-14 yrs 
- ==mainly getting **hematopoietic tumors wayyy more than adults**, also CNS(getting it in lower half of brain) and soft tissue tumors== 
- they have a ==more embryonal primitive appearance, **small, round blue cell tumors.** - so primitive we can't tell what cell it is!== 
- ==pure and genetically driven. ; they are very aggro, so they have many mutations that can be targeted - better survival rates! can show sporadic maturation and regression.== 
- will show sporatic maturation/regression 

top 3 focus =="blast" = **immature, undifferentiated cells**==
- ==neuroblastoma - in adrenal glands AND up and down sympathetic chain!- note that the liver takes up a lot of room in the abdomen for kids - large yellow mass seen off to the side of it== 
	- ==MYCN gene - **protooncogene** encodes a transcription factor;== most important implication = **if amplified, bad prognosis!**
		- ==amplifications - extra chromosomal material called **"double minutes**" = many extra chromosomes with sooo many dots and debris in the bgd, extra survival material.== 
		- ==FISH: sees some instead of a red/green signal we might see a yellow = double minutes, extra copies.== 
	- only half are in the adrenal gland, other half is can be up and down the sympathetic chain too! 
	- spontaneous mature or, regression 
	- ==pathologic grade = MKI(what % of cells are mitoses), differentiation(more differentiated is better), stroma(pink material in between, more = better) - how does it behave?== 
	- ==clinical stage = location, completeness of excision - ultimately the one we look at the most== 
	- ==age of patient - better prognosis when they're like in a few months of age== 
	- histologic/lab - ==**homer wright pseudorosettes** - a rosette (true one has nothing in the middle); there's some light pink material in the middle! almost looks like glands== but they're not! small round blue cells w/ pseudorosettes.
	- ![[homer wright pseudorosettes.png]]
		- lab dx - look for catecholamines, rarely functional 
		- ==catecholamines - metabolites in the URINE - if VMA or HMA increased we have a neuroblastoma== 
	- ==**blueberry muffin baby** - basically we have some skin metastases. we see a bunch of dots subcutaneously where it's set up. + large abdominal mass.== 
	- grossly - gonna be on the kidney, ==**more heterogeneous**==, kidney's not involved, just compressed down or on the sympathetic chain. 
	- we don't have to know the ganglioneuroblastoma to a ganglioneuroma, but know the maturation - getting more and more stroma in between and then note there's more ganglion-like features with older ones. 

- ==wilms tumor / nephroblastoma - kidneys==
	- some associated with syndromes - ==all chromosome 11== , diff mechanism 
		- ==WAGR - wilms, **aniridia(lack of iris, pupil looks HUGE)**, genital, cognitive issues(r-tardation) - about 30% get wilms, **deletion 11p13**== 
		- ==Denys-Drash - genital and renal anomalies - 90% get wilms tumors, **dominant negative mutation** 11p13== 
		- ==Beckwith-Wiedemann: huge organs, hemihypertrophy; 11p15.5 gene , relationship with IGF2 , there's some imprinting that goes on with insulin like growth factor = huge organs and growth!== 
	- 2-5 yrs of age, seeing ==abdominal mass + hematuria== 
	- histologically -
		- ==**triphasic** histology *immature cells, normal kidney tubules, and stroma = 3 layers*== 
		- anaplasia too - convergence of clinical stage + pathological grade
		- ==nephrogenic rests -stroma + tubules , some overgrowth seen on kidney that could be a precursor , esp with contralateral risk. gelatinous, small immature tubules and spindled pink stroma but maybe no blastomas.== 
		- microscopically - we see ==many circular tubules, tumors that try to make the normal stuff like spindled stroma, and blastema - small round blue = triphasic== 
	- this one really kills off the ==kidney, bulky, lobulated, white form and appearance pushing the borders==!!! 


- ==retinoblastoma - eye / in posterior retina - RB1 gene = **classic tumor suppressor gene**==
	- 2 years = median age
	- familial or sporadic form 
		- anything f==amilial - bilateral, more aggro ; and more likely to have RB1 loss.== 
		- association with ==**osteosarcoma**== in family
		- knudson's two hit hypothesis - imagine we have one mutation from the parent as a somatic mutation, we just need one more to cause that tumor to develop. 
	- nodular mass in posterior retina - unique for location 
	- ==**flexner wintersteiner rosettes** - a true lumen in the middle!==
	- ==diagnosis from white eye reflex - they have cloudy vision - seen when you shine it across, **we just have this wall of white where we shoulda been seeing a reflection**==
	- microscopically - inside the eye we see some dark material (should just be viscous fluid)
