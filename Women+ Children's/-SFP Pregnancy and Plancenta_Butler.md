utility of placental exam
- immediately treatable processes identified= fungal stuff
- determine underlying cause of what went wrong w pregnancy 
- lesions that have recurrence risk 
- guidance for what we can do in the future esp with cancers 
spontaneous abortion 
- 1-13 wk first trimester mostly 
- 14-26 weeks 2nd one 
- 27-40 weeks 
==spontaneous abortion = preg loss before 20 weeks, accounts for about 10-25% pregnancy loss== 
==-Threatened – uterine bleeding without cervical dilatation== 
==• Inevitable – uterine bleeding with cervical dilatation or effacement== 
• Incomplete – all tissue has not yet passed 
• Complete – all tissue (products of conception) passed 
• Missed – intrauterine retention after embryonic or fetal death
60-80% due to fetal structural/karyotype abnormalities
==some maternal causes of spontaneous abortion- structural abnormalities of uterus, uncontrolled diabetes/htn, infection== 
==reasons for examining spontaneous abortions - rule out ectopics, id suspected abnormalities  rule out gestational trophoblastic dz like big villi with hydropic change = risk for carcinoma== 
==RF for ectopic - **scarring , prior PID and other causes like age 40+ and smoking**==
- Pelvic pain, amenorrhea, +/- vaginal bleeding • Determine last menstrual period
- any rupture = med emergency - 6% maternal deaths ; thin smooth muscle, where as we have the fetus invade more and more we can easily rupture. 

==Placenta previa – location of placenta over internal cervical os (normal implantation site is upper wall of uterus!), low lying, common with older, multipariety, male infants==
- this is gonna be low lying - these are more common in older, associated w multipariety, male infants, and previous 
- ==vasa previa - location of fetal vessels are over the cervical os, where they cross over to the umbilical of baby, a good probability of rupture. do NOT do a vaginal exam, might need C section== 
	- ==velamentous cord insertion - where we overly the cervix, **unprotected by umbilical cord the vessels** at risk of rupture... the umbilical cord is inserted in the fetal membranes==
	- ==bilobed placental discs - 2 equally sized placental lobes, with the chorionic vessels not protected and inserted into the fetal membranes and able to rupture.== 
- previa - inc risk for abruption, malpres, postpartum hemorrhage. 
	- **CI: Vaginal exam!!! principal causes of 3rd ptrimestr bleeding, might require a c section depending**
==placenta accreta spectrum - placenta impacts past decidua into **myometrium**, and then placenta gets abnormally adherent and cannot deliver normally in areas of accreta... problem postpartum lifethreatening bleeding bc placenta inside smooth muscle, hysterectomy== 
- ==further into myometrium - increta, no decidua, just the chorionic villi inserting into the smooth muscle / myometrium== 
- ==percreta - past the myometrium==
- problem - the placenta is retained in the smooth muscle -> **lifethreatening postpartum bleeding** - dx before a US or MRI , typically plan for hystrectomy 

inflammatory lesions of placenta 
acute -> amniotic fluid infections
- ascending bacterial infection from vagina to the amniotic fluid inhaled by baby 
- group B beta hemolytic strep , E. Coli, H. flu, enterococcus, 
- ==ACUTE amniotic fluid infections from ascending vaginal bacterial... GBS colonization = fetal infection. prophylaxis with antibiotics can reduce this== 
==chronic -> TORCH infections or unknown etiology, going transplacentally are toxo, syphilis, cmv,, parvo and HSV.== 
- typically chronic due to TORCH orgs , goes **transplacentally from ma to baby**
- typically cause chronic placental infections. - 
	- **Toxo, syphilis, CMV, parvo, HSV**
	- transplacental = hematogenous 
	- CMV = common infection - mostly have it, no routine screening 
	- mom can either be asymptomatic or with mononuc like illness-
	- causes seizures + blueberry muffin (not super specific of a trait IG) petechial rash in brain+ hearing loss 
	[[-HRR Congenital Infections_Kasman]] [[-HRR Viral Exanthams_Kasman]]
==plasma cells = CMV = viral thing , hemosiderin depots seen bc we are attacking these endothelial cells - brown pigment + classic owl eye nuclear inclusions== 

==syphilis - hematogenous spread = yellow infiltrate from mom to fetus. we see spirochetes== 

==maternal inflammatory response -> neutrophils marginate to the amnion to fight infection, basically, going to that surface.== 
==fetal response - we have neutrophils going from umbilical + chorionic vessels to amnion to fight infection - so much cells that are spreading.== 

amniotic fluid infections - subclinical - more commonly than clinical 
chronicity + severity of infection = predict poor outcomes, we can get early fetal death, disability, etc. 

recurrent lesions - 
- ==chronic villitis of unknown etiology - VUE most common - thought to be like transplant rejection of paternal + fetal antigens = so the mom antibodies will reject the placenta + destroy the chorionic villi.== 
- depending on severity, might result in growth restriction + death 
==malperfusion - from either mom or fetus perfusing the placenta - fetal/maternal vascular malperfusion; can be flow obstruction on fetal side or spiral artery remodding with preclampsia on the moms... caused by ANY TRIAD OF THROMBOSIS==
- fetal = flow obstruction 
- Maternal = problem with remodding spiral arteries. = seen in preclampsia 
anything that will prmote the triad of thrombosis : causes this 
- ![[thrombosis triad placental injury.png]]

==hypercoiled umbilical cord = deep invaginations between each one will make the flow veryyyy much more static = more thrombosis== 

maternal vascular malperfusion - ==a problem with mom to placenta due to some error with spiral artery remodding - so we have the low capacitance high pressure system - where blood quickly shoots out and hits only one area.== 
- ==from abnormal/shallow placentation, where host fails to provide differentiation signals for extravillous trophoblasts -> they don't remod them==
- mom doesn't perfuse placenta -> oxidative stress of hypoxia 
- ==placental injury oxidative stress -> anti angiogenic mediators released, causing systemic preelampsia + proteinuria== 
seen with autoimune dz, and Diabetes but fetal growth restriction w preeclampsia is most predictive 

==placental hypoplasia <10% of gestational weight, severe growth restriction ->== 
==decidual arteriopathy - pathology in decidual arteries (like htn causing depo of fibros and stuff), *foamy macrophages* fill the cell==
==accelerated villous maturation - when we are hypoxic, we increase more and more terminal villi to exchange.== 
==villous infarction - we get some areas of coagulative necrosis then thrombus in hematomas== 

==preclampsia - triad: hypertension, proteinuria, edema, 140/90+ after 20 wks, proteinuria 300+, and common in first pregnancy primiparas, twin, obesity, 35+ , dm, htn, kidney dz==
- htn 140/90 + after 20 weeks
- proteinuria 300+ 
- most common in first preg primiparas, twin , obesity, 35+ , diabete,s htn, and kidney dz 
eclampsia - **preeclampsia WITH seizurs!**
==HELLP syndrome = we need to deliver placenta and induce labor==
- ==hemolysis== 
- ==Elevated liver test==
- ==low platelets== 
treat - delivery of placenta, we induce labor . 
==placental abruption - **premature separation** of placenta from uterine call==
- ==concealed = confined to uterine cavity vs revealed where blood goes to cervix.== 
- - acute v chronic too, 
- acute = involves 45% of placenta + can cause fetal death 

dizygotic twins - fraternal - 2 sep eggs, 2 sep sperms, 
- diamnionic dichorionic 
	- fused - has a dividing membrane between 2 sacs
	- separate - separate sacs 
	- seen by ultrasonography 
	- can't tell if they're id or not by examination of placenta in dichorionic placentation 
==monozygotic twins - identical - we can have them dichorionic or diamniotic too== 
==morula cleavage. - dichorionic diamniotic - 2 amions, 2 chorions== 
==blastocyst cleavage =  monochorionic diamnionic - 2 ammions same placenta though== 
==IMPLANTED Blastocyst cleavage - monochorionic monoamnionic = **cord entanglement can happen w/ monochorionic pregnancies, can get twin twin transfusion between them**==
==cleavage in formed embryonic disk - conjoined twins -==
monochorionic pregnancies - we can get twisting of pores and vasculature = vasculature anastomoses = twin twin transfusion between them. - abnormal sharing of circulations thru AV shunt 
- imbalance causes marked disparity in fetal blood volumes = results in death 

gestational trophoblastic dz - spectrum of tumors/tumor like conditions characterized by placental tissue prolif 
- ==hydatidiform moles - cystic swelling of villi , variable trophoblastic prolif==
	- ==complete mole = without fetal embryonic tissue; but risk of persistent trophoblastic dz... + future choriocarcinoma... **increase in b-hcg**== 
		- big grape like hydropic pattern + villi with trophoblast hyperplasia, 
		- **inc in b-hcg** 
		- ==!!!complete mole is diploid with paternal DNA== 
	- ==partial = with some fetal/embryonic tissue; **no significant risk of future trophoblastic dz/choriocarcinoma**==
			==these are TRIPLoid with 2 sets of dad's chromosomes + 1 set of moms'.== 
		- we have some fetal cells + intermixing with minimal hyperplasia
		
==choriocarcinoma - malignant - usually follows complete mole, pregnancies/miscarriages - gestational tumor , high cure rate to chemo!== 
can have some non gestational variants that do less well -
