==bronchopulmonary dysplasia / alveolar hypoplasia - no mature alveoli, etiology unknown== 
- decrease in # of mature alveoli, exact etiology unknwon 
- ==less than 1500 g, or 28 wks. 25% of births, basically premature disease. outcomes vary==
- outcome will vary 
- ==thicker septae, smaller alveoli or none==

==retinopathy of prematurity - **most common!** - much critical medical thing - have swings of oxygen changes==
- ==VEGF - responds when O2 low, needs more blood vessels so increase.== 
- ==then o2 up again at birth, and VEGF down, we will get less blood vessels again.== 
- ==proliferation keeps starting + stopping = poorly formed vessels -> eventually lead to bulbous aneurysms. kids in NICU will get optomology consults.== 
- 50% of births <1500 g 

==germinal matrix hemorrhage - feared; bleeding in the brain! 20% of these infants; Graded I-IV based on involvement, affects prognosis== 
==Grade I -restricted to subependymal region== 
	== Good prognosis==
== Grade II -extension into normal sized ventricles and typically filling less than half of the ventricle - but not distend ventricles ; fill but not distend ventricles.== 
	== Good prognosis==
== Grade III -extension into dilated ventricles== 
	== 20% mortality== 
== Grade IV –extension into parenchyma==
	== ~90% mortality==
==more caused by swings in blood pressure! prone to rupture.== 

==necrotizing enterocolitis = prematurity, low birth weight (mucosa weaker), tube feeds.== 
- ==seen with any infection , inflammatory mediators lead to necrosis of bowel wall. - predisposition with **tube feeds that damage mucosa**== 
- eventually ==leads from patchy to full thickness necrosis== 
- symptoms of ==bloody stools + bloating.== 
- ==stop any feeds! put on antibiotics + support with IVF==. if they get tooo severe, cut the bowel out (easier said than done bc it's all over the bowels)
- ==complication - pneumatosis intestinalis - histologically we see a big white air bubble in the mucosa - air is dissecting. this is a sign of perforation== 
==meconium aspiration = a fetal stress indication = - foul smelling, discolored amniotic fluid, resp distress most commonly in them... but can happen in anything== 

green placental discoloration from meconium - basically meconium is just sterrile, not infectious
- ==more of an obstructive phenomenon - in lungs, obstruction of airways==
- we can do a suction or try lavage. 
- most of th times, ==we do some ventilation and supportive therapies==. 
pathophys - starts with airway obstruction, lining alveoli, disruption

cystic fibrosis. - most common lethal genetic dz towards white populations- recessive, super **variable phenotype, 2000+ mutations out there.**
- ==70% of cystic fibrosis have delta F508, most severe, a frameshift deletion -== 
	- basically frameshift deletion seen 
	- CFTR - responsible for cl- transport, no work, sticky mucus dehydrated. 
	- skin doesnt have any manifestations - bc ==in the skin, the cl- is driven back INTO the cells instead of out. in other organ systems we're supposed to be sending cl- out. histo looks normal== 
- genitalia, intestine, lungs, etc all affected. 
- ==diseases seen - **pseudomonas aeruginosa + burkholderia cepacia...**==
==pancreas tan and lobulated fibrotic - malabsorption with vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea. -> rectal prolapse + edema== 
salty skin - liver dz cirrhosis, fatty plugged ducts, plugged lungs ;
==bronchiectasis- fixed dilated bronchioles. bad infections will erode thru those SMs.== 
infertility - prostate secretions cannot be cleared out 
==salivary glands are eaten away== 
==small intestines - meconium ileus, stuck inside the bowel==
sweat chloride test to get it an ==newborn screened with immunoreactive trypsinogen.== 
tan lobulated pancreas -> sheet of white - massive fibrosis seen in pancreas. 
eventually we get fibrofatty replacement 

==hydrops - most common cause of fetal hydrops - massive edema of the baby caused by Rh incompatibility - nowadays we have non immune anemia bc we have good medicines== 
- back in time that's Rh incompatibility ... nowadays we have non immune anemia 
immune - not too much in depth - formerly leading cause - Rh/ABO incompatibility with different blood types. attacks baby's blood cells. heart tries harder, heart worn out - edema
- med for it - rogan, which will coat the rbcs of baby, makes mom not able to recognize difference. 
- abo incompatibility - more mild bc can't cross placenta. 
non-immune 
- ==non-immune hydrops - cardiovascular, anything causing primary HF. congenital heart diseas. like huge endocardial cushion defect==
- ==non immune - primary anemias like parvovirus(RBC aplasia, washed purple cells with light rim around it) or others.== 
	- complications are ==erythroblastosis fetalis- immature RBCs - see many immature red cells without the clearing, cytoplasm cleared, nucleus still in there.== 
	- ==extramedullary hematopoesis - seen in spleen + stuff , body's doing anything we can to make those RBCs; sinusoids empty, megakaryocytes**, **red/white precursors in areas outside bone marrow****== 
	==if due to HEMOLYSIS - tearing apart these cells - we see bilirubin deposits into brain - kernicterus - long term dev delays.== 
- chromosomal anomalies - turner, trisomies
- infection - CMV, syphilis, toxoplasmosis 
if not controlled -> HF and death 
==anasarca - swelling and generalized edema==
