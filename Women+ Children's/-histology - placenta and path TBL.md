lobular duct will drain into lactiferous duct - one for each lobe. 
each lactiferous duct **is a lobar duct!** - serves like 9-10 lobes onto the nipple, draining independently! 
- lobar duct -> lobular duct -> intralobular -> terminal ducts + alveolar caps. 

highest percentage of cells for mature breast milk? - **macrophages** 
- "mature breast milk" - after true lactation has finished, after 1 wk. 
- cholostrom in that initial secretion (neutrophils earlier)
- by 10 days - after establishment macrophages are the most abundant. - what distinguishes human milk from formula - bioactive products are there *actively producing cytokines when ingested by baby*

myoepithelium? - ejection of milk? 
- precursor - **specialized epithelial type cell**
	- what causes this: cervical stretching+suckling -> oxytocin -> calcium -> actin
	- ***recall - oxytocin binds to the receptor G protein coupled receptors - you have to know these pathways.*** 
- transcriptional activation of target genes for milk prodteins are regulated by tyrosine kinas activity - what helps out with the prolactin from the anterior pituitary's mammotropes -> milk making 
	- this is NOT GPCR!!!! this is **JAK STAT pathway!!!**
		- prl binds at surface, Jak2 aggregate, phosphorylation and then STAT joins the tyrosine kinase -> sTAT dimer, which leaves complex and goes into nuc envelop 
		- STAT dimer binds to enhancer region for genes coding for breastmilk components
bilateral risk = lobular carcinoma in situ - only one of them when they have bilateral risk! 
don't base lcis v dcis on visual
lobular carcinoma in situ- discohesive, monotonous apperance, round to oval nuc, uniform chromatin. 
- ductal in situ - inc risk of ipsilateral
fibroprolif dz with atypia, 4-5 x relative risk 

for your lobular processes, you'll have loss of the e-cadherin, individual discohesive cells. 
on the other hand, we have invasive lobular carcinoma - 
- recall - mutation of CDH1 gene causes the loss of expression in LCIS unlike the other single file thing that causes the single file. 
lobular cancers - ER poz, CAD-
- Gain of function with Her2 <- ERb2 gene overexpressed. 
- tp53 - common mutation with all breast cancers. 

distinguish pagets from angiosarcoma
- angiosarcoma - unremarkable epidermis, subtle vasc prolif + rbc extravasation within dermis
	- purpleish reddish. 
	- some malignant new vessels are in angiosarcoma. 

intraductal papilloma - clear/bloody nip discharge, palpated as small lump, epithelial process, painful sometime, benign. 
mastitis - common with breastfeeding - inflammation of breast usually acute bacterial, neutrophils, erythematous, edematous, painful 

GAGs in the Connective tissues. these things that surround maternal bvs - are all around chorionic villi too, so the rigin of all the components are from **chorionic plate.**

on the fetal side - we see larger bigger vessels - which is **within the stem villi, these are all coming from the chorionic plate!**

gas/nutrient exchange from the intervillusspace into the fetal capillaries inside the villi? 
mature villi - no cytotrophooplasts, just syncytiotrophoblasts.
