## Highlights for -MMT Folate Metabolism_Hartman
- B9 - a soluble vitamin, folic acid is what you find in multi vitamins. we cannot make the linkage between the ring and the rest of it so it's essential[^11]
- Active form of folate - tetrahydrofolate, has 4 extra hydrogens on the pteridine ring + can carry 1 carbon units that vary in oxidation state[^11]
- Food sources - has a folate with linkages to glutamates... - polyglutamination[^11]
	- Has to be converted to the mono glutaminated form to be absorbed by enterocytes and then will be distributed[^11]
	- Then at the target tissues, they undergo poly glutamination again to trap the tetrahydrofolate THF into the cell[^11]
- Pregnant women need most liver + yeast extract to correct birth defects + anemia from less folate intake[^11]
- Dihydrofolate reductase converts folic acid to tetrahydrofolate THF w/ 2 NADPH + H[^11]
	- Just know - you add 4 total H atoms and NADPH coming from the pentose phosphate pathway[^11]
- The rate limiting enzyme of pentose phosphate pathway is glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase[^11]
The sequence: 
- Two step conversion of folic acid to THF via NADPH and dihydrofolate reductase[^11]
- THF will pick up a methylene group , converting serine to glycine via the enzyme serine hydroxyltransferase, making 5,10-methylene THF.[^11]
	- 5,10-methylene THF can be used by thymidylate synthase to turn dUMP to TMP, to reform the dihydrofolate completely.[^11]
- 5,10-methylene THF can also be used to be further oxidized into 5,10-methenyl THF.[^11]
- 5,10-methenyl THF can be hydrated into 10-formyl THF, used in purine biosynthesis to reform THF[^11]
	- 1. 2 steps in purine biosynthesis, just know the 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate is needed[^11]
- 5,10-methylene THF can also be used to make 5-methyl THF by methylene THF reductase[^11]
- 5-methyl THF is used for synthesis of methionine from homocysteine, with methionine synthase.[^11]
	- Methionine will be ATP'd into SAM... a methyl donor, which then donates, making
	- S-adenosyl *homocysteine*, then gets h2o'd, making adenosine leave and making homocysteine.[^11]
	- To go from homocysteine and make methionine again, we need to give a methyl group from *5-methyl THF , which passes it first to B12, which will then transfer to make methionine!!* basically both B12 and folate is necessary here[^11]
- After we donate that methyl group , the 5-methyl THF turns into reforming the THF.[^11]
- THF + some amino group from histidine degradation then will make 5-formimino THF[^11]
	- All we need to know - we get FIGLU from initial histidine degeneration[^11]
	- FIGLU acted on by Formiminotransferase , making glutamate at the end , and 5-formimino THF[^11]
	- *FIGLU used to test for folate deficiency*!!! it accumulates as a result of not having enough folate, after testing histidine load[^11]
	- For B12 deficiency test for MMA[^11]
- Deamination of 5-formimino THF -> 5,10-methenyl THF[^11]

- B12 = presents with neuro symptoms in addition to all else compared to folate deficiency ![^11]
- Megaloblastic anemia does not distinguish it.[^11]![[folate metabolism full.png]]
- Amino acids contribute **1 carbon units** into the folate pool being carried.[^11]
	- Serine + glycine = > gives methylene grp[^11]
	- Histidine - > formimino group[^11]
	- Tryptophan -> indirectly gives formyl group (other formates from methanol can be seen)[^11]
- Folate gives protection against homocysteinuria - seen with no folate, predisposes to stroke[^11]
- Folate = essential for nucleotide biosynthesis, paradoxical with cancer = if you starve cancer of folate, they will prevent formation of cancer.[^11]
	- Fluorouracil looks like dUMP, so it can compete with it in thymidylate synthase, binding irreversibly ; cannot make the dTMP, will destroy it and it's suicide inhibition.[^11]
	- Aminopterin + methotrexate - looks like dihydrofolate, binding in dihydrofolate reductase, so we cannot make THF.[^11]
	- We can prevent folate deficiency with taking 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate... since cancer cells don't take that up as well.[^11]
![[megaloblastic anemia histo.png]]This is what megaloblastic anemia is , note the multilobulated cells 
folate requirements 
- 400 micrograms per day for women[^11]
- Up to 800 micrograms during pregnancy[^11]
- 500 micrograms during breast feeding[^11]
Methionine synthase deficiency / folate trap[^11]
- Note if we don't have much methionine synthase, you will accumulate 5-methyl THF ;[^11]
- Not passing methyl group to B12 and then homocysteine[^11]
- So you trap the THF in that form!!! functionally - a folate deficiency bc cannot form other forms; so we have megaloblastic anemia + homocysteinuria[^11]
5,10-methylene THF reductase deficiency to make 5-methyl THF ... also homocystinuria bc we can't make it[^11]
- No folate trap. we're still able to do other stuff in our cycle, no megaloblastic anemia[^11]

## Highlights for -MMT Childhood Obesity_San Giovanni
- BMI - not ideal but gold standard screen that's super easy. - a tipping off point and low cost. for kids - in percentiles bc kids are always growing[^12]
	- Overweight - 85-95%[^12]
	- Class 1 obesity 95-120% , BMI 30-34.9[^12]
	- Class 2 = 120-140% , 35-39.9[^12]
	- Class 3 = 140+ , of 95tile , 40+ BMI[^12]
- Under 2 yrs old? - we start, we have a weight for length from when they're born to 2 years old. and anything over 97% is concerning[^12]
- Fat mass - body's defense against starvations, the setpoint in the brain defends the fat mass set point to hold onto fat. hard to lose weight bc it's regulated by the brain. makes it so hard ):[^12]
- Hypothalamus - energy in to energy out.[^12]
	- But dopamine and cognitive things will override our hunger signals!!![^12]
	- Also the prefrontal cortex stops us when we're full! but kids often dont have that all the way yet. hard for kids to know to stop eating[^12]
- If we have one concern, refer early to intensive health behavioral lifetyle treatment, NO WATCHFUL WAITING[^12]
	- Intensive health behavioral + lifestyle treatment + MI , then supplement with pharmacotherapy(12+ yo) options if that's the case. then lastly surgery if nothing else[^12]
	- SMART goals = Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Based[^12]
- GLP1 agonists -semaglutide/liraglutide - slows food in digestive track - 5-16% decrease in BMI - but CI in pts w aversion to needles, hx of pancreatitis , personal hx of this thyroid + multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome 2[^12]
- Phentermine/topiramate ER - NE reuptake inhibitor, modulation of GABA receptors, CIs are CV dz, uncontroled htn , anxiety, glaucoma, etc.[^12]
- Orlistat - a lipase inhibitor blocking fat absorption but not a good med to be on ): - chronic malabsorption syndrome, cholestasis , liver dz, or renal impair[^12]
- Setmelanotide - very specific; melanocortin 4 receptor agonist, to treat people with this specific POMC deficiency or *bardet biedl* syndrome might cause obesity - CI of depression tho ): -[^12]
- Roux en Y gastric bypass - connect the gastric pouch to the small intestine[^12]
- Gastric sleeve with removing the portion of stomach[^12]
- TEEN-LABs - for youth undergoing surgery. reduction great outcomes.[^12]
	- Many vitamin deficiencies post-surgery CI!!!! - iron, b12, risk of anemia + bone mineral density loss[^12]
- Lab work!!![^12]
	- CMP – kidney, liver, fasting glucose[^12]
	- • HbA1c[^12]
	- • Lipid panel[^12]
	- • +/- TSH/T4 - thyroid more common in adults, family hx[^12]
	- • Genetics testing - from infancy !!![^12]
- HTN is higher rate, we need to make sure to get it every child 3+ yo ... less than 13 years old... we do it via percentiles. anything over 95% is concerning.[^12]
- Diabetes Diagnosis: FBG ≧126 • Random ≧200 with classic hyperglycemia symptoms • HbA1c ≧ 6.5 • Should have 2nd confirmation test prior to starting medication[^12]
	- Treat metformin as adults[^12]
- Dyslipidemia - teens will get atherosclerosis - screen early on!!, btween 9-11 yo and then after puberty[^12] ![[when begin statin.png]][^12]
- NAFLD - in kids with obesity - presenting with abdominal pain- risk for CV dz, sleep apnea veryyyyy important, CPAP[^12]
- Orthopedic comorbidities - SCFE - very common hip + knee pain, stress on growth plate will cause slippage[^12]
- Idiopathic intracranial htn - higher in females, inc venous pressure, CSF, huge headaches.[^12]

## Highlights for -MMT Pediatric Pharmacology_Blumer
- $ !!! Greater pharmacokinetic variability in pediatric pts - just mostly focus on this![^13]
	- Absorption: ↑ gastric pH, delayed gastric emptying[^13]
	- Distribution: ↑ total body water, decreased plasma protein binding[^13]
	- Metabolism: ↓ phase I & II enzyme activity in neonates; ∆’s w/ age[^13]
	- Excretion: ↓ GFR & tubular secretion in neonates; ↑ w/ age[^13]
- Sulfonamides, ethyelene glycol of GOLDMARK - can give rise to kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy), where bilirubin is displaced from plasma and go to the brain[^13]
	- - Bilirubin also eliminated by glucoronide conugation by UGT1A1, goes up, kernicterus AS WELL! = encephalopathy[^13]
	- ceftriaxone is a huge example of this 
- Chloramphenicol - babies don't have the enzymes that can add on the sugars, causes *grey baby syndrome* from deficient glucoronidation[^13]
- Adult dosing = based on body weight.... but we cannot do that for kids due to differences in organ system dev. very little data about the safety and data of this[^13]
- IM or SQ administration - remember that muscles in infants preterms is minimal so avoid IM unless in emergencies[^13]
- Percutaneous absorption - increased due to underdeveloped epidermal barrier, accessible but at risk of toxicity - topical corticosteroids[^13]
- The acid secretion begins soon after birth - pH 1-3 in 24 hours, in premies more slow.[^13]
- Higher pH = higher serum concentrations of acid labile drugs like nafcillin[^13]
- Delayed gastric emptying - prolonged 24-48 hrs, will be slow in prematures so increased absorption[^13]
- Bc of more water , administer MORE than usual water soluble drugs like aminoglycosides, which has much higher distribution, give higher loading dose.[^13]
- Protein binding - expression is generally LOWer in infants... total drug binding capacity is lower. so rise in free drug toxicity like in *acidic drugs like NSAIDs or lipophilic drugs*[^13]
	- Total body fat = lower. = issue for lipid soluble drugs[^13]
	- Drugs distributed in breast milk - causes neonatal exposure. most drugs do pass but not sufficient enough concentration... note but CNS drugs aree often lipid soluble and accumulate.[^13]
	- Many enzymes reach near-adult levels in the first year[^13]
- Theophylline - in the past used to treat apnea of prematurity - stimulates respiration, A1 and A2a antagonist, indirect adrenergic agonists, inhibits cAMP phosphoodiesterase[^13]
	- Eliminated thru renal excretions + expression of metabolizing enzymes is huge[^13]
	- Decreased kidney functions w neonats + poor. metabolism = theophylline toxicity[^13]
	- Caffeine = related to it, more safe. but very long half life[^13]
 Note  - children have higher metabolic rates between 1-2 years... and can be faster than adults. they decrease over time to adult levels[^13]
- Toddlers have higher GFR than adults = require increased drug doses[^13]
- Most drugs would have mg/kg - in pediatric doses - but this assumes linear relationship between weight + dose, NOT always accurate; nonlinear relationships establish how a dose relates to body weight[^13]
	- $ !!!!! on the test - we will be dosing based on surface area BSA = more likely to be adequate + accurate but in reality we'd be dosing based on mg/kg[^13]
- Anticholinergic toxidromes - big, hot, dry fast - associated with atropine/oxybutynin but more common in other meds.[^13]
- Cholinergic toxidromes - SLUDGE - BBB bradycardia, bronchospasms, etc.[^13]
- Sympathomimetics - tachy, diaphoresis, mydriasis, agitation/seizures[^13]
- Opioids - resp depression, sedation, brady[^13]

## Highlights for -MMT Fuel Metabolism in Neonates I+II
- Nucleotide metabolism[^14]
	- Just know the rate limiting enzyme - carbamoyl phospate synthetase II CPS II[^14]
- Pyrimidines - CPS II is Rate limiting thing.[^14]
	- CPS I enzyme is for the urea cycle. recall that this will tie into this,[^14]
	- Creates the carbomoyl phosphate in the mitochondrial matrix.[^14]
	- CPS II will make it in the cytoplasm.[^14]
	- 2 ATP are required for pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis + one for PRPP generation[^14]
	- 3 Total ATP for each pyrimidine mononucleoside + 2 more ATP to generate the tri phosphate form[^14]
- Purines = shorter name, bigger structure, need more aTP[^14]
	- GPAT is rate limiting enzyme - glutamine PRPP amidotransferase[^14]
	- 5 ATP are required for purine nucleotide synthesis + one for PRPP generation = 6 Total ATP for each purine mononucleoside + 2 more to reach the tri phosphate form[^14]
	- So 8 ATP per nucleotide needed.[^14]
- Pentose phosphate pathway[^14]
	- Need ribose 5 phosphate (from PPP)[^14]
	- NADPH required for deoxyNTP fomation (from the nucleotide making) and FA synthesis. this is a huge energetic pathway for synthesizing stufff.[^14]
	- Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase rate limiting - glucose 6 phosphate an intermediate of glycolysis can also enter into this pathway -> make NADPH[^14]
- How to get ATP into these fetal cells - uptake the blood glucose from ma. most turn into pyruvate via glycolysis in cytoplasm, which then turns to acetyl coA in the mitochondria[^14]
	- Third trimester - mother's hormonal, making more steady blood glucose thru the placenta[^14]
	- Mom gets increased insulin resistance! due to this - insulin and glucose will rise in bloodstream, so fetus will start storing more fuels as glycogen + fat in the liver[^14]
	- Note - insulin stimulates uptake in some tissues, but not the liver. it's tissue specific bc the insulin responsive GLUT is only in adipose/ skeletal muscle tissue[^14]
- When glucose comes in , it needs to get activated with UDP glucose, phosporylated and converted to glucose 1 P -> UDP glucose, then glycogen synthase stimulated by glucose.[^14]
	- Excess glucose can be converted to oxaloacetate and actyl coA -> citrate[^14]
	- Citrate buildup = signals that we have enough energy, get's shuttled out into cytoplasm , put back into OAA + Acetyl coA, which will help make all those FATS[^14]
	- Palmitate (acetyl coA carboxylase) -> malonyl coA which shuts off beta oxidation[^14]
	- Acetyl coA can make cholesterol with HMG CoA reductase -> mevalonate -> cholesterol[^14]
- Hexokinase/glucokinase in liver/pancratic b cells[^14]
- Endogenous transport of TAG as VLDL - cholesterol and the TAG both gets packed in the outer layer[^14]
	- Apo B100 -> going to peripheral blood stream , picks up the apoE and ApoC2 (activates the LPL on capillary walls on the target tissues)[^14]
	- Then the tAGs get broken into FAs , like in the adipose tissues breaking them up from it and storing them again.[^14]
	- When it loses apoc2 -> IDL not VLDL[^14]
	- IDL will interact with hepatic triglyceride lipase, which depletes the rest of the triglycerides, which makes LDL.[^14]
- Only exception LDL apo b100 will be interacting with LDL[^14]
- Skeletal muscle cells do not respond to the glucagon! from kid getting hungry but they do respond to epinephrine!!![^14]
- Glucagon + epinephrine both will make cAMP via their G protein signals.[^14]
	- Break down of glycogen = phosphorylation cascade, eventually glucose gets released g-1P from the big glycogen -> isomerized into glucose 6 phosphate.[^14]
	- That glucose 6 phosphate is used in the muscles but in the liver we express glucose.6 phosphatase, which makes free glucose, which can maintain that homeostasis in the bloodstream again.[^14]
	- Normal sensor function = response to anoxia, stimulation, etc during birth -> epinephrine response as stress[^14]
- In the neonate - we have a harder time maintaining glucose homeostasis bc of smaller liver vs brain- they have an enhanced capacity of using ketone bodies!!! from the breakdown of FAs[^14]
	- Carnitine shuttle system will get long chain FAs from cytoplasm -> mt matrix where b-ox occurs.[^14]
	- FA + coA -> activated form , and then get them into the carnitine exchange to get them into the shuttle[^14]
	- Exchange coA with carnitine with CPT I , the key enzyme for FA oxidation. inhibited by malonyl coA.[^14]
	- Carnitine acyl carnitine translocase will carry it in, and then reexchange for coa.[^14]
- Beta oxidation = oxidation, hydration, oxidation, thiolysis[^14]
	- Mitochondrial HMG coA synthase[^14]
	- Makes ketone bodies[^14]
	- Acetoacetate, acetone, β-hydroxy- butyrate[^14]
- Lactose synthase in the golgi membrane of the alveolar cells make lactose from glucose, by getting Glucose 1 phosphate -> UDP glucose -> UDP galactose with epimerase + glucose => lactose this all happens in mammary gland.[^14]
	- Oligosaccharides of the milk - more of an immune role[^14] Major lipid component of breast milk - neonates get more lipids than the adult[^14]
	- Lactose -> galactose + glucose monomers via lactase.[^14]
		- Has a beta 1,4 linkage[^14]
- Secondary lactase def -> results from infection like rotavius, celiac dz, crohn dz[^14]
- Galactose -> converted into glucose 1-p + UDP glucose -> galactose 1 phosphate uridyl transferase will make it into UDP-galactose + glucose 1 phosphate (goal was to make this! for glycolysis) -> epimerase will make the UDP galactose into UDP glucose for the cycle again[^14]
- Foremilk - less fat , addresses thirst[^14]
- Hindmilk - more fat, addresses hunger[^14]
- The ingested FA are pulled into small intestine epithelial cells, repackaged. then put into chylomicrons.[^14]
	- Chylomicrons Apo b48 - gets apo e and apo C2 (activates LPL to degrade it into FA + glycerol)[^14]
	- After we have chylomicron remnants, apo E Exits bloodstream and go back to liver for processing[^14]
- ![[apolipoprotein summary.png]][^14]
	- LCAT - HDL maturation factor[^14]
	- Taggin exogenous particles = apo b48 like chylomicrons.[^14]
- Essential amino acids are gonna be arg + cys for infants + children![^14]
- Methionine cycle - [^14] All do transmination step then we get oxidative deamination and then urea cycle with extra nitrogen.[^14]
- Urea cycle - process ammonia thru 5 enzymes[^14]![[urea cycle.png]][^14]
- Catabolism methionine - does NOT follow that transamination step - super important bc makes SAM the methyl carrier.[^14]![[methionine catabolism.png]][^14]
- Homocysteine can make the alpha ketobutyrate + cysteine (meaning for adults, it's nonessential but for neonates we just need more of that)[^14]
- ![[phe tyrosine metabolism.png]][^14]
- We need to know phenylalanine hydroxylase + fumarylacetonacetate hydrolase bc these are screened of[^14]
	- PKU + tyrosemia type 1[^14]
	- Remember homogentisate oxidase = usually less severe; called alkaptinuria.[^14]
- All branched chain AAs will be processed by branched chain alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase.[^14]
	- Recall that valine gets to go to proponyl coa -> gluconeogenic[^14]
	- Leucine + isoleucine is ketogenic ; makes acetyl coa[^14]
	- Maple syrup disease is a big thing bc the enzyme has many parts[^14]
	- Have fructose coming in @ 6 mos[^14]
	- Enters the glycolysis as DHAP + G3P[^14]
	- Extra enzymes = fructokinase -> fructose 1 phosphate, then it will split in half by fructose 1 phosphate aldolase -> DHAP + glyceraldehyde (which turns into G3P via phosphorylation)[^14]
	- We skip that phosphofructose kinase step that's usually impacted by insulin[^14]
- Essential fructosuria - fructokinase def - benign - can end up with more fructose in urine[^14]
- Hereditary fructose intolerance- aldolase B AKA fructose 1 phosphate aldolase = we cann't process that fructose from fructose 1 phosphate!!![^14]
- MODY2 = glucokinase - pancreatic beta cells cannot sense glucose levels, no insulin release![^14]

- What happens with severe protein malnutrition -[^5]
	- Kwashiorkor - bilateral edema due to malnutrition[^5]
	- Severe protein malnutrition • Marked muscle atrophy • Abdominal distention (+/- hepatomegaly) • Think, dry, peeling skin • Dry, hypopigmented hair • Skin lesions/dermatitis • Growth retardation • Bilateral extremity swelling • More than just dietary protein deficiency[^5]
- Marasmus - z score <-3, and use the weight for height measure. no edema, wasting syndrome; but usually occur together with kwashiorkor[^5]
	- Extra note about ZINC - huge for stature, cofactor for alk phosphatase, so if it's low, suspect malnutrition.[^5]
	- Refeeding syndrome - hyperglycemic bc the fluids are low. as they get mroe and more, the fluids will shift, so ions will intracellular, getting precipateous drops, and then thymine is deficient.[^5]
		- Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, salt + fluid retention, thiamine def[^5]
		- Cardiac arrhythmia, fluid overloaded heart failure, encephalopathy[^5]
- Parenteral nutrition - helpful as life saving measure - complex solution = only use when no reason to give enteral nutrition(GI system is nonfunctional), given right into the junction of SVC/IVC, the RA... thru a central line.[^5]

- Nutritional programming - in which nutrition based dietary intake/behaviors[^6]
- Pattern of low birth weight -> stunted -> small pregnant woman -> low birth weight/pre term. this is a perpetual cycle[^6]
- Vitamin d - a common concern with infants, innate immunity ; supplement w 400 IU / day until they're weaned to at least 1 L/day or 1 qt/day[^6]
	- All non-breastfed make sure if they get less than 1000 mL / day of vitamin D fortified formula/whole milk , they need 400 IU/day sup[^6]

- Alternative height measure for nonmobile patients, equation to extrapolate to a height. like from tibia length[^6]
	- Infants - 2 yrs ; use the WHO growth chart - weight length, head for age, and then weight for length curve[^6]
	- Specialty growth chart - premies, corrections for GA , down syndrome, turner, CP, etc.[^6]
	- For premies, we do weight thru 24 months, bringing them back onto the growth chart., doing some corrections.[^6]
- Another reason for poor growth = heart disease / malignancy taking up too much energy[^6]
- Growth chart[^6]
	- Plot on the correct growth chart (WHO or CDC or special)[^6]

## Highlights for -MMT Prenatal& Neonatal Nutrition I+II
- Exclusive breast fed for 6 month[^7]
	- 6-12 month still breastfed w gradual intro solids[^7]
	- Benefits breastfeeding beyond 1 yr[^7]
- Phase 1 embryonic phase of organogenesis - conception - 5 wks[^7]
	- Primitive gut is a cord of cells[^7]
- Phase 2 rapid growth + differentiation[^7]
	- Gut tube w/ lumen + movement of fluid!! lumen opens.[^7]
	- Elongation, dev of crypts, villi, microvilli, swallowing of amniotic fluid,[^7]
	- Blockage of amniotic fluid flow inhibits development ![^7]
- Phase 3 - active diff - from late gestation to *early feeding @ birth*[^7]
	- Increase mitotic activity + increased apoptosis[^7]
	- Developmental remodeling in anticipation of feeding[^7]
	- Switching from amniotic fluid in the gut to human milk if possible[^7]
- Phase 4+5 rapid growth + differentiation[^7]
	- Clustered - after enteral feeding begins + continue thru late infancy[^7]
	- Deepen crypts, widening villi, futher maturation[^7]
	- Antigen load increases. so innate + specific aq immunity develops[^7]
	- Baby goes thru phase 1-3 before birth ... basically amniotic fluid is providing 15% of fetal nutritional requirements + growth factors[^7]
	- If infant born prematurely... does not shift the phases of development, just means we need to make sure they develop outside of womb[^7]
- No amniotic fluid growth factors, but the human milk can make up for lack of growth factors... the issue w/ formula is that it lacks these.[^7]
	- • Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) - maturation and repair of the intestines - this will increase with advancing gestational age, but works better in synergy with the rest.[^7]
		- EGF lvls in milk of moms w/ very preterm infants are SUPER HIGH!! - ur body knows you need to make more[^7]
	- • Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) - tissue growth[^7]
	- • Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) -tissue growth[^7]
	- • Transforming Growth Factor α (TGF-α) - maturation and repair of the intestines[^7]
	- JAK-STAT Receptors[^7]
	- Interleukins (IL)[^7]
	- • Human Growth Factor[^7]
	- • erythropoeitin - epo - Erythropoesis intestinal dev[^7]
		- GCPRs too = somatostatin + calcitronin - growth regulation + neuronal dev of GI[^7]
		- EGF receptors will bind EGF, Hb-EGF, TGF-alpha - essential - to express occludin + claudin to stop the leakiness of the gut - tight junctions for the gut barrier[^7]
- Math1 - central line for goblet cells, enteroendocrine + paneth cell maturity[^7]
- Antiapoptotic pathways[^7]
- Downreg - proinflammatory cytokines[^7]
- Necrotizing enterocolitis - in 1/10 low birth weight individuals - more often with formula fed ppl[^7]
	- Unknown, variable, bacterial infection of the leaky gut[^7]
	- Toxic shock like thing - takes blood to the heart, away from the GI tract, hypoxic death of GI tract - necrosis in the colon.[^7]
	- Plasma taurine + cysteine are higher - so better bile conjugation + antioxidant synthesis in human milk[^7]
- If the infant takes up more protein, like more than 11.0 g (FDA formula standards), we will have solute load in kidney - so the filtrate will invoke an early rush of water into lumen - loss of water!! -> infant dehydration via too much protein from cow's milk[^7]
- In formulas - more MCFA vs more lipids in VLCFA packaged as TGs already.... hard to duplicate total lipid content[^7]
	- Adding DHA though is helpful with brain development even when you're giving formulas.[^7]
	- Benefits - lactase is in your gut from the beginning so the human milk .[^7]
	- Oligosaccharides prevent antigens from attaching to gut epithelium!![^7]
	- Support growth of lactobaccillus bifidus, increases acidity to compensate for low production of HCl[^7]
- Breast milk - ca and phosphates lower + iron + zn decline during lactation[^7]
- But absorption are facilitate by its binding to digestible proteins[^7]
- Lactoferrin in human milk - binds iron molecules to help absorption[^7]
- Low in vitamin D... with increasing vita D deficiency in moms, uptick in rickets in babies! recommend vitamin D3.[^7]
- Low vitamin K content too in human milk. please give after birth to prevent hemorrhagic dz[^7]
- Colostrum - immature breast milk, still has cells[^7]
	- Neutrophils[^7]
	- Some lymphcytes[^7]
	- SIgA + IgG[^7]
- Mature breast milk - has[^7]
	- 80%+ macrophages, activated,[^7]
	- Capable of making 12+ growth factors + cytokines[^7]
- 2 suppliers make up most of the dollars for infant formula. fucked up[^7]
	- No we didn't solve the problem - WIC doesnt allow parental choice![^7]
