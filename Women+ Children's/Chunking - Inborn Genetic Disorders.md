- Type 2 glycogen storage disorder, Pompe disease (Lysosomal acid ⍺-1,4 glucosidase)[^1]
	- Treatment = enzyme replacement therapy[^1]
	- Glucose levels remain normal bc the metabolic defect affects glycogen degradation in LYSOSOMES, not the maintaining blood glucose levels in the cytoplasm.[^1]
- Leigh syndrome can be impacted by - pyruvate carboxylase (autosomal recessive), pyruvate dehydrogenase (X-linked), and the Fo subunit of ATP synthase (mitochondrial inheritance) can all be mutated!!![^1]

	- To treat acidosis - Oral supplementation of sodium bicarbonate or citrate[^1]
![[biotin cycle.png]]
- Biotin cycle: homocarboxylase synthase(made of 4 enzymes) adds free biotin to the apoforms of carboxylases .. and then freeing it once it's been degraded; B7 essential. any reduction or defect in holocarboxylate synthase results in metabolic acidosis[^1]
- Biotin is freed from associated protein from diet -> and then activated with ATP to make biotinyl[^1]
	- Gluconeogenesis - pyruvate carboxylase, req biotin[^1]
	- Lipid metabolism acetyl coA carboxylase req biotin[^1]
	- Amino acid catabolism 3-methylcrotonyl coa carboxylase req biotin[^1]

	- - Infants with maple syrup urine disease _cannot be breastfed_ and their levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine need to be carefully monitored (consider liver transplant)[^1]
- methionine cyle = Transulfuration - homocysteine produced may condense with serine to form ⍺-ketobutyrate and cysteine[^1]
	- Propionyl coA to succinyl coA- ⍺-ketobutyrate is converted to propionyl CoA which then forms succinyl CoA[^1]

	- MTHFR mutation - - Methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase is essential for the regeneration of 5-methyl THF from 5,10-methylene THF, just treat by supplementing 5-methyl THF[^1]![[odor s in AA catabolism.png]][^1]

	- High arginine - arginase[^1]
	- High citrulline + argininosuccnase - smaller levels (really the argininosuccinate, which the citrulline can turn into, is excretable, soluble and taken away from body!)[^1]
	- High orotate = OTC[^1]
- Secondary hyperammonemia can happen with organic acidemia - bc it's acidic environment, and enzymes of urea cycle function best in a basic one.[^1]
- If you can't make ketones w low blood glucose, it means we have FA ox def[^1]

	- Reciprocal - flip floping chomosomes. from breaking or recomb involving nonhomologues.[^3]- Non-reciprocal - one's giving the other's not[^3]
- malsegregation of chromosomes in Meiosis I; so instead of a bivalent pattern, we make a quadrivalent pattern, like a cross to make sure it splits appropriately[^3]
- Happens in that cross as well , but adjacent segregation instead of alternate.[^3]
![[segregation adjacent+alternate.png]]
- Robertsonian translocation - 2 acrocentric chromosomes fusing near the centromere, loss of the short arm or the P (petite) arm. - ends up with 45 chromosome, like maybe 13 and 14 are stuck together.[^3]
