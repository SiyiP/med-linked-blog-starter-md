## Highlights for -HRR Congenital Infections_Kasman
- Perinatal transmission - directly from mom to kid between 22nd wk gestation and 1 wk post-birth[^8]
	- 1# factor of adverse outcome. = Mother is experiencing infection with the pathogen for the first time during the pregnancy - no prior immunity built up, no antibodies transplacentally, pathogen number is higher[^8]
	- Perinatally, maternal infections late in pregnancy = worse outcomes.[^8]
- Congenital infections w/ greatest risk in first trimester = all attacks the CNS, which is what's forming at this time. - all can lead to fetal + perinatal death, perm dev defects[^8]
- CMV - sometimes no illness @ birth but only post-natal consequences(deafness) developped among months - years, lifelong, reactivation[^8]
	- 90+% are asymptomatic @ birth, see hep, rash, retinitis + calcifications if symptomatic.[^8]
	- Treat = valaganciclovir if symptomatic but no significant diff in long term ; no prevention[^8]
- Rubella - eradicated from USA - # 1 cause of congenital deaf blindness world wide; follows rubella in 1st trimester[^8]
	- Blueberry muffin spots, low birth weight, pneumonitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, hepatosplenomegaly[^8]

	- **Prevent with just one shot BEFORE pregnancy!**[^8]
- Toxoplasma gondii - sometimes no illness @ birth but only post-natal consequences[^8]
	- Triad - chorioretinitis(inflammation of choroid + retina), intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus (water on brain, excess CSF)[^8]
	- Avoid exposures during pregnancy (undercooked meat which can have cysts, soil/litter), and pre-existing immunity from mom. anti-toxoplasma drugs too[^8]
	- Transplacental transmission happens - in any time, but greatest severity during first trimester[^8]
- Zika virus - flavivirus by mosquitos / semen[^8]
	- Microcephaly, brain dmg, blindness, seizures, swallowing difficulties, worsen post-birth[^8] 

***Greatest risk in 2nd + 3rd trimester; quite diverse.[^8]***
- Hep C - mom to kid late pregnancy to during birthing process[^8]
	- Co infection with HIV doubles the risk[^8]

	- Up to 30% spontaneously clear it by 3 yo.[^8]
- Listeria monocytogenes - preg women 10x more likely to get it ! lunch meats etc.[^8] **this is transmitted transplacentally, hard to prevent transmission if pregnant mom is found poz**
	- Miscarriage/stillbirth, srs or fatal infections[^8]
	- Prevent - avoid unpasteurized dairy / deli meats, may be treatable w antibiotic[^8]
	- Can be treated with CSF or treating the mom[^8]
- Parvovirus B19 - single stranded DNA, very hardy in environment[^8] **hard to prevent transmission if pregnant mom is found poz**

	- Fetal severe anemia, cardiac failure + *hydrops fetalis*[^8]
	- Viral myocarditis[^8]
- Treponema pallidum - congenital syphilis[^8]
	- **Anti-treponemal tests which are specific for the spirochete that causes syphilis, and the non-treponemal tests (RPR, VRDL)... the anti-treponemal will sTAY positive, while the RPR/VRDL will only indicate acute.**
	- On the rise, stillbirth, premie or clinical. only severe cases = clinically apparent at birth[^8]
	- *Thick pale placenta*, rhinitis/snuffles, hepatomegaly + macupapular rash 2-3 wks post birth[^8]
	- Treat mom w penicillin G ASAP in pregnancy as possible[^8]
	- High chance of vertical transmission if primary syphilis or secondary. less and less as time goes on.[^8]
		- Note - early / latent (no symptoms) - will decrease in time after year 1[^8]
- HIV - poor weight gain + same opportunistic infections in adults[^8]
	- 25% transmission no intervention and <1 with any treatments or C section by 38 wks or no breastfeeding/ ARV[^8]

- HSV and VSV - severe skin lesions, systemic infections, very common but now less bc of vaccinations.[^8] **hard to prevent transmission if pregnant mom is found poz**
	- Maternal Ab provide protection in established infections. C section only when visible lesions.[^8]
	- don't recommend any screening during pregnancy
	- Acyclovir reduces mortality but many survivors have perm brain dmg ):[^8]
- Hep B , HIV - chronic initially asymptomatic that are lifetime[^8]
	- Hep b - asymptomatic @ birth, but high risk of chronic HBV infection without treatment, so lifetime risk of hepatocellular carcinoma ;[^8]
	- Tenofovir - give to mom with high viral loads(Hep E antigen marker) in 3rd trimester.[^8]
	- *Note - no c section bc blood exposure.[^8]*
- N. gonorrhoae , C. trachomatis, HPV - symptomatic eyes + resp track infections, or longer in case of HPV[^8] 
	- Gonorrhea - routine erythromycin ointment in each eye at birth to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum[^8]
		- Can disseminate to which you treat with ceftriaxone.[^8]
	- Chlamydia trachomatis - D-K in STD[^8]
		- Show with conjunctivitis + pneumonia ; asymptomatic til 5-14 days post delivery[^8]
		- Need systemic antibiotics, azithromycin single dose.[^8]
	- HPV - asymptomatic @ birth, then 2-5 they get hoarseness by recurrent resp papillomatosis[^8]

## Highlights for -HRR Viral Exanthams_Kasman
- Measles is caused by a paramyxovirus / rubeola! Chickenpox is caused by a herpesvirus, Erythyma infectiosum is caused by Parvovirus B19, Rubella by a matonavirus (previously a togavirus, but recently given its own family) and smallpox by a pox virus.
- longest incubation period is only 4 wks long, mulloscum. everything else incubation period too short! 
- Prototype exantham - measles - diffusely distributed, blanchable, erythematous macules (flat) and papules (raised) is the classic picture[^10]
- -viral *enantham* = eruptive disease on a mucosal surface[^10]
- Prototype measles rash = morbiliform[^10]
- Rashes = late manifestations of adaptive immune responses, basically virus already thru the blood and cells are attacking it in the skin.[^10]
![[Exanthams chart 1.png]] ![[Exanthams Chart 2.png]]
	- All pox viruses - pustular[^10]
- Rubeola / measles - "5 day measles" - paramyxovirus, morbillivirus, -ss RNA[^10]
	- Enveloped w HA and fusion protein spikes, no NA.[^10]
	- Syncytia + viral shed , then hematogenous spread in prodromal period[^10]
	- 3 Cs , prodromal/before the rash, 3 days of it[^10] - **3 days of 3 Cs!!!**
		- Coryza (mucous inflammation in nose) , cough, conjunctivitis[^10]
		- Photophobia , sometimes koplik spots white salt appearance in mucus membrane[^10]
		- All secretions = infectious[^10]
	- Immunologic rxn to virus in capilary endothelium -> dilation and extravasation of red cells = blanchable[^10]
	- Common - superinfection + pneumonia giant cells.[^10]
	- Very rare - encephalitis, likely autoimmune, deaf/blindness. or neurodegen disease wild measles before age 2[^10]
	- Measles paradox - we get robust long life protective immunity to measles but profound leukopenia during acute infection bc kills memory lymphocytes[^10]
		- We need to do dx based on clinical symptoms, confirm w/ anti measles IgM pcr.[^10]
	- Supportive therapy + Vita A ... but we give a live attenuated vaccine @ 12-15 mon and booster @ 4-6 yrs[^10]
- *note - rubeola of measles is very similar to rubella, but rubella is shorter in term and mild/undetectable in children.*[^10]
- Rubella - "german measles/3-day measles"- + ssRNA enveloped, one stable subtype called rubivirus[^10] - 
	- Winter-spring.[^10]
	- Very mild, rash is mainly first evidence of dz, adults might have prodromal phase where there's malaise![^10]
	- **Forschheimer**'s sign - enantham of dull red petechiae on soft palate, in about 20%of pts.[^10]
	- Rash appears with the adaptive immune response[^10]
	- **vaccine for mom must BE BEFORE pregnancy**
	- Migratory arthritis post-rash, due to immune complexes + t cells[^10]
	- Thrombycytopenia + hemorrhagic diathesis is rare[^10]
	- Post-infectious encephalitis - CD8+ T cell mediated[^10]
		- Congenital Rubella syndrome - CRS - huge risk, infection in first 2 wks, super early, she didn't even know shes pregnant.[^10]
			- Blueberry muffin, low birth weight, pneumonitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, hepatosplenomegaly[^10]
			- Classic triad - microcephaly, PDA, cataracts.[^10]
- Mumps - paramyxovirus -ssRNA, viral envelope mediate attachment to sialic acid,[^10]
	- HA NA spikes, cytotoxic F protein[^10]
	- Winter spring[^10]
	- Goes to salivary glands, CNS, gonad.[^10]
	- No rash, then we get swelling of salivary parotid gland due to necrosis + edema + infiltrates.[^10]
	- A vaccine[^10]
- Parvovirus B19 "fifth disease, erythema infectiosum", small, naked virus w ssDNA genome, hardy[^10] = slapped cheek rash
	- Resp spread, mild disease in immunocompetent kids[^10]
	- Profound anemia in ppl who are congental anemia or immunocompromised[^10]
	- Can cause sickle cell / thalassemia compromise, aplastic crisis , protracted anemia long term.[^10]
	- 50% of adults have arthropathy , lasting months + lymphadenopathy / splenomegaly by immune complex depo[^10]
	- Rosy cheeks - facial erythema and lacy reticular rash spread to rest of body[^10]
	- Bind to group P antigen/globosides on erythroid progen, erythroblast, megakaryocytes / endothelial cells = will stop hematogenesis.[^10]
	- B19 IgM/IgG antibody[^10]
- **Roseola infantum - exanthem subitum - HHV 6,7[^10]**
	- 6 mos - 4 yrs of age exclusively ... everyone seroconverts by 5 yrs[^10]
	- Establish latency, asymptomatic shedding for life.[^10]
	- High fever 3-5 days , breaks then rash - common cause febrile seizures. disappears in 48 hrs. complications rare.[^10]
	- **sudden rash and high fever in child under 2 is most likely this**
![[Varicella v variola.png]]
- Chickenpox VZV - - **varicella** = worse on trunk; shingles, a painful rash caused by chickenpox virus herpes zoster... stops at midline.[^10] - we can see it on the tongue, 
	- neurotropic, neurological symptoms. The give away is the **unilateral nature of the symptoms and unilateral vesicular lesions.**
- Vaccinia - used as a smallpox vaccine - evolved from cowpox, passage of skin on calves[^10]
	- Replicates locally, makes single pox + heals leaving a scar.[^10]
- Mpox/monkey pox - very close to variola, similar symptoms but not severe.[^10]
	- Prairie dogs in NA/[^10]
	- Umbilicated lesions like smallpox[^10]
- Alaskapox - emerging, alaska, 1st docu in 2015, nothing person to person yet bc rodents zoonotic, but 1 seen death.[^10]
- Molluscum contagiosum - seen in kids - itchy small pustules, skin to skin contacts + can be seen as STI, mild dz[^10]
	- Umbilicated papule.[^10]
	- Necrotic center = molluscum bodies, hypertrophied thing[^10]
	- Goes away on own, or we can ablate it off[^10]
- note - herpes simplex 1 or 2 = Painful vesicles that recur in the same place  
- note - if it looks unlike anyting else, painless lesions = warts if they are lighter in color

## Highlights for -SFP Forensic Pediatrics
- SUID - sudden unexpected infant death , hot spot 2-4 months, less than 1 yr of age. most of the times, we call it undetermined.[^4]
- Unknown = SIDs = the same thing basically. = sudden + unexpected death under 1 yr of age; we didn't know what happened. just call it unknown ; stuff predispositions; SIDs in prev siblings, low SocEc group, sleep, brain stem abnormality etc.[^4]
- Workup of unexpected infant death - autopsy, xray, cultures, toxicology, metabolic screen - maybe cardiac channelopathy genetic testing; we note lividity pattern - where the blood settles/blanches on the kid, sleeping environment, etc. petechiae on autopsy is nothing specific[^4]
- Abuse - assailant often known like shaken baby syndrome , usually <4 yo child. we're mandated reporters ; know what happened with findings. head trauma accounts for most deaths 1k-1500 per year[^4]
- What's suspicious for abuse? multiple impacts, odd locations, patterns like: contusions/bruises behind ear, palm of hand, multiple foci on head, posterior rib fractures, torn frenulum of face / gingival injury[^4]
	- certainly fractures of **long bones!!!**
	- rib fractures **are NOT as common in CPR compared to adults**; kids ribs are less osteofied. 
- Mimickers - sinusitis - looks like ocular injuries[^4]
- Drool rash - kinda diffuse looking, looks like multiple reddish bruises.[^4]
- Traumatic alopecia - hair loss, many reasons for it - refer to derm; but some forms of pulling = hairpulling can lead to subdural hemorrhages[^4]
- Blunt head trauma = leading cause of death; when we pull back the scalp, we see hemorrhage + massive fracture[^4]
- "shaken baby syndrome" -> some controversy about if just shaking does it by itself? - just call it blunt head trauma[^4]
- Classic triad of subdural(see blood under shiny dura, due to bridging veins from skull to brain surface tear), subarachnoid(cannot wipe off), retinal hemorrhages(optic nerve has a lot of blood, similar to diabetic retinopathy); but some diseases can cause this - happens any time the head is swollen like infections[^4]
- Brain moves back and forth = think axonal injury such as retraction balls that used to be axons in stains of brain; stains of beta amyloid protein or silver stain, shaking = bruising on arms[^4]
- Chronic sequlae of head trauma/shaken baby syndrome- marked cerebral atrophy - child hospice - significant <3 dz, respiratory issues, multi system organ injury = there's no normal brain tissue, a lot of parts of the brain eaten up.[^4]
- 2nd leading cause of death = abdominal trauma, see lacerations of the livers typically bc it's bigger in kids[^4]
- Mimic for skin stuff: eczema - reddish lesions all over[^4]
- Common mimicker - sacral area hyperpigmentation = blueish green midline with other lesions going up the spine = mongolion spot, congenital melancytosis[^4]
- CPR injuries = mimics.[^4]
	 External  Facial abrasions (mask, nails) Chin contusions  Adhesive tape marks Oropharynx mucosal tears  Lip contusions/lacerations  +/- skin and musculature trauma[^4]
	- Internal Epicardial hematoma  Gastric perforation Hepatic/splenic/pancreatic injuries[^4]
- Scald - used as punishment - hand into hot water, straight line coming across , feed as well (super straight line showing where it starts)[^4]
- Mimickers for contact burns - toxic epidermal necrolysis TEN, bulbous diseases = more irregular, diaper rash[^4]
- Lethal neglect - <1 yr, inconsistent hx, look at environment, birth hx / growth charts, interviews. radiographs for any demineralization and rickets[^4]
- Large head, sunken eyes/cheeks/fontanelles, ribs , scaphoid abdomen + skin tenting. "dry and sticky" = test electrolytes - increased sodium, cl => dehydration!![^4]
- Neglect mimickers - Intestinal malabsorption  Celiac disease  Protein-losing enteropathies  Pyloric stenosis  Cystic fibrosis  Other chromosomal/metabolic diseases[^4]

## Highlights for -SFP Pediatric Tumors Batalis
- 5-14 yrs - malignancies is the 2nd leading cause of death[^5]
- Heterotopia - benign - normal tissue, where it doesn't belong ! classical example are meckel's diverticulum, outpouching of bowel, pancreatic tissue is growign inside it[^5]
- Hamartoma - benign right tissue, right place, but too much ! there's a fine line between this and benign neoplasm. uniquely, rhabdomyomas are benign tumors or neoplasms but they will regress over time unlike these.[^5]
- Hemangiomas - tumors benign! overgrowth of blood vessels, spontaneously regress, autosomal dom, disfiguring face, skin etc.[^5]
	- Associated w syndromes if larger in the face- von hippel lindau (pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, brain tumors.)[^5]
	- Sturge-weber - seizures, cognitive issues port wine stain = abnormal hemangioma[^5]
- Lymphangiomas - similar to hemangiomas in skin , deeper, but may stimulate invasive tumor, lymph channel overgrowth, not invading[^5]
	- Lymphangioma + cystic hygroma + hydrops = we most likely see congestive heart failure[^5]
- Sacrococcygeal teratoma = germ cell tumors of 3 tissues![^5]
	- 75% benign, depends on maturity ; if it's mature = more good, but if it's immature, lots of blue, not differentiated - not good.[^5]
- Erythroblastosis fetalis + extramedullary hematopoesis - seen in any fetal anemia[^5]
- Kernicterus, bilirubin in brain - has to be hemolytic anemia[^5]
- Malignancy: Mainly getting hematopoietic tumors wayyy more than adults, also CNS(getting it in lower half of brain) and soft tissue tumors[^5]
	- More embryonal primitive appearance, small, round blue cell tumors. - so primitive we can't tell what cell it is![^5]
	- Pure and genetically driven. ; they are very aggro, so they have many mutations that can be targeted - better survival rates! can show sporadic maturation and regression.[^5]
	- "blast" = immature, undifferentiated cells[^5]
- Neuroblastoma - in adrenal glands AND up and down sympathetic chain!- note that the liver takes up a lot of room in the abdomen for kids - large yellow mass seen off to the side of it[^5]
	- MYCN gene - protooncogene encodes a transcription factor;[^5]
	- Amplifications - extra chromosomal material called "double minutes" = many extra chromosomes with sooo many dots and debris in the bgd, extra survival material.[^5]
	- FISH: sees some instead of a red/green signal we might see a yellow = double minutes, extra copies.[^5]
	- Homer wright pseudorosettes - a rosette (true one has nothing in the middle); there's some light pink material in the middle! almost looks like glands[^5]
	- Catecholamines - metabolites in the URINE - if VMA or HMA increased we have a neuroblastoma[^5]
	- Blueberry muffin baby - basically we have some skin metastases. we see a bunch of dots subcutaneously where it's set up. + large abdominal mass.[^5]
	- More heterogeneous[^5]
- Pathologic grade = MKI(what % of cells are mitoses), differentiation(more differentiated is better), stroma(pink material in between, more = better) - how does it behave?[^5]
- Clinical stage = location, completeness of excision - ultimately the one we look at the most[^5]
- Age of patient - better prognosis when they're like in a few months of age[^5]
- Wilms tumor / nephroblastoma - kidneys[^5]
	- All chromosome 11[^5]
	- WAGR - wilms, aniridia(lack of iris, pupil looks HUGE), genital, cognitive issues(r-tardation) - about 30% get wilms, deletion 11p13[^5]
	- Denys-Drash - genital and renal anomalies - 90% get wilms tumors, dominant negative mutation 11p13[^5]
	- Beckwith-Wiedemann: huge organs, hemihypertrophy; 11p15.5 gene , relationship with IGF2 , there's some imprinting that goes on with insulin like growth factor = huge organs and growth![^5]
	- Abdominal mass + hematuria[^5]
	- Triphasic histology *immature cells, normal kidney tubules, and stroma = 3 layers*[^5]
	- Nephrogenic rests -stroma + tubules , some overgrowth seen on kidney **that could be a precursor to wilms**, esp with contralateral risk. gelatinous, small immature tubules and spindled pink stroma but maybe no blastomas.[^5]
	- Many circular tubules, tumors that try to make the normal stuff like spindled stroma, and blastema - small round blue = triphasic[^5]
	- Kidney, bulky, lobulated, white form and appearance pushing the borders[^5]
- Retinoblastoma - eye / in posterior retina - RB1 gene = classic tumor suppressor gene[^5]
	- Familial - bilateral, more aggro ; and more likely to have RB1 loss.[^5]
	- Osteosarcoma[^5]
	- Flexner wintersteiner rosettes - a true lumen in the middle![^5]
	- Diagnosis from white eye reflex - they have cloudy vision - seen when you shine it across, we just have this wall of white where we shoulda been seeing a reflection[^5]

## Highlights for -SFP Prematurity, Hydrops and Cystic Fibrosis_Batalis
- Bronchopulmonary dysplasia / alveolar hypoplasia - no mature alveoli, etiology unknown[^6]
	- Less than 1500 g, or 28 wks. 25% of births, basically premature disease. outcomes vary[^6]
	- Thicker septae, smaller alveoli or none[^6]
- Retinopathy of prematurity - **most common!** - much critical medical thing - have swings of oxygen changes[^6]
	- VEGF - responds when O2 low, needs more blood vessels so increase.[^6]
	- Then o2 up again at birth, and VEGF down, we will get less blood vessels again.[^6]
	- Proliferation keeps starting + stopping = poorly formed vessels -> eventually lead to bulbous aneurysms. kids in NICU will get optomology consults.[^6]
- Germinal matrix hemorrhage - feared; bleeding in the brain! 20% of these infants; Graded I-IV based on involvement, affects prognosis[^6]
	- Grade I -restricted to subependymal region[^6]
		-  Good prognosis[^6]
	-  Grade II -extension into normal sized ventricles and typically filling less than half of the ventricle - but not distend ventricles ; fill but not distend ventricles.[^6]
		-  Good prognosis[^6]
	-  Grade III -extension into dilated ventricles[^6]
		-  20% mortality[^6]
	-  Grade IV –extension into parenchyma[^6]
		-  ~90% mortality[^6]
	- More caused by swings in blood pressure! prone to rupture.[^6]
- Necrotizing enterocolitis = prematurity, low birth weight (mucosa weaker), tube feeds.[^6]
	- Seen with any infection , inflammatory mediators lead to necrosis of bowel wall. - predisposition with tube feeds that damage mucosa[^6]
	- Leads from patchy to full thickness necrosis[^6]
	- Bloody stools + bloating.[^6]
	- Stop any feeds! put on antibiotics + support with IVF[^6]
	- Complication - pneumatosis intestinalis - histologically we see a big white air bubble in the mucosa - air is dissecting. this is a sign of perforation[^6]
- Meconium aspiration = a fetal stress indication = - foul smelling, discolored amniotic fluid, resp distress most commonly in them... but can happen in anything[^6]
	- More of an obstructive phenomenon - in lungs, obstruction of airways[^6]
	- We do some ventilation and supportive therapies[^6]
- 70% of cystic fibrosis have delta F508, most severe, a frameshift deletion -[^6]
	- In the skin, the cl- is driven back INTO the cells instead of out. in other organ systems we're supposed to be sending cl- out. histo looks normal[^6]
	- Diseases seen - pseudomonas aeruginosa + burkholderia cepacia...[^6]
	- Pancreas tan and lobulated fibrotic - malabsorption with vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea. -> rectal prolapse + edema[^6]
	- Bronchiectasis- fixed dilated bronchioles. bad infections will erode thru those SMs.[^6]
	- Salivary glands are eaten away[^6]
	- Small intestines - meconium ileus, stuck inside the bowel[^6]
	- Newborn screened with immunoreactive trypsinogen.[^6]
- Hydrops - most common cause of fetal hydrops - massive edema of the baby caused by Rh incompatibility - nowadays we have non immune anemia bc we have good medicines[^6]
	- Non-immune hydrops - cardiovascular, anything causing primary HF. congenital heart diseas. like huge endocardial cushion defect[^6]
	- Non immune - primary anemias like parvovirus(RBC aplasia, washed purple cells with light rim around it) or others.[^6]
- Erythroblastosis fetalis- immature RBCs - see many immature red cells without the clearing, cytoplasm cleared, nucleus still in there.[^6]
	- esults when the fetus throws hematopoetic precursors into the circulation due to ***destruction of red blood cells by maternal antibodies***
- Extramedullary hematopoesis - seen in spleen + stuff , body's doing anything we can to make those RBCs; sinusoids empty, megakaryocytes, red/white precursors in areas outside bone marrow[^6]
	- If due to HEMOLYSIS - tearing apart these cells - we see bilirubin deposits into brain - kernicterus - long term dev delays.[^6]
- Anasarca - swelling and generalized edema[^6]

## Highlights for -SFP Congenital Anomalies and Prematurity_Batalis
- Sequences - once we see one anomaly we can see others. sometimes they're related via one thing causing the others.[^7]
- Syndrome - several groups of individuals have this same set of stuff. - like some sort of thing underlying connecting but no direct domino effects[^7]
- Genitourinary malformations - polycystic kidney disease.... horseshoe kidneys (more incidental)[^7]
- Musculoskeletal malformations - syndactyly - fusion of fingers , and sirenomelia(fusion of legs, unfortunately more genitourinary issues too) - cleft lip/palate , cleft can go up into cranial cavity, predisposing them to encephalopathy etc but mostly not that horrible[^7]
- GI malformations - atresia - absence of an opening / lack of lumen development. usually in small intestine we have intestinal atresia (proximal part bulge, distal is shrunken)[^7]
- Central nervous system - microcephaly can go either way, can happen as a malformation or a zika virus deformation.[^7]
- Anencephaly - no legitimate CNS tissue, just fibrovascular. in utero they're fine, but no survival after birth - severe malformation[^7]
- Situs inversus - mirrored internal organs - not always life threatening , higher freq of cardiac abnormalities though[^7]
- Aplasia - lack of development of a tissue. radial aplasia - part of trisomy 18 syndrome, we have no forearm joint[^7]
- Major disruption - amniotic band syndrome - amniotic membrane can wrap around, causing bloodless amputations of typically the digits[^7]
	- Comma shaped, overlapping digits - deformation with oligoamnios.[^7]
- Turner , 45x - constellation with more than one underlying etiology - cystic hydromas , webbed neck,[^7]
- Down syndrome - more acute leukemia[^7]
- Potter sequence - low on amniotic fluid - anything that leads to this = can lead to potter's sequence, and see pulmonary hypoplasia (main cause of death)[^7]
	- Oligohydramnios -> ammion nodosum, pulm hypoplasia, fetal compression, breech pres, altered faces.[^7]
	- There's growth factors in that amniotic fluid - if we're short on it, we don't stimulate the lung growth.[^7]
- Critical phase - remember that from 4-8 weeks is huge for all your organs.[^7]
- Note - dads to be should stop drinking up to 6 months before the fact for cardio issues[^7]
- Term - anything 37 weeks or later[^7]
	- Causes of prematurity - multiple gestation, chorioamnionitis, rupture of membranes[^7]
- Posterm - after 42 weeks! - unknown cause, fetal + maternal complications.[^7]
- 10th percentile or less - fetal growth restriction[^7]
	- "big for gestational age" - top 10%,[^7] Weighing more than 4000-4500 g[^7]
- Prematurity - complications respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane dz - 10% of premature births[^7]
	- Male, maternal diabetes, c section recommended.[^7]
	- Maternal diabetes - insulin suppresses surfactant production; decreased surfactant -> collapsed alveoli + resultant hypoxia[^7]
	- Treat with corticosteroids + artificial surfactant[^7]
	- Hypoxemia + co2 retention -> acidosis ; endothelial + epithelial dmg with pulm vasoconstriction + hypoperfusion of pulmonary system.[^7]
- Hyaline membrane disease - we see thick goopy pink material lay down a coating around alveoli , occurring in prematurity (lungs without surfactant AND aren't ready!) -thicker alveolar septa, o2 hard to work into the tissue.[^7]
	- Sometimes see a gray later phase as it's being cleared[^7]
	- Clinically - see ground glass appearance of lungs.[^7]
- Too much ventilator support = **complication interstitial emphysema**. if we turn on the ventilator too much we'll blow out the lung tissues, forcing too much air into it = makes a pneumothorax! popped lung[^7]

## Highlights for -SFP Pathology of the Breast I+II_Spruill
- Nipple areola complexes have the lactiferous sinuses with extension into the ducts (the milk will be excreted from such)[^9]
	- Lobular units radial from nipple to all 4 quadrants[^9]
	- Intralobular - fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, adipose tissue, vasculature[^9]
	- Interlobular stroma (between the lobules) - predominantly adipose tissue[^9]
	- Microanatomy - duct -> terminal duct lobular unit, lined by myoepithelial cells + have milk producing acini at the very end - some bubbly looking things and milk making things[^9]
	- Pregnant: expanded, well developed lobules and acini - bubbly look to it all.[^9]
		- Mammogram during pregnancy - bubbly looking, more purple as more and more acini[^9]
	- Older mammogram = more shrinkage, more fatty replacement, not as bright[^9]
- Benign hyperplasia[^9] Morphology - looks normal benign, less lobular acini, has all the normal structures though.[^9]
- Hyperplasia, carcinoma in situs, carcinomas = fibrocystic changes[^9]
- Stromal lesions - from intralobular regions typically[^9]
- Sarcomas = typically interlobular[^9]
- Pain = usually benign[^9]
- Methods - Mammogram and then do an xray + tomography - multiple stacked xrays[^9] - Least common imaging modality is MRI , most useful after already been dx with cancer.[^9]
- Mass lesions, usually found in ultrasound - speculated v smooth bordered (good); changes over time too + size[^9]
- Calcifications - can be pleomorphic, linear, changes over time[^9]
	- Nonproliferative fibrocystic change = epithelial + benign but various risks like with cysts[^9]
	- Proliferative fibrocystic change- increase in epithelium or myoepithelium[^9]
	- Atypical fibrocystic change- on their way to being cancer. = atypical duct hyperplasia + lobular hyperplasia[^9]
- Inflammatory processes - mastitis - most common is infection in breastfeeding women, S. aureus most common[^9]
- Diabetic mastopathy + sarcoidosis = autoimmune condition[^9]
- Foreign body rxns - like silicon granulomas getting some clear bubbles of silicone inside it surrounded by giant cells in ppl with implants. similar to fat necrosis - trauma to it = release of fats[^9]
	- Stroma lesions - 2 classes: the fibroademona + phyllodes tumor[^9]
	- Shared driver mutations = they're different but come from same mutations[^9]
	- Fibroadenoma - most common tumor, well circumscribed, young women but found in all ages.[^9]
		- Hyalinized stroma, ducts, no grapes. nodular appearance.[^9]
	- Phyllodes tumor - leaflike - can have more recurrence + more malignance = treat with excision.[^9]
		- Benign - well circumscribed few mitoses[^9]
		- Border line = inc mitoses, more cellularity + recurrence[^9]
		- Malignant - stromal overgrowth, atypical = risk is metastasis .[^9]
- Non proliferative fibrocystic change = no risk ; no epithelial hyperplasia, a single layer, just some cysts, fibrosis, adenosis (problem with glandular tissue) = BLUE domed cysts look blue! or palpable adenosis[^9]
	- Proliferative = 1.5-2x the relative risk for future cancer ; epithelial or myoepithelial hyperplasia[^9]
	- Most common - usual duct hyperplasia = where the duct space is filled with epithelium[^9]
	- Sclerosing adenosis. - architectural disturbance in tubal structure but increase epithelium there[^9]
	- Papillary lesions/papilloma - increase of *epithelium* inside the lumen.[^9]
	- Atypical = 4-5 times the relative risk of future cancer. can be atypical duct or lobular hyperplasia[^9]
		- Increased epithelium inside the lumen, but also trying to make ducts within that growth in the lumen.[^9]
		- Cribriform spaces, epithelium trying to make ducts inside the epithelium[^9]
- More of e-receptor positive cancers as we age; but ER poz cancers also tend to recur. [^9]  Young women - more likely to get triple negative cancer.[^9] Older women antiparallel or perpendicular to the skin, spiculated, posterior shadowing on US.[^9]
- Live birth less than 20 yrs of age, (young mother) you decrease your risk of getting breast cancer by half.[^9] Breast feeding = protective.[^9]
- First degree relative = germline mutation = much increased risk of cancer.[^9]
- Ionizing radiation - like hodgkin lymphoma as kid treatment raises risk[^9]
- Malignant cancers are clinically divided by biomarker profile, like ER = estrogen receptor driven , or Her2 prooncogene , or cancers that produce NO receptors = triple negative, no estrogen r, no prog r, and no her2.[^9]
	- In literature, they split into luminal A, b, basal-like, her2.[^9]
	- Luminal A = least aggro, usually ER poz ; Er positive, her2 negative, 50-65% of all tumors[^9]
		- PI3K + BRCA2 mutations lower grade.[^9]
	- Luminal b = a bit more aggro, usually ER poz, sometiemes prog neg,[^9]
		- TP53 altered, higher grade.[^9]
	- Basal-like = usually trip neg ; all negative. 10-20% of tumors[^9]
		- BRCA1, TP53 mutations, high grade[^9]
	- Her2 tumors; ER poz or neg. 10-20% of tumors[^9]
		- Erb2 or her2 altered, intermediate to high grade.[^9]
	- Morphology - noninvasive are ductal and lobular usually, usually confined and held by myoepithelial cells[^9]
	- DCIS = ductal carcinoma in situ - associated with necrosis and calcifications! linear ducts[^9]
		- Cribriform, solid papillary , can be low-high grade (usually more atypical, central necrosis), **great prognosis**[^9]
		- Paget's dz of nipple - extension of DCIS up to the lactiferous sinuses to nipples[^9]
- LCIS - lobular carcinoma in situ - _uniform cells with bland round nuclei, incidentally found, fully expanded the unit, unlike atypical lobular hyperplasia, which doesnt fill the whole thing_[^9]
	- Risk rises bilaterally, LCIS develop invasive cancers 2/3 on the same side. treat w/ anti-estrogens[^9]
- Nottingham combined histo grade = higher it is for invasive cancers (all ductal vs lobular) = more poorly differentiated it is = loss of normal tissue.[^9]
- Invasive lobular carcinoma - **single celled single file** infiltration thru the stroma[^9]
	- Cells lost e-cadherin, so basically they squeeze themselves thru the fibrosis as single cells[^9]
	- Unique metastases - CSF, brain metastases, bone marrow, GI ovary[^9]
	- ALWAYS ER poz, her2 neg.[^9]
- Invasive ductal carcinoma[^9]
	- Most common type of breast cancer[^9]
	- Ranges more well-poorly diff. prognosis base on size, stage, biomarker [^9]
	- Yellow fat, tan pink fleshy looking[^9]
- Tubular carcinoma - little acini glands that are spread out, small irregular mass ; ER poz, her2 neg, **good prognosis**[^9]
- Mucinious carcinomas - blueish - ER poz, her2 neg, **better prognosis**[^9]
- Medullary carcinoma - **poorly diff trip neg breast cancer**, intense lymphocytic infiltrate of t cells, better prog than other trip negative breast cancers. brca1 mutation carriers[^9]
- Metaplastic carcinomas **- poorly diff, often trip negative -** these have **squamous** features!!! unlike all the others which are adenocarcinomas. we have cartilage, poor response to chemo ):[^9]
- Inflammatory carcinomas - presentation of invasive carcinoma - we see lymphatic clogging = **orange peel skin** of the breast+floating tumors very poor prognosis![^9]
- Angiosarcoma - most common sarcoma - interlobular things, outside epithelium; **CD31 radiation staining seen[^9]**
	- Secondary to radiation treatment, can be primary in younger women, but most commonly 10 years post radiation in older women.[^9]
	- Bruising purple rash ont the surface[^9]
	- Little blue wisps = endothelial cells = more of the vascular lining stuff.[^9]
- BRCA 1 + BRCA 2 = both suppressors - so we require loss of heterozygosity - mutation of both alleles[^9]
	- BRCA1 = triple negative[^9]
	- BRCA2 = ER poz[^9]
- Tumor stage - pathologic stage - CAP = phase on pathologic findings.[^9]
- Clinical stage - tumor stage + whether there's any sort of metastases .[^9]
- Pattern of metastases dependent on biologic type:[^9]
	- TNBC, Her2 positive: brain and viscera[^9] - Her2 antibodies - trastuzumab, pertuzumab.[^9]
	- ER positive: bone[^9] - ER poz treat with - some blocking er, tamxifen, etc.[^9]

## Highlights for -SFP Pregnancy and Plancenta_Butler
- Spontaneous abortion = preg loss before 20 weeks, accounts for about 10-25% pregnancy loss[^10]
	- Threatened – uterine bleeding without cervical dilatation[^10]
	- Inevitable – uterine bleeding with cervical dilatation or effacement[^10]
	- Some maternal causes of spontaneous abortion- structural abnormalities of uterus, uncontrolled diabetes/htn, infection[^10]
	- Reasons for examining spontaneous abortions - rule out ectopics, id suspected abnormalities rule out gestational trophoblastic dz like big villi with hydropic change = risk for carcinoma[^10]
- RF for ectopic - scarring , prior PID and other causes like age 40+ and smoking[^10]
- Placenta previa – location of placenta over internal cervical os (normal implantation site is upper wall of uterus!), low lying, common with older, multipariety, male infants[^10]
- Vasa previa - location of fetal vessels are over the cervical os, where they cross over to the umbilical of baby, a good probability of rupture. do NOT do a vaginal exam, might need C section[^10]
	- Velamentous cord insertion - where we overly the cervix, unprotected by umbilical cord the vessels at risk of rupture... the umbilical cord is inserted in the fetal membranes[^10]
	- Bilobed placental discs - 2 equally sized placental lobes, with the chorionic vessels not protected and inserted into the fetal membranes and able to rupture.[^10]
- Placenta accreta spectrum - placenta impacts past decidua into myometrium, and then placenta gets abnormally adherent and cannot deliver normally in areas of accreta... problem postpartum lifethreatening bleeding bc placenta inside smooth muscle, hysterectomy[^10]
	- Further into myometrium - increta, no decidua, just the chorionic villi inserting into the smooth muscle / myometrium[^10]
	- Percreta - past the myometrium[^10]
- ACUTE amniotic fluid infections from ascending vaginal bacterial... GBS colonization = fetal infection. prophylaxis with antibiotics can reduce this[^10]
- Chronic -> TORCH infections or unknown etiology, going transplacentally are toxo, syphilis, cmv,, parvo and HSV.[^10]
- Plasma cells = CMV = viral thing , hemosiderin depots seen bc we are attacking these endothelial cells - brown pigment + classic owl eye nuclear inclusions[^10]
- Syphilis - hematogenous spread = yellow infiltrate from mom to fetus. we see spirochetes[^10]
	- Maternal inflammatory response -> neutrophils marginate to the amnion to fight infection, basically, going to that surface.[^10]
	- Fetal response - we have neutrophils going from umbilical + chorionic vessels to amnion to fight infection - so much cells that are spreading.[^10]
- Chronic villitis of unknown etiology - VUE most common - thought to be like transplant rejection of paternal + fetal antigens = so the mom antibodies will reject the placenta + destroy the chorionic villi.[^10]
- Malperfusion - from either mom or fetus perfusing the placenta - fetal/maternal vascular malperfusion; can be flow obstruction on fetal side or spiral artery remodding with preclampsia on the moms... caused by ANY TRIAD OF THROMBOSIS[^10]
	- Hypercoiled umbilical cord = deep invaginations between each one will make the flow veryyyy much more static = more thrombosis[^10]
	- A problem with mom to placenta due to some error with spiral artery remodding - so we have the low capacitance high pressure system - where blood quickly shoots out and hits only one area.[^10]
	- From abnormal/shallow placentation, where host fails to provide differentiation signals for extravillous trophoblasts -> they don't remod them[^10]
	- Placental injury oxidative stress -> anti angiogenic mediators released, causing systemic preelampsia + proteinuria[^10]
- Placental hypoplasia <10% of gestational weight, severe growth restriction ->[^10]
- Decidual arteriopathy - pathology in decidual arteries (like htn causing depo of fibros and stuff), *foamy macrophages* fill the cell[^10]
- Accelerated villous maturation - when we are hypoxic, we increase more and more terminal villi to exchange.[^10]
- Villous infarction - we get some areas of coagulative necrosis then thrombus in hematomas[^10]
- Preclampsia - triad: hypertension, proteinuria, edema, 140/90+ after 20 wks, proteinuria 300+, and common in first pregnancy primiparas, twin, obesity, 35+ , dm, htn, kidney dz[^10]
- HELLP syndrome = we need to deliver placenta and induce labor[^10]
	- Hemolysis[^10]
	- Elevated liver test[^10]
	- Low platelets[^10]
- Placental abruption - premature separation of placenta from uterine call[^10]
	- Concealed = confined to uterine cavity vs revealed where blood goes to cervix.[^10]
- Monozygotic twins - identical - we can have them dichorionic or diamniotic too[^10]
	- Morula cleavage. - dichorionic diamniotic - 2 amions, 2 chorions[^10]
	- Blastocyst cleavage = monochorionic diamnionic - 2 ammions same placenta though[^10]
	- IMPLANTED Blastocyst cleavage - monochorionic monoamnionic = cord entanglement can happen w/ monochorionic pregnancies, can get twin twin transfusion between them[^10]
	- Cleavage in formed embryonic disk - conjoined twins -[^10]
- Hydatidiform moles - cystic swelling of villi , variable trophoblastic prolif[^10]
	- Complete mole = without fetal embryonic tissue; but risk of persistent trophoblastic dz... + future choriocarcinoma... increase in b-hcg[^10]
	- !!!complete mole is diploid with paternal DNA[^10]
	- Partial = with some fetal/embryonic tissue; no significant risk of future trophoblastic dz/choriocarcinoma[^10]
	- These are TRIPLoid with 2 sets of dad's chromosomes + 1 set of moms'.[^10]
- Choriocarcinoma - malignant - usually follows complete mole, pregnancies/miscarriages - gestational tumor , high cure rate to chemo![^10]
