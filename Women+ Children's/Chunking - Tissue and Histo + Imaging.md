note - annual mammography + clinical breast exam @ 40 yo for asymptomatic women 
20s+30s every 3 yrs Clinical breast exam
dark areas = fat
- fatty replaced breasts - you lack that white tissue, happens as you age - easier too read
fibroglandular tissue = whiteness = will see more with dense breast tissue + heterogenous looking. 
pleomorphic calcifications - we see bright white dots, all look different. or segmenting shapes for it too. 
rounded masses - look like big ol cysts, but if a new mass is growing = cancer 
architectural distortion - pulls tissue around, looks slightly like pleomorphic calcifications = looks like a scar. but look into high risk lesions. 
- can look like increased density = a red flag 
dilated ducts - radiatiosn coming from the nipple. not look good - looks like fluid debries. 
asymetric density - not good unless it's been there for years. 
lymph node imaging - do with an ultrasound 
breast edema - entire whited out tissue, pushed off? - thinking of obstructive illnesses, heart failure, swelling, renal 
mammographically occult = heterogenous, bordderline. may or may not see a mass. then we ultrasound or mri supplemental screening 
intramammary lymph nodes - axillary lymph nodes, looks like, but looks if hypoechoic, reniform, fatty hilum 
cyst - well circumscribed borders. 
disease extent determined by mammmo + US - within a cm of the obvious mass? - might have to biopsy to make sure its not 2 cancers different. 
gyno - hypoechoic flame like structures from chest wall from nippl 
textbook - l or r breast is lighting up - always a breast cancer on CT. 
nipple discharge - mri - papillomas can happen behind the nipple 

## Highlights for -SFP Breast Anatomy and Histology_Hazen-Martin
- Mammary gland - exocrine gland - gland that develops from an epithelal downgrowth into the mesenchyme[^21]
- Fully mature female breast - a compound tubuloacinar gland[^21]
- Compound - branching duct system[^21]
- Secretory structures are tubules capped with acini.[^21]
- Embryo to birth - dev of ducts + nipple - we should b able to locate the mammary gland by birth[^21]
- Puberty. - ducts elongate + branch further - type of hormones[^21]
- Circulating T -> regression fo breasts[^21]
- Estrogen - terminal end ducts develop!; but the pregnancy + childbirth will cause secretory[^21]
- Embryo 4-6 wks - mammary line develops by 4 wk, from axilla to the groin bilaterally - thickening of ectoderm + interaction with the mesoderm below.[^21]
- Humans only in pectoral region preferentially due to temporal expression.[^21]
- Somites - secrete fibroblast growth factor FGF, activates overlying ectoderm to express WNT -> causes ectodermal thickening in milk line + ectodermal thickening placode bud.[^21]
- Placode signals adjacent mesenchyme makes thiceknings which support ductal growth -> nipple[^21]
- In women - polymastia - we can notice aberrant breast tissue which enlarges during pregnancy[^21]
- Polythelia often seen in young men - discoloration similar to nipple color.[^21]
- Ectoderm with WNT -> WNT will induce changes in the underlying mesenchyme, which will make rings around the breast bud.[^21]
- Ectoderm makes cord that will drive thru those rings and then eventually make the ductal tree[^21]
- Baisally ectoderm + concentric rings -> make the nippl externally[^21]
- 9 wks - concentric ring makes nipple basically - but this time we have a deression or a mammary pit[^21]
- First trimester - each cord makes a lactiferous duct which makes a whole lobe of the breast[^21]
- You only have as many lobes as there are lactiferous ducts.[^21]
- 2nd trimester - lactiferous duct gives rise to lobular branches[^21]
- Birth - all the lactiferus ducts empty onto there, all breast tissue fits under or beneath areola.[^21]
- We don't know for sure... but breast has about 9-10 main lactiferous ducts; therefore only 9-10 lobes[^21]
- Ppl say lactiferous duct makes a dilated sinus before it opens on nipple - but there's no such thing as it![^21]
- Structure of a lobe - think that all that interlobar dense CT thickens around each lobe[^21]
- There's fat between each lobe randomly - size of a female breast is dictated by how much fat there is, not how many lobes[^21]
- Intralobular ducts + tubulosecretory units surrounding it, we call that TDLUs - terminal ductulee lobular unit[^21]
- ![[TDLU histoo breast.png]][^21]
- Oxytocin -> causes contraction of myoepithelial cells -> causes the milk to go to nipple - expulsion of milk[^21]
- Secretory cells - make protein called casein. and also lipid vacuoles secreted - as apical membrane buds offf -[^21]
- Secretion for it. - when you stop breastfeeding - casein goes down -> then you have some metalloproteinase will rise again, instrumental in remodding collagen!!![^21]
- Suspensory ligaments in keeping nipple close to 4th intercostal. as we age, these become less efficient[^21]
- Medial breast will drain to parasternal nodes[^21]
- Preferential route for the cancer - in axillary nodes[^21]

## Highlights for -SFP Anatomy and Histology of Placenta_Butler
- Day 5-7[^22]
- Adhesion of blastocyst into the lining, we will have some differentiation the outer cell mass or trophoblast into[^22] primary chorionic villi 
	- Inner cytotrophoblast - primitive mononuc cells, germinal cells for syncytium to be stem cells[^22]
	- Outer syncytiotrophoblast = no individual cells, no cell borders but multinuc giant cells, invasive capable of going into uterine epithelium + endocrine organ like HCG[^22]
		- This will invade into the endometrium[^22]
		- Eventually makes lacunae that eventually become intervillous space[^22]
		- Then we get pillars and radial growth of the syncytiotrophoblast invading.[^22]
- Secondary chorionic villi - with extraembryonic mesoderm from chorionic cavity growing into trabeculae (originally they were from cytotrophoblast) -> connective tissue + bv in 2 weeks[^22]
- Tertiary/mesenchymal chorionic villi - fetal capillaries in 18-20 days[^22]
- Extraembryonic somatic mesoderm invasion becomes the chorionic plate, making that connecting stalk also the *umbilical cord* post invasion and formation of artery and vein.[^22]
	- Connects that fetal architecture with the decidua.[^22]
- Extravillous trohpoblasts base will b connecting mom and child[^22]
- Recall - the myometrial arteries -> arcuate -> straight and spiral arteries ; the embryo implants in the functionalis layer, with the spiral arteries[^22]
- How to connect the 2 circuits of fetal + maternal blood[^22]
	- Early 1/2nd trimester placenta - bulbous big and not much architecture + thick , essentially 4 layers. out to in = syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, mesenchyme, vascular endothelium of fetal capillary[^22]
	- Early pregnancy - try to set up the skeleton of the villi tree - so we set up ith trophoblastic sprouts of the villus, then the stem villi[^22]
![[tertiary immature intermed stem villi.png]]
- mature v mature villi[^22]
	- Immature - large bulbous, continuous, loos myxoid stroma, central capillaries w no membranes,[^22]
	- Mature = small mostly capillaries, noncontinuous layer w regression of cytotrophoblasts + mounding of syncytiotrophoblast, collagenized stroma, peripheral capillaries[^22]
- Umbilical cord - tan gray twisting and coils - 2 pair arteries from the deox blood to the placenta[^22]
	- Veins taking oxygenatec nutrients etc to the fetus[^22]
	- Lined by amniotic epithelium, composed of wharton's substance, lots of GAGs, macrophages, abundant water for flexibility![^22]
Extraplacental: 
- Amnion - layer closest to the aminionic fluid + fetus , cuboidal epithelium[^22]
- Chorion - layer of CT overlaying a basement membrane + extravillous trophoblasts[^22]
	- Decidua - composed of decidual stromal cells, a, v[^22]
	- Decidua basalis - has the spiral arteries at the base providing to the fetus?[^22]
	- Decidual capsularis - the capsule over the sac[^22]
	- Decidual parietalis - will make the capsularis and stuff fuse, making the decidua vera[^22]
