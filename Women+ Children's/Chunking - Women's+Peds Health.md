Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development 
• Sensorimotor (~Birth – 2 years) 
	egocentric - cannot perceive world from others - **cognitive goal: obj permanence!**
• Preoperational Stage (~2 – 6/7 years) 
	interact w world thru language, imagery, still egocentric
	animism + pretend play 
	**cognitive goal of using symbols in thinking**
• Concrete Operational Stage (~7 – 12 years) 
	converse + think logically - and also understand reversibility 
	classification - can group things 
	**cognitive goal: logical thinking**
• Former Operational Stage (~12+)
	develop ideas in abstract world without physical constraints
	tackle moral philosophical and moral issues. 
![[Erikson's Stages.png]]
infancy - basic trust v basic mistrust... 0-1 yrs hope is their trait 
- also oral stage 
early childhood = 1-4 yo, exploring on own autonomy v shame , getting their own will. 
	also anal stage
play age = 3-5 yo , getting a sense of purpose in life. intiative v guilt with social interactions 
	phallic stage - develop the superego + oedipus complex 
school age is 5-6-11 yo ... getting more competence. ; industry v inferiority with academics 
	latency - libido suppressed, acting on focusing on sports etc. 
	sublimation - replace unhealthy impulse with productive alternative 

## Highlights for -FPC Parental Anticipatory Guidance Ritchie
Infancy[^3]
- Food ramp up solid foods between 6-12 months - well check in 2-4 month well checks to anticipate ramping up solids[^3]
- Screentime <18 months NONE other than video chatting[^3]
- Sleep 12-16 hrs including nap[^3]
- Rear facing car seat as LoNG as possible[^3]
- Screening: • Caregiver depression • Social determinants of health[^3]
- At all ages - as soon as we have teeth , between 6-10 months, we need to brush[^3]

Toddlers = 1-3 yrs[^3]
- 15,18,30,36 months all well checks offered[^3]
- Toddlers need actually less food bc they don't grow as fast! they can become picky/erratic eaters! Just offer a selection! encourage sitting while eating/chewing[^3]
- Limit screens less than 1 hr "quality programming" like pbs kids, slow moving and stuff; avoid screen in bedroom[^3]
- Sleep 11-14 hours including naps[^3]
- Keep a 5 point harness with the car seats.[^3]
- Read daily, work on naming obj/body parts, ask about the pictures too to work on sounds, colors, etc.[^3]
- Allow *independence* w dressing/feeding; reward wanted behaviors MORE. use *brief timeouts from 1-3 yrs, no need for logical explanations*[^3]
	- Toilet training - exhibit readiness anytime from 18 mon - 3 yo[^3]
	- At 18 months, they take off diaper on own - showing readiness first[^3]
	- 2.5 - 3 years of age most children are developmentally ready ; terrible 2s are when they don't necessarily wanna cooperate[^3]
- Low income households - "tell me what type of home you live in" - like housing built before *1978* ... "and do you know when it was built?"[^3]
	- **Even low levels of lead - *teardrop cells, basophilic stippling = all lead poisoning*[^3]**
	- Tested at 12 + 24 months = test EVERYBODY[^3]
Preschoolers = 3-5 yr[^3]
- Eat food together, lim salt + sodium[^3]
- Acitvity - free play balls[^3]
- Sleep = 10-13 hrs, naps might get phased out[^3]
- Safety - care in playing in streets - tricycle helmets, watch kid all times, be safe in water *teach to swim*, teach stranger safety + reporting, keep kid in forward facing car seat with harness until the limit. when they outgrow, get them a booster seat[^3]
- Encourage play with others, continue to read go to lib, avoid baby talk, correct words and phrases as needed, clear discipline.[^3]
	- Time outs, 1 minute per year of age[^3]
	- Natural consequences - not wearing gloves on cold day = having cold hands. teasing other kids = being avoided by them.[^3]
	- Logical consequences - leaving bike out = put up bike. refusing to brush teeth = no more sweets until regular brushing. no eating dinner = no dessert[^3]
	- Poz reinforcement - star chart[^3]
- They have dental visit at 1 year of age regardless of whether they have teeth![^3]
- Starting at 4 months talk oral health at every visit[^3]
- Recommendations under 3 yo = rice size smear toothpaste[^3]
- And 3+ age = a pea side of toothpaste.[^3]
Middle childhood 6-11[^3]
- Goal of: 1 hr+ physical activity each day. @ school, they only get 20 min at max of activity[^3]
- Mix aerobic, muscle + bone stregthening, be a role model[^3]
- Screen time = 2 hrs per day of quality programming(not inclusive of at school). develop a media use plan for family[^3]
- Start talking about puberty at 6 yo... bc on early side girls go thru it at 8 and boys at 9[^3]
- Tanner stages = tanner stage 1 = we have not started puberty. and its a stage from 1-5.[^3]

## Highlights for -FPC Child Adolescent Mistreatment_Roten
- CAPTA - passed id min set of acts + behaviors on a state level to define child abuse[^4]
	- "Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation” OR • "An act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm."[^4]
	- Abuse/neglect - done or not done by parent, caregiver, or individual in a custodial role (i.e. babysitter, coach, teacher) - note - it doesn't matter the intent[^4]
	- *assault* - refers to actions performed by non-caregivers[^4]
		- If you hit them to punish but don't mean to cause injury - could still be considered physical abuse.[^4]
	- Physical, sexual, . attempt @ sexual contact is also seen as sexual abuse[^4]
	- Emotional maltreatment - persistent or extremely thwarts a child's basic emotional needs.[^4]
- Physical consequences - stress response, cortisol + neuroanatomy - decreased hippocampal size in adults suffering from abuse[^4]
- Treatment should focus on: (make sure the kid is safe first)[^4]
	- Protection / safety of the child[^4]
	- Strengthening family relationships[^4]
	- Understanding the impact of trauma on the child - what is bothering the kid the most? completely individual based on the kid.[^4]
	- Well-being of child (treatment of psychiatric symptoms, functional impairment); disrupted sleep + nightmares. make sure they're not to blame/not responsible for the trauma[^4]
- Https://dss.sc.gov - we need to call for abuse and explain it - for suspected case etc. - now we have a central intake system, one phone number for everyone in SC.[^4]
	- We don't need to have conclusive proof. we don't ave to be certain - reasonable suspicion[^4]
	- Realistically, we can always report to law enforcement. never wrong to; dss would ideally cross report w/ law enforcement too when you reach out.[^4]
	- Also it's helpful to notify everybody in the household like the parental figures beforehand.[^4]
	- We must be there to report - cannot delegate it to any assistant or something[^4]
- Will have to report for other people's kids too[^4]
- -kid doesn't have to be your patient. if you see a parent as a patient, you can still report.[^4]
- You will call law enforcement if the perpetrator isn't the kid's guardian or caregiver at all![^4]

Mature minor - state laws, at 16 - that allow pt consent for care without parental consent.[^5]
- Younger ages are allowed as deemed necessary by the provider - like if they're 14, having sex, they'll screen for STIs and then test for poz, we can treat them and then don't have to tell parents[^5]
- Birth control - if 14 and starting BC, we need to tell parents. "let me talk to your parents abt this. if not about sex, we can find another reason, like heavy periods or something"[^5]
Tanner staging - 2 things on step one - but keep this in mind key findings - start this convo at age 7[^5]
	Stage 4 = - nipple + areola will project to make a 2nd mound on the test - clinically easy to identify .[^5]
	Pubic hair growth - stage 3 - darker coarser + more CURLED hair. NO hair on thigh areas. same for males.[^5]
- Screen 
	- htn annually , obesity + ED, vision, hearing, anemia, TB, dyslipidemia[^5]
	- Htn - bp - male/female, height and age gives you a percentile. weight is not a part of the formula[^5]
	- STIs if sexually active. some do point of care hiv blood draw etc.[^5]
	- Anemia in mensturating females - end of puberty in them.[^5]
	- Pregnancy[^5]
	- Substance abuse/alc[^5]
- Impairment distinguishes abnormal behavior- how does behavior affect ability to accomplish tasks + avoid injury/other legal/med/social consequences[^5]
- 3 leading causes of adolescent morbidity + mortailty[^5]
	- Intentional injuries[^5]
	- Unintentional injuries like accidents[^5]
	- Unintended pregnancy, STIs[^5]

## Highlights for -HRR Maternal CV TBL
- Minute respiration volume with pregnancy, minute vol increases, increasing pao2, reducing paco2, making alkalosis , and kidney compensatin, plasma hco3- lower.[^10]
	- ==remember 4,1, 3,2==
	==7.44 pH== 
	==104 pO2 higher than 95 normal== 
	==30 pCO lower than 40 normal== 
	==20 HCO3 lower than normal== 
- More co2 blown off to facilitate o2/co2 fetal transfer -[^10]
- Tidal volume goes up by 200 ml[^10]
- Cardio - peripheral vasodilation, more CO, more SV and bounding/collapsing pulse.[^10]
	- Hematologically more plasma volume, less platelets, more wbc, and more *fibrinogen+factpr 8.* more hypercoagulatility[^10]
	- Progesterone is the biggest effector. hcg will spike early and then go down later, but the prog will be produced early in the corpus luteum and then placenta takes over in 2nd trimester[^10]
- Length of blood vessel * viscosity / radius[^10]
	- Radius is inversely proportional to the resistance by a power of 4... more the radius = less resistance.[^10]
- R = pressure gradient / Q flow[^10]
- SVR = mean arterial pressure - resisting flw pressure is the right atrium pressure/CO * 80 dynes s cm^-5[^10]
	- But in either of these just drop that 80 given in Wood Units.[^10]
- SVR = MAP/CO * 80[^10]
- All our systems are in paralell bc of low resistance[^10]
- Uterine flow = 2-4% of CO in a NONpregnant state[^10]
	- Later it will increase to 15-20% of CO!!! a huge increase! 1/5 of the blood flow. isgoing into. theuterus. so then we can see in US if there's a difference in the blood flow, if there's occlusions more risk of ecclampsia[^10]
	- The maternal blood goes in via spiral arteries.[^10]
- Blood volume will increase, dramatically[^10]
- But plasma vol does faster.[^10]
	- Now because the total blood volume is bigger, and the plasma is, the RBC doesn't increase as much - we get physiolgical anemia - lower resistance to flow, increased volume that protects against blood loss @ childbirth[^10]
- CO in general goes up during pregnancy - laying on the left lateral = more CO[^10]
	- If you lay flat on ur back CO decreases due to the positions of the growing uterus and the vena cava returns - we often rec them to do left lateral - to decrease vena cava compression[^10]
- CO = SV * HR ; volume ejected from heart per min, SV = vol from ventricle per beat.[^10]
- CO = MAP/SVR[^10]
- CO = VO2 oxygen consumption / (CaO2 what blood picks up from lungs -CvO2 venous o2,[^10]
- CO during pregnancy - SV increases in 1st trimester then plateaus, but remains elevated[^10]
	- HR steadily increases then plateaus in the end .[^10]
	- BP during pregnancy - we see normal values... in systemic ones. but a huge drop in diastolic pressure, meaning the smaller resistance.[^10]
- Prog - vascular smooth muscle cells + nuclear receptors[^10]
	- Reduction of cytosolic Ca, which promotes SM relaxation + remodding blood vessels[^10]
	- Add more BV + desensitizes ang2 receptors (these will be increasing Ang-1-7 , which is an ACE enzyme, a vasodilatory peptide vs Ang2 which is a vasoconstrictory)[^10]
	- So we have normal BP in spite of increasing Ang2...[^10]
		- But in preeclampsia we have less Ang2 + Ang1-7 and less progesterone!!! so the Ang2 receptors are not desensitized is in normal pregnancies.[^10]
- Never forget - thyroid disease can get worse and into thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy - some thyroid disorders specifically due to pregnancy and get them into SVT.[^10]
- PMI different! also some compression of venous return to heart + lower extremity edema.[^10]
	- Left ventricular mass increases by a lot during pregnancy - neither eccentric nor concentric[^10]
	- Ejection fraction will increase early on in pregnancy and then decrease with plateau[^10]
	- On the frank starling curve, we mainly just see an increase in preload / stretch = increase in dimensions is an increase of preload => huge change in increase in stroke volume[^10]
	- Increase in contractility therefore stroke volume[^10]
	- Strength of murmurs will increase due to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy + MV prolapse[^10]
- Peri/postpartum cardiomyopathy - more bc we're better at diagnosing it? more risk factors now.[^10]
	- New onset heart failure between the last month of pregnancy and 5 months post delivery with no determinable cause[^10]
	- High output heart failure - where your heart can still pump normally initially either ith reduced or Preserved EF, but body increasing need for blood.[^10]
	- Basically CO is higher.[^10]
	- Recurrence goes up with more pregnancies ): those that do recover have rrisk still but not as significant.[^10]
- FRC functional residual capacity and inspiratory capacity make up your TLC.[^10]
	- Bc of increase in diaphragm, your FRC and specifically your expiratory reserve volumes will decrease a bit!!![^10]
	- Overall tidal volume changes significantly bc of extra... so you have the minute respiration will change.[^10]
	- Minute vol increases PaO2, reduces PaCO2. (baby offloads, so we need to decrease more of that in the mom to make their waste flow to her easier)[^10]
- ***Kidneys of mom compensate with secreting more bicarb - mild respiratory alkalosis[^10]***
	- In the case of acidotic state like diabetic ketoacidosis etc... note pregnant moms more likely to become acidotic when sick.[^10]
- Pulm vascular resistance - decrease in this![^10]
- Dilating the pulmonary vessels, more blood flow thru lungs they can get rid of more CO2 and pick up more o2.[^10]

![[prenatal visit info freq.png]]
	- Before the 3rd trimester which is like about 28 weeks pts come once a month[^11]
	- Then it's every 2 weeks[^11]
	- Then it's basically every week for the last month.[^11]
- First prenatal visits - pregnancy dating // earlier the pregnancy the more accurate[^11]
	- Last menstrual period calculation only useful if they got regular cycles of 28 days.[^11]
	- EDD - estimated date of delivery - best dating is an accurate last menstrual period with a first trimester ultrasound.[^11]
- First thing - blood counts, antibody screenings, STIs, HIv, immunity to stufff, etc[^11]
- Carrier screening - basic carrier stuff for EVERYONE[^11]
	- Hemoglobinopathy like thalassemias, sickle cells, CF, spinal muscular atrophy[^11]
- Special populations - like family hx of fragile x or intellectual disability we screen. also premature ovarian failure[^11]
	- Ashkenazi jewish - canavan dz, CF, dysautonomia, tay sachs[^11]
- Aneuploidy - cell-free fetal DNA - noninvasive, this is what we do now called NIPS/NIPT[^11] ; [[-HRR Genetic Testing I+II_Bulmer]] 
	- Most commonly checking aneuploidy for placental SNPs in maternal circulation.[^11]
	- Indicates at risk, not diagnostic bc it's just a screen.[^11]
	- Amniostesis - amniotic fluid tap to get an actual diagnostic test.[^11]
- leading cause now for maternal mortality is - maternal mental illness and substance use[^11]
- ACOG strategy - QI focus initiative, see postpartum 1-3 wks instead of 6 wks. , mental health resources and establishment of PCP for up to a year postpartum.[^11]

## Highlights for -FPC Labor and Delivery_Alkis
- Term 37 wk, preterm 20-37, abortions <20 wks living[^12]
- G# Para - TPAL - term, preterm, abortions, living.[^12]
- Fetal heart rate tracings - we need to know these.[^12]
	- Top part - the baby , measured with doppler.[^12]
	- Big lines = 1 minute. small boxes = 6 seconds.[^12]
	- Y axis - the heart rate.[^12]
	- Bottom part - the contractions on the mom , external and internal monitors.[^12]
	- Baseline rate - the baby tends to stay near this number on the y axis - this is the baseline?[^12]
	- Baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) variability - degree of fluctuation above or below the baseline... note that this is over time bc the fetus has to sleep too which impacts it.[^12]
		- We want moderate variability the most - to make sure we dont have an acidotic baby! best indicator! squiggly line;[^12]
		- Minimal variability - like l*ess than 5 beats* variation around baseline. barbituates/prematurity/[^12]
		- Absent variability - like a flat line[^12]
		- Marked variability - super rare, super squiggly, not good nor bad but needs more information.[^12]
	- Presence of accelerations- increase above baseline and come back down - visually apparent, abrupt peak from baseline - sign of good healthy babies.[^12]
		- <32 weeks, expect 10 bpm , one box above the baseline for 10 seconds.[^12]
		- 32+ weeks, 15 bpm above the baseline. for like 15 seconds[^12]
	- Periodic or episodic decelerations - VEAL CHOPS - look at the onset of the decelertion, how long it takes to hit the nadir/valley, and then the recovery to baseline.[^12]
		- Variable - Cord compression, looks like a V! where the onset to nadir is less than 30 s, then recovery. or water broken early[^12]
		- Early - *good*, from head compression and labor, onset starts before the peak of the contraction.[^12]
		- Prolonged - very bad; emergency C section - looks like a plane crash - hr down to 60s and 80s, baseline basically completely crashed for a long time. greater than 2 min, less than 10 min[^12]
		- Late - bad - *placental insufficiency* - this is like a *more gradual bad change*. - will be starting aftr the peak of contraction .[^12]
- Three tiered FHR system for being in labor.[^12]
	- Cat 1 is okay[^12]
	- Baseline rate 110-160 beats per min[^12]
	- Variability moderate[^12]
	- No late/variable decel,[^12]
	- Early decelerations can be here or not.[^12]
- Cat 3 - very srs, absent baseline FHR variability[^12]
	- Recurrent late decel, variable decel, bradycardia[^12]
	- Sinusoidal curves? = fetal anemia, very strong! 3-6 cycles in 1 minute[^12]
- Stages of labor[^12]
	- First stage onset of labor to complete dilation 10. cm[^12]
		- 6 cm dilated or more = active phase rapid cervical change[^12]
		- Only prolonged if it's 20+ hrs.[^12]
		- 3 components to cervical exam? dilation, 2 fingers to feel how thick or thin it is = effacement. and station = head to the ischial spine of the mom.[^12]
		- Effacement - feel length of the cervix on your fingers. lng = 0% effaced, then 50% is like 2 cm . very thin below that, so they've been laboring for a while.[^12]
		- Fetal station[^12]
			- 0 = plane of ischial spines[^12]
			- +3,2,1 are good, pushing it out.[^12]
		- Occiput/back of head anterior = anterior at the pubic symphisis[^12]
		- Occiput posterior - baby's looking up at the cieling. can deliver vaginally tho .[^12]
		- Rarer presentations - face presentations - we cannot get to their occiput bc they come out face first.[^12]
		- So mentum / chin anterior can deliver but mentum posterior can't...[^12]
		- **Protracted labor = 6 cm + and dilating less than 1 cm over 2 hrs. - we can make pitocin. and perform amniotomy - we also have oxytocin[^12]**
	- Arrest of dilation - rupture membranes, 6 hrs no cervical change with inadequate contractions and 4 hrs of no change with adequate contractions[^12]
- 2nd stage - complete dilation to fetal expulsion - passive phase - before mom is actively pushing. active phase - when mom pushes more[^12]
	- Nulliparous - allow new moms to push for 3 hours.[^12]
	- Multiparous - allow mothers to push for 2 hrs[^12]
	- Add one more hr for epidural[^12]
	- Begin pitocin if no descent in first 60-90 min of pushing[^12]
- 3rd stage - expulsion to placental expulsion - avg length 5-6 min, max is 30 min.[^12]
	- Cardinal movements.[^12]
	- Engagement • Descent • Flexion of head, under pubic bone• Internal rotation - angle of head tries to face up into ceiling to fit thru • Extension - under the pubic bone• External rotation - head turns for shoulders • Expulsion[^12]
 Ob triage pearls - 4 qs always ask[^12]
- Contractions- how ofen, how strong[^12]
- Vag bleeding - never normal in pregnancy[^12]
- Leakage of fluid[^12]
- Fetal movement- increased is not bad, but decreased is bad.[^12]
Common workups[^12]
- Preeclampsia CBC, CMP, urine protein/cr ratio[^12]
- Rupture rule out - pool , ferning, nitrazine paper, swabbing their vagina[^12]
- Preterm labor - cervical exam. what makes labor contractions different than normal ones is that cervix will dilate.[^12]

## Highlights for -FPC Contraception_Dempsey
- ![[moa overview contraceptives.png]]
- Progesterone - inhibits LH surge from pituitary gland, inhibiting ovulation and menstruation- primary contraceptive[^13]
	- Thickens mucus of cervix[^13]
	- Decreases cilia motility of fallopian tube[^13]
	- Endometrial atrophy[^13]
- Estrogen - inhibits FSH in turn suppressing follicle dev from the pituitary gland. - bleeding control will continue with the combined hormones, also more predictable[^13]
- Copper inc copper ion IUD -> spermicidal[^13]
- Levonogestrel IUD - will thicken cervical mucus, endometrial activity, about 50% users don't ovulate. hormonal iud users.[^13]
- Reasons to avoid hormones - CI to estrogen breast cancer, pt pref, medication interactions[^13]
- Long acting - copper iud + LNG IUD + implant[^13]
- Prescription - oral contra, patch, ring, injection (stop on your own, but prescription only)[^13]
- Self initiated - condoms, Opill (prog only) without prescription, etc.[^13]
	- Implant + IUD - most effective reversible methods + also permanent method too[^13]
- CI to estrogen therapies - risk of venous or arterial thromboembolism[^13]
	- Smokers 35+ breast cancer, migranes , severe htn. = more coagulation to be aware of with estrogen therapies[^13]
- Breastfeeding women can safely initiate prog only methods (postpartum women are hypercoagulable) + e after 42 days immediately.[^13]

## Highlights for -FPC Breast Exam_Keiser
- Visual inspection[^14] Seated position, lower + open drape to inspect both simultaneously[^14]
	- Hands at side, then raised hands (reveals dimpling) , then hands on hips (will stretch lateral tissue- dimpling/retraction in skin)[^14]
	- Leaning forward last motion - optional.[^14]
	- Asymmetry is very normal. new skin changes - lok into history - thickening, prominent pores, redness.[^14]
- Sudden nipple inversion - recall this is cancerous potentially .[^14]
	- Paget disease - rash/ulceration of nipple, indicates underlying ductal carcinoma. looks kinda like eczema around the nipple[^14]
- Best palpate lymphatics - just palpate lateral + supraclavicular ones[^14]
	- Support their arms, try to keep breasts covered, examine all 4 sides of axilla in a "diamond"[^14]
	- Deep in apex of axilla, hand straight up, deep into underarm[^14]
- Supine breast palpation - put arm up and over the head[^14]
	- Palpating technique - pads 2,3,4th flexed fingers. lawnmower go up and down.[^14]
	- Know her density and the consistency of tissue - if too dense, we can't feel it - might warrant sooner screening[^14]
	- Gently place thumb/index finger on medial + lateral sides of nipple or sandwich nipple between fingertips of both hands - good if there's no discharge complaint[^14]
	- Many abnormal findings - skin findings.[^14]
		- Dimpling, edema (lymphatic blockade, mass deep inside blocking lymph draining, peau d'orange), pagets dz. , nipple retraction[^14]
- Breast mass - super common - order diagnostic mammogram not screening one.[^14]
	- <30, targeted ultasound... we see something that's possibly benign. = 6 month follow up ultrasound.[^14]
		- Reason why we do ultrasound not mammogram - young ppl have dense breast tissue[^14]
	- 30+ -> diagnostic mammogram + ultrasound.... then if it's prob a benign , we see 6 month followup imaging .[^14]
		- If suspicious finding, we do image guided core needle biopsy for both[^14]
- Cyclical focal pain - no non-routine imagine if clinical breast exam normal ; coming with other PMS symptoms?[^14]
- Noncyclical focal pain - age under 30, ultrasound, and over 30 - diagnostic mammogram w/ ultrasound[^14]
- Physiologic discharge - non spontaneous bilateral, white yellow or green - no imaging needed[^14]
- Self-breast exam monthly - not required. but self awareness is recommended. notify if there's new lump, nipple discharge, redness or pain.[^14]

family planning 
---
1/4 women terminate pregnancy with induced women, and 10% of that is physiological purely 
55% of women - majority of ppl who induce abortions already have a family and they used contraception 
- mostly in first trimester , before 6 wks but 7-9 wks make up a huge chunk of it ); 
- later pregnancies are with serious malformations and stillbirths
- abortion rate historical low due to contraceptives
- half poverty women and other half affluent. 
placenta accreta - drastically increases maternal mortality ): key thing that could result in death but we can't abort. at 19 wks, death rises for baby etc. 
![[abortion methods.png]]
- d and c - curette - to scrape off the endometrium etc. 
- suction - similar to the MVA different tip ; 
- mvas - done in office, 
- medications - abortion pills in own home and naturally pass 
- induction - we give them pills in the hospital and make sure they actually empty their contents there since it's more attached
- dilation and evacuation - need to get all up in there and dilate the cervix more. 
- miscarriage procedure is the same. 

mifepristone - prog receptor antagonist - anti-progestin effects
- decidual necrosis, cervical softening, increased contractility, increased **prostaglandin** sensitivity*** this is the most important step!! as a **primer** . used in 1st and 2nd trimester
misoprostol - prostaglandin e1 analogue, now the receptors have max effects, uterine contractions. use in 1st and 2nd trimster, *higher serial doses in 2nd semester* - the **contraction** provider! 
- only good for like earlier gestational levels. 
mifepristone + misoprostol. 
- mifepristone 200 mg, 800 mcg misoprostol, and maybe even another dose of misoprostol 
risk of mental health problems no greater with first trimester abortion than carrying unplanned pregnancy to term
