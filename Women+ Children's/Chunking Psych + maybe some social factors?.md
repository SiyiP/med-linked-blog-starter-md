---
Common pediatric Illnesses + Peds Cases I+II -
case 1 - 2 days **fever**, 14 mos old, **fussiness**, **sleeping difficulty**, cold , **ear tugging**, congestion 
exam - ill but not toxin, making tears, <3 RRR lungs CTAB, abdomen soft.  left TM tympanic membrane is pearly gray and normal, but ==right TM bulging + erythematous with **dulled light reflex**; abnormal color is white, amber, etc.==
	**acute otitis media** - suppurative infection of middle ear, most likely bacterial 
		==**strep pneumonia**== 
		==**non-typeable h. influenzae (not covered by vaccine)**== 
		==**moraxella catarrhalis**==
		- typically 6-15 mos, seasonal, high peak late winter/early spring 
		- 10% recurrence in kids, 3+ episodes in 6 mos or 4+ in 12 months. 
			- immediate - antibiotic treatments under 6 mos of age ... 
			- but otherwise if 2+ yo, consider observation first, if they're just unilateral with no severe symptoms/drainage, see if resolve in 48-72 hours. -> give a written perscription, in case for later. 
				==- first line = HIGH dose amoxicillin 
				two ears, double the dose==
				- next line - augmented high dose amox-clavulanic acid, then cefdinir or ceftriaxone IM... 
				- if still no improvement, refer to ENT for potential tympanocentesis
- #clinics , not testable but look at as much normal ears as possible on your 1st clinical year to see normal patients!!!
- often theyll still have a chronic effusion, even when the ear infection clears - counsel parents on that. after a couple of months, then they do ENT in case of hearing loss.
	- **complication - acute mastoiditis - basically ears pinna is down and out with posterior auricular disease. urgent to ED**
- decrease risk - breastfeeding, no bottle propping instead of actively giving the baby the bottle, pacifier use past an age. 
	- **vaccinate! pneumoccocal and flu!!**

case 2 - 9 yo female, 24 hrs right otalgia + yellow ear drainage, been to a lake, **no fever** nor sick symptoms. **pain with manipulation of ear**, erythema of right external auditory canal, TM with yellow exudate 
- "swimmers ear" = otitis externa = inflammation of external auditory canal, infectious allergic or dermatologic, highest in childhood, dec over time 
	- pseudomonas and s. aureus, **peaks in the summer** as opposed to being like acute otitis media which peaks in the summer. 
	- treat - clean ear via otoscope + loop-tipped ear currete + then irrigate if TM intact. 
	- topical antibiotics/steroids - 
		- fluoroquinolone ofloxacin + ciprofloxacin 
		- 2nd line neomycin/tobramycin/gentamycin - more potential for otoxicity + make sure there's TM. 
		- can take 48 hrs to take effect, return if develop fever + no change. 
		- can shower, but no submerging ear
	- prevention - no digging in ear and no cleaning 

case 7 yo , fever, malaise, sore throat, abdominal pain, dec appetite 
- normal, but anterior cervical lad, tonsils erythematous tonsils w/ exudate, uvula might stick to the tonsils a bit (have them swallow a sip of water to get back to midline)
	- peaks - winter + early spring
	- Group A strep / strep pyogenes!!! = **strep pharyngitis**
	- **spontaneous resolve in 3-5 days but still will treat bc we wanna avoid rheumatic fever**; start within 9 days of symptom onset!! *not testable, but pandas might exist, but it's controversial*
		- LOW-dose amoxicillin/penicillin, low bc you just have one throat. 
- strep pharyngitis - scarlet fever - 
	- circumoral pallor, strawberry tongue, scarlatinoform rash 
will only test if pretest liklihood is high + don't test after a course of treatment... and don't test in kids less than 3 yrs.. test exposure
- 25% of school aged kids are already colonized , asymptomatic 
- rapid antigen detection test - high sensitivity, low sensitivity.. then a throat culture gold standard. 

case - 13 mos old, diaper rash a few days, then the rash seen bumps on hands, and then her feet. erythematous macules... yellow halo when ulcerated
- distinct - oral enanthem + viral exanthem - on tonuge + buccal mucosa.+ / - low grade fever; mild clinical syndrome, just resolution in 7-10 days, supportive care + maybe draining the mouth papules? 
- **hand foot and mouth dz** - most commonly coxsackievirus A 
- fecal oral, and respiratory, freq outbreaks in daycares + schools, mostly <5-7 yo
- summer and fall peak. make sure you handwash - may return to public when you're feeling well - **shedding happens for weeks, like forever** so having the rash is just whatever. 
herpangina - we don't really distinguish between this and the oral enanthem bc they're both coxsackie A ; but the ulcers are at the back of their mouth, **super painful** + **abrupt fever**

case - facial rash, 3 days cold symptoms + rhinorrhea + congestion - small bump under nose that progressed to reddening ;; pink papule breaking open with yellow crustiness
- **impetigo**- contagious superficial bacterial infection for 2-5 yo 
- cold , kids itch skin, and then **staph aureus** mostly would invade, can be primary or secondary in that regard
	- insect bites, broken skin etc. 
most common type - nonbullous - papules -> vesicles -> rupture and scab into honey colored crusts 
bullous impetigo - on trunk or extremities usually 
	vescicles enlarge, ruptures on own, **leaves a thin brown crust, large red lesions**
treat wit - topical **mupirocin - or oral antibiotics like cephalexin if its' everywhere**
- prevention = handwashing. they can go to school, just with contact precautions. 

case - 7 mos, cough + fever, nasal congestion + drainage + worsening cough ... tachypneic, diffuse rhonchi, wheezing in all lung fields. copious nasal discharge 
if you hear abnormal lung sounds, automatically a lower respiratory tract infection 
- **bronchiolitis** - RSV most common - lower resp tract infection 
- mucus production = causes the wheezing + airway obstruction 
- **peak dec-mar, late winter, and managed outpatient.** 
- **common cold progressive** over 4-6 days, noisy, raspy breathing + audible shifting wheezing in fields - constantly changing, low grade fever, etc. very young infants - can present with apnea but not prodromal symptoms <2 mos old. 
no lab testing, clinical dx only - pulse ox necessary and NO CXR
- supportive treatment 
- correlation between bronchiolitis and asthma happening in the future. recurrence common but less severe in each 
	- vaccination - RSV in mom in RSV szn, and then palivizumab prevention in high risk. 
	- nirsevimab - everybody - infants less than 8 months in first RSV szn and then 2nd one. - **this is new!!!**

case - 2 yo, cough + noisy breathing, harsh cough, funny breathing, but after calming down she's breathing normal 
- **croup - laryngotracheobronchitis**
- middle resp tract - mostly caused by parainfluenza type 1-3 
- causes airway inflammation + stridor in neck, follows common cold 
- most common in 6 mos-3 yrs old , resolves 3-5 days, have them calm down, cool humidified air. 
- peak fall + early winter ; humidified cool air improves symptoms so that can help... or with the AC in the car. 
	- **steeple sign** - subglottic narrowing, basically airway narrows slightly then widens again . this can distinguish this from **epiglottitis**
	- complication  of viral croup - **bacterial tracheitis- s. aureus, decompensation following it** - returns with fever + toxic appearing. 
- treat - IM steoids or oral - often just use oral dexamethasone outpatient 
	- if they got stridor at rest, give inhaled epinephrine - reducing subglottic edema by vasoconstricting but might produce rebound effect - not given outpatient. monitor in ED 
	- there's a westley croup severity score you can use for when you need to manage it in ED 
		- common - stridor when crying
		- at rest - should NOT have stridor = just give them the steroids. 
epiglottitis - historically caused by h. flu 
- very very sick, caused by other bacteria too
- **sniffling position, tripod posture + hyperetended neck, not potato voice**, muffled. sore throat, fever, drooling. 
- xray - **thumb sign , thickened and dark** - note - we should not do imaging and immediately intubate them + give empiric antibiotics cephalosporin + vancomycin 
pertussis - 
- whooping cough, most contagious (catarrhal stage, nonspecific) in 2 wks, 1-10 yo, infants <6 mos most severely affected bc unvax but they'll present with apnea. 
- parxysmal - classi, lasts 2-4 wks , thick mucus, and then make a whoop with forceful inhalation against narrowed glottis 
- convalescent stage - gradual resolution of symptoms over 1-2 wks 
- PCR test for this! due to community outreah. but treat imemdiately - 2+ wks coughing + one pertussis symptoms 
	- **macrolide antibiotics azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythrmycin**
	- all close contacts macrolide prophalaxis.
	- DTaP given 5x from age 2 mos - 4 yrs old. 
	- Tdap in adolescence + then to 3rd trimester pregnant women, also to the other close contact. 

case 18 mos old, parents played, refusal to move arm, fussing when parents tried to move arm. no distress, holding arm pronate + flexed, **no swelling or boney tenderness**
- **radial head subluxation, nursemaid's elbow**
- typically 1-4 yo, common, basically the annular ligament gets trapped over the radial head and gets trapped - 
- given dx based on hx, injury + exam, no xray needed
- treatment - reduce with forearm supination + flexion or hyperpronation... flexes it up, feel it pop back in place. leave room + return with special prize + watch for extension. show parents this video - so make sure they know and so that parents can learn to do it themselves !!! bc high rate of repeated nursemaids. 

## Highlights for -FPC Continuity of Care and Impact on Relationships_Haley
- Alternative views- 3 types of continuity of care[^15]
	- Informational continuity - use and transfer of info from one provider to another, making sure that current care is appropriate[^15]
	- Management continuity - consistent, coherent + responsive approach to the care. am i managing it the same way my subspecialists are[^15]
	- Relational continuity - therapeutic relation between an individual pt w/ one or more providers. soo much bigger than we think[^15]
- Care coordination - organizing pt care activities sharing info among all participants concerned w/ pt care to achieve safer + more effective care[^15]
	- Preplanned conversations = like advanced care planning[^15]
- Effectiveness of care coordination - look @[^15]
	- Hospital readmission, morbidity/mortality, prescriptions filled, time to follow up appointment[^15]
- Hotspotting- interventions - as an attempt to mitigate "superusers"[^15]
	- 80/ 20 rule - 20% of the USA accounts for 80% of healthcare expenditure[^15]
	- Superutilizers - frequent contact w healthcare system but minimal improvement in their health[^15]
	- **It doens't work,,, basically care and reductions vs standard care is not that big[^15]**
- Ppl spend so much in acute crises. -> result in them spending a lot more money, but this is really temporary, like the crisis could resolve in a small amount of time. and then they stop using the care as much.[^15]
- Transitions of care - high risk times- whenever we move from one care center to another, this is a massive risk to the patient.[^15]
	- Hospital discharge - transitional care management , case management/placement (readmission within 30 days is a major flag - how do we follow what meds we do)[^15]
	- Clinic referral - referral coordinators, patient feedback (then the referral might not be picked up!!!; and patient voicemails aren't good)[^15]
	- Shift changes - iPASS, SBAR[^15]
	- Leaving post-acute care - Home health, pcp f/u[^15]
	- Weekends - staffing continuity, call coverage - everything flips bc no one wants to work these![^15]
- Acute care intervention -[^15]
	- Bundled ; early discharge planning, like when you go home, who's taking care of you? etc.[^15]
	- Patient education, and then the pharmacist shows up[^15]
- Community intervention[^15]
	- Predictive - deployed community health workers, behavioralists, nurse care managers[^15]
	- Not helpful for medicare pts but helpful for medicaid (low SDOH, so basically environmental).[^15]
- Chronic care management[^15]
	- Monthly calls, bilable service from care coordinators to help pts achieve set goals from provider to improve chronic conditions[^15]
- Collab care management[^15]
	- Focused on medicare, mental health and psych patient[^15]
	- Partnership w primary care physician, care manager / coordinator, psych consultant[^15]
- Social isolation point - loneliness - subective response associated w/ social isolation - loss or lack of companionship -[^15]
- Societal level[^15] - policy making 
	- FMLA - family med leave act - you can leave work and not get fired if you need to care for an ill family member[^15]

## Highlights for -FPC Childhood Immunizations Vaccines Victims of their Own Success_Khawaja
- Fence sitter - might have articles or a lot of questions about the vaccines, more mistrust + distrust in you as a provider. can gt fully vacinated or sometimes they are vaccinated. *place where we make the most diff*[^16]
- Fully unvax - white, higher income, more educated, full acess but refuses[^16]
- Under vaxxed - public insurance/uninsured, AA, lower income , less edu, miss due to system issues. - takes a lot of time to set up a new schedule + education. we need to have a convo with them[^16]
- SC only med and religious exemption[^16]
- Concerns - safety, ASD, ingredients, quantity of vax, pain for kid, and politicization.[^16]
- Vaccines are toxic - thimerosal[^16]
- Mercury based preservative to prevent bacterial growth . not the same as mercury ... thought to cause neuro effects[^16]
- Has been removed by FDA , but still used in multi dose flu vaccines + DTaP - Hib -[^16]
- Was used in processing but later removed, trace amounts.[^16]
- Adjuvants - aluminum mostly - make stronger immune response[^16]
- It's also in air, food, water, comparable to amount exposed thru breastmilk + formula[^16]
- Possible link w asthma[^16]
- You can lessen your aluminum burden by not using tin foil, pans, etc,,, basically other ways.[^16]
- Tricky to discuss about religion - encourage to talk to their religious leaders abt vaccines and their concerns.[^16]
- Political hesitancy - acknowledge conflicting info, refocus on shared common goal of child health, avoid direct challenges, reinforce yourself as trusted messenger.[^16]
- Open ended, affirmations, reflections, ask perm to share, autonomy support - all Motivational intrviewing for vaccine counseling.[^16]
- Alt schedules - more fear made, not evidence based, prolongs time child is susceptible to certain illnesses - the last ditch effort, lots of fear mongering[^16]
- Debunk by telling them where the source is and who's the author "he lost his lisence bc pts died or almost died of preventable diseases."[^16]
- Use prescriptive language - ur kid is due for their ___ today, do you have any questions about it - just assume they'll have the vaccine.[^16]

## Highlights for -FPC Global Health_Koval
- World bank funds based on income, using Gross National Income[^17]
- Low income, low middle, upper mid, and high income[^17] LMIC - low middle income country[^17]
- Based on international org recs - *WHO or unicef* - tells us the *sustainable development goals* - we have 17 , each have targets and each is mapped with an indicator.[^17]
- Top 3 causes of maternal mortality[^17]
	- Hemorrhage[^17]
	- Htn[^17]
	- Sepsis[^17]
- Epidemiologic transition - when birth and death rates decrease due to better quality of life for women, and increase in life expectancy and then a plateau - stronger health system will help transition us.[^17]
- Biggest thing that causes most DALYs = neonatal conditions bc of the life expectency + disabilty years. also why some diarrheal diseases go up in measured dz burden,[^17] But COPD goes down bc it primarily affects older people[^17]
[^17]: [[-FPC Global Health_Koval]]

## Highlights for -FPC Children in Global Health_Summer
- Globally - most common cause of mortality = pneumonia ; acute respiratory infections![^18]
	- Caused by RSV, influenza, etc. usually malnurished + deficiencies + suboptimal treatment options.[^18]
	- Increasing antimicrobial resistance in many countries[^18]
- Most common perinatal/neonate death = prematurity[^18]
- Diarrheal diseases = caused by rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, reduced by ORS!! (:[^18]
	- Zinc supplementation global (not in the us)[^18]
	- Diarrheal illness will weaken gi, that give malnutrition which causes other infections so much.[^18]
- WHO - exclusive breastfeeding - continue up until 2 years, but introduce safe complementary foods at 6 months[^18]
- Vaccine preventable dz - biggest contagious - measles. most contagious disease!!![^18]
- Polio - impact kids under 5 yo, 1/200 infection leads to paralysis[^18]
	- Endemic in afghanistan + pakistan.[^18]
