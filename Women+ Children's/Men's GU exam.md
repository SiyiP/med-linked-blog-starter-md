roll out leg to open the arrea 
palpate rolling horizontally over inguinal ligament then vertically over femoral artery , beginnning at the iliac crest down. 
note: masses, enlarged nodes (some might be acceptable), tenderness
suprapubic area palpation for the same thing 

hernias - visual inspection + invagination into the inguinal canal within the loose scrotal skin 
- follow cord along to neck of scrotum at angle , then palpate the external inguinal ring (tell them to blow into arm or plug nose then act like you're exhaling, basically baring down)
	-bulge at tip of finger = indirect hernia
	side of finger = direct hernia 

scrotum - asking if they do regular self awareness thing? do it 
stretch out the folds

feel every vas def- pinch loose scrotal skin above each teesticle + pull lateral to id cord for bag of worms 
- if anything is apparent, might have to trans illuminate it 

penis inspection - visual with all surfaces of shaft + glans by rotating + stretching folds , then glans penis. 
- uncircumcised - pull pack the prepuce to expose it - ask the patient to do so. 
palpation of glans + shaft, proximal to distal twice on ventral + lateral sides to migrate any discharge

ffinger might be cold. 
1) Place index finger at 45-degree angle against the anus,

3) roll the inserting finger in slowly and **follow the anterior**  wall, down and forward of rectum toward the umbilicus as far as the finger will reach. Locate the prostate  by asking the patient to “bear down”, which will cause the prostate to lift, and make it  easier to assess. After locating, sweep lightly over the top of the prostate
palpate it firmly in case of internal nodularity(they can feel it), and then do a 360 degree rectum sweep. 
keep removed finger out of sight and then give them tissues.
