|The karyotype indicates **a balanced translocation between the q arms of chromosomes 5 and 8.** The individual is normal because there is **no loss of DNA and no indication that a gene was disrupted in either chromosome.** 
- A Robertsonian translocation occurs by fusion of q arms of **2 acrocentric chromosomes [13, 14, 15, 21, 22].** 45 total
- A paracentric inversion occurs when part of the p arm or q arm of a chromosome breaks off and is re-ligated "upside down". 
- Monosomy is loss of an entire chromosome and trisomy is an extra chromosome.

| A SNP microarray can not detect a **balanced chromosomal rearrangement such as a translocation or inversion because all of the DNA sequences are still present in the genome.** A SNP microarray can detect DNA insertions and deletions in a given region of a chromosome based on corresponding intensity of the fluorescent signal. However, the sequences on a SNP microarray are designed to probe for polymorphisms in the genome, not random point mutations. A DNA sequencing method would be required to detect a point mutation. - \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|If a gene duplication is present, values for beta allele frequency cluster at 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1.

| A reciprocal translocation is exchange between 2 different chromosomes. An isochromosome consists of either 2 p arms or 2 q arms that are identical to each other.

|This karyotype is translocation Down syndrome: 46,XY,rob(14q;21q)+21. **The individual has 2 copies of chromosome 21 and a Robertsonian translocation (arrow) that consists of the fused q arms of chromosomes 14 and 21 inherited from a parental carrier.** Thus, an extra q arm of chromosome 21 is present. The p arms of 14 and 21 are lost in a Robertsonian translocation. A **male carrier** for this Robertsonian translocation would have 45 chromosomes: 45,XY,rob(14q;21q).|   |
- we see extra q arm of chromosome 21 when one is fused onto the other. 

Because nondisjunction occurs in the **mother**, th**e homozygous father (CC) must contribute only one of his C alleles in chromosome 2**1. The mother is heterozygous (C/T) for this allele in chromosome 21. Thus, nondisjunction in meiosis I would produce gametes that contain both her **maternal** and **paternal** copies of chromosome 21, that is, **one** with the C allele and **one** with T allele. As a result, the affected male child would most likely be CCT with one copy of chromosome 21 (C allele) contributed by the father, and both maternal and paternal copies of chromosome 21 contributed by the mother (one with the C allele and the other with the T allele). - basically the whole thing from mom is passed down 
If nondisjunction occurred during meiosis II of oogenesis, then two genotypes would be possible: CCC (one C from the father and two sister chromatids with the C allele that did not separate) or CTT (C from father and two sister chromatids with the T allele that did not separate).
